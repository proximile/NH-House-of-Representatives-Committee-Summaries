he's one of those lucky people who has
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
the same vowel
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
one person excellent
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
excellent attendance i'm impressed all
 
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
excellent attendance i'm impressed all
right

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
so to repeat uh we will not be having
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
any committee meetings
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
next week by because they're
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
testing out the procedures on the
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
election law committee
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
so but i have just started to work on
 
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
so but i have just started to work on
scheduling

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
and we have four early bills that have
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be out before the others
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
that are on the pensions pension system
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore it makes sense that the
 
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
and therefore it makes sense that the
first

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
bills we will be hearing will be for the
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh so for homework
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
you can read these bills pam is
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
collecting data
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
from previous experience with these
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
the only one that is that is a totally
 
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:03.829 align:start position:0%
the only one that is that is a totally
new

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
issue is is a technical correction that
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative schuett put in
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
the rest are all uh repeaters
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
so pam is collecting the data that we've
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
had in the past on these and that should
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
make the hearings go more smoothly
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right and so for
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the orientation pam who who's uh
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
speaking jill perlow from the attorney
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
general's office

and we'll uh we'll start on executive

and we'll uh we'll start on executive

orders
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay she is on her way

happy to be here today and i understand
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
what i've been asked to present uh to
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
this committee is just an overview of
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
the emergency power statutes um
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
that have really come to the forefront
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
over this past
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
year and so with that i've got a little
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
bit of an overview that i'm
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
planning to walk through and then i'm
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions um
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
so just to first introduce myself i'm
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
jill perlow i'm a senior assistant
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general with the department of
 
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
attorney general with the department of
justice

i'm also the chief of our client
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
counseling unit in the in the civil
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
bureau so i'm
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
familiar and work with many of the state
 
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.630 align:start position:0%
familiar and work with many of the state
agencies

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
across the state in looking at um the
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
emergency power statutes there's really
 
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.230 align:start position:0%
emergency power statutes there's really
three

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
primary sources
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
that come into play the first is in rsa4
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
and it's sections 45-47
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
the next one is rsa21p and it's the
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
sections 34-53 that's the homeland
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
security and emergency management
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
section and then in certain
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances not all emergencies
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
we might be looking also at rsa 141c
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is within public health and that
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
is communicable diseases
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
so those are the real primary sources of
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
emergency powers
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
but before i jump really into the nitty
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
gritty of some of the details of um
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
those statues and what those powers are
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
and how they get implemented
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
um i always like to start with why to
 
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.430 align:start position:0%
um i always like to start with why to
understand

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
maybe what all those different pieces
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
are and where
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
i look to and saying well why are there
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
these emergency powers is the purpose
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's been laid out in the statutes by
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the best description of that
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
please let me interrupt
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
for a second pam
 
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.710 align:start position:0%
for a second pam
[Music]

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
screen i'm sorry
 
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:18.150 align:start position:0%
screen i'm sorry
that's

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure yes and actually uh miss perlow
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a presentation or some notes
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
that you could send us it would be very
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
much appreciated either
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay i do i do have some notes that i've
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
pieced together i've put them a little
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit into
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
i sometimes unsuccessfully share my
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
screen so i'm happy to share my screen
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to just send them after the
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
fact i'm really just kind of walking
 
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
fact i'm really just kind of walking
through

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
all of the the provisions so whatever
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
you would prefer
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
um how about both share your screen and
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
then send
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
us the uh the file when when we're done
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
sure i will do my best i know pam
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
we were talked about whether i'd be able
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
to share my screen and
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
you should have the the ability to share
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
like magic does it look like an
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
actual slideshow though that's always
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
well you can see the whole
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
um right but let me see if i can
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
all right figuring out i have too many
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
screens and which
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
one it has to be on to make sure it
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
shares properly it's always
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the excitement so okay so this is where
 
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.150 align:start position:0%
the excitement so okay so this is where
i'll

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
i will start back over um with just
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is the outline of the three primary
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
sources of
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
emergency powers we're looking at rsa4
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
colon 45-47
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's the government the governor's
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
powers statute 21p
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
34-53 is our homeland security and
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
emergency management powers
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then 141c is looking at like public
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
i just didn't know if someone had a
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
question so
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
where i was then moving to is the why
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
are there emergency powers and looking
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the purpose
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
which is in rsa 21p 34 lays it out and
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the state is
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared to preserve the
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
lives and the property of the people of
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
the state when faced with
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
natural and human-caused disasters by
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
providing emergency management powers
 
00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.550 align:start position:0%
providing emergency management powers
too

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
and it's broken down into the governor
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
other executive heads of governing
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
bodies of the state such as local
 
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.069 align:start position:0%
bodies of the state such as local
officials

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
having local organizations for emergency
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
management to make sure that
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
those emergency powers are coordinated
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
with other states and the federal
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
government um with that coordination
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
being to the maximum extent possible so
 
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.949 align:start position:0%
being to the maximum extent possible so
that

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
purpose is found in 21p 34 and
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
sets the stage for kind of everything
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
that flows from it
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's the why are we here and so what
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
are the types of disasters that's also
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
found in this purpose
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the statute and so it's
 
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the statute and so it's
fires

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
fires
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
floods hurricanes earthquakes uh a
 
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
floods hurricanes earthquakes uh a
prolonged

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
prolonged
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
power outage um disruption or
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
contamination of the food or water
 
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.230 align:start position:0%
contamination of the food or water
supply

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
degradation of critical facilities and
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
vital systems disruption of
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
communication systems
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
or other natural technological or human
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
causes including acts of terrorism so
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
different types of disasters that might
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
implicate a state of emergency and and
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
looking at these emergency powers so
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
this is the types of issues that the
 
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
this is the types of issues that the
powers

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
were designed to think about respond to
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
to preserve the lives and property of
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state so that's that's the why
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and to kind of move on to the who what
 
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.389 align:start position:0%
and to kind of move on to the who what
where

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
when of of these emergency powers the
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
first is who
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
who can declare a state of emergency and
 
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
who can declare a state of emergency and
there's

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
two bodies that can either the governor
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
or the legislature
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that is found in rsa4 colon 45
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph one we'll get into the
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that a little bit further
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
but there's
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
two different individual ore bodies
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
that can do that but what is a state of
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
emergency i mean we just rattled off a
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of or i just rattled off a bunch
 
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.150 align:start position:0%
bunch of or i just rattled off a bunch
of

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
different disasters that could occur
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
fires floods but they're not
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
not each one would necessarily result in
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency and it needs to be
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
a condition
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
situation or set of circumstances so one
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
of those types of events
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be so extremely
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
hazardous or dangerous to life or
 
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.990 align:start position:0%
hazardous or dangerous to life or
property

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
that and then i highlighted
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary measures some type of
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary measures need to be taken
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
and we find that definition in rsa 21p
 
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
and we find that definition in rsa 21p
35

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
35
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
and to connect the dots a little bit
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
we've got rsa4 colon 45 tells us
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
that the governor or the legislature can
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency as defined
 
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:05.190 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency as defined
in

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
21p 35. so
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
we've got some type of incident has
 
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
we've got some type of incident has
happened

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just your typical unfortunately
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
we have typical floods we have floods we
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
have fires we have snow storms we have
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
all sorts of different events can happen
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
but it's got to be
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
so hazardous that we need to take some
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
type of extraordinary action
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we know who can act we know under
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
what circumstances
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
someone can act what about where where
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
does this event have to be occurring and
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
so we need to think about
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
where is this conditioned situation set
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
of circumstances occurring it's got to
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
be within the state
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's rsa4 colon 45 tells us that
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it could be either focused in a
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
particular area
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
or if it's beyond local control it could
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
impact the whole state and the statutes
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
recognize this
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
could be narrow or broad
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
and it really depends we've had snow
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
storms that only impact
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
um up north we could have an ice storm
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
bad in the western part of the state you
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
could have a hurricane type event
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
weather event that's only on the
 
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
weather event that's only on the
seacoast

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
so you can see where there could be a
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
need to respond
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
on a just more local basis but it could
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
also impact the whole state you could
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a storm that impacts the whole
 
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
have a storm that impacts the whole
state

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
so we've got who we've got what we've
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
got where
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
also when is a consideration and
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
it needs to be this type of disaster of
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
major proportions but we don't have to
 
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
major proportions but we don't have to
wait

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
it could be either that it's imminent or
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
it could be that it's already occurred
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
so it could be that we see the storm
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
coming we're monitoring the storm we
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be bad enough that
 
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be bad enough that
perhaps

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
it requires a proactive declaring of a
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
state of emergency in an area
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
or perhaps we don't know that it's
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
coming it could be a fire that
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
occurred and really would devastate a
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
particular area
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
it could be something that sudden
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
happened maybe a storm that was worse
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
than anyone anticipated
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so we're responding after the fact
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
so it's either imminent we can see it
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
coming we take proactive actions
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
or it's already occurred and so then we
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
and well we get to the how so we've kind
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
of got all of the pieces together
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
we you know we've got either we've got
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
an event that's happened
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
that we feel needs uh extraordinary
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
measures to be taken
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
um it's happening in a particular area
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's either imminent
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
or it's about to happen and so there
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
needs to be a response so how do we get
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
there how do we start implementing these
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
emergency powers
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
and it's that the governor or the
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor will do it
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
by issuing an executive order
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
or the legislature by concurrent
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
resolution declares the state of
 
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.669 align:start position:0%
resolution declares the state of
emergency

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
and there's some specific requirements
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going through all of those
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
steps we just did
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
what is the nature of the emergency is
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
it a storm is it
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
a disease a communicable disease that
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
is it a um flooding type situation is
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
there a man-made action that's happened
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
um where is that happening
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
what is making this an emergency what's
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
brought it about what makes it such a
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
threat to
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
life and safety and what is it that
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're facing with and then how long
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
do we anticipate this emergency to to
 
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
do we anticipate this emergency to to
exist

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
with a cap in place it's limited to 21
 
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.070 align:start position:0%
with a cap in place it's limited to 21
days

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so you could envision a situation
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
where there's a storm you think it's
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
only going to be one or two days maybe
 
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.710 align:start position:0%
only going to be one or two days maybe
three

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
it gets declared for those couple of
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
days at the end of those couple of days
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
you need to assess does this
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
have things returned to normal are we
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
able to lift the emergency do we need to
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
extend it
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
um if you're unsure on the time it could
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
be up to the 21 days
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of 21 days it's a
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
requirement that
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know the governor or the legislature
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
reassess the situation are we still
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
facing all of those same factors and
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
then it can be renewed
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't get renewed it just ends
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
after the end of 21 days so
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
that is yep sorry to interrupt but the
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
raise hand button is not visible on my
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
screen for some reason
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
for how many years can the governor uh
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
continue to renew
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in statute that would
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
cap that it is a requirement that every
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
21 days
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that an assessment of the situation
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
um be considered whether it needs to be
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
renewed again
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um the how does a state of emergency end
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
is really the next three
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
bullets on the slides here one it just
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't get renewed it's
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to expire at the end of the 21
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
days or at the end of whatever period of
 
00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
days or at the end of whatever period of
time

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
an emergency was declared if maybe
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of a
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
21 day cycle or maybe you're in the
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
middle of you've declared it's been
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
declared for
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
a week or two weeks and you assess the
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
situation and say
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
wait this there's no longer this
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
imminent threat there's no longer a need
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
for these emergency
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
um actions then the governor is required
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
to issue an executive order ending
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and then the
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
third piece is that the legislature by
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
may also terminate a state of emergency
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the governor has declared
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
so those are the three ways in statute
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
that an emergency can end
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
so so long as those conditions still
 
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
so so long as those conditions still
exist

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the governor was to find that those
 
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.149 align:start position:0%
and the governor was to find that those
conditions

00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
still exist a renewal could continue to
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
and so once a state of emergency has
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
been declared that then triggers
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
a series of emerging emergency powers
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
the whole i concept back to that why
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of this
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
is in order to protect the life
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
and property of the state extraordinary
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
measures need to be taken so this is the
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
set of extraordinary measures that are
 
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.669 align:start position:0%
set of extraordinary measures that are
then

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
made available upon the declaration of a
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple sources of these
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
powers as well four colon 45
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
provides a list of them it includes
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
assuming control of emergency management
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
forces and helpers in the state
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
obtaining and transferring materials or
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
services for emergency management
 
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.950 align:start position:0%
services for emergency management
purposes

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
evacuating part of the population
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
as i read through these i think of the
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
different types of emergencies you could
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
face and you could have a weather event
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
that might require an evacuation of an
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
area you could have a fire event that
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
could require an evacuation removal from
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
office of any public officer who's
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
engaged in emergencies
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
other functions powers and duties as are
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to promote and secure the
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
safety and protection
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the population and to declare an
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary location of
 
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary location of
government

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the powers in four
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
colon 45.
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
additional powers are found in 4 46
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
47 and then 21p and those include
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
acquiring or disposing of real or
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
personal property entering mutual aid
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
agreements with other states
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
having emergency lines of succession for
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
appointed officials in state government
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
making amending suspending orders rules
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
and regulations necessary
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
to respond to the emergency accepting
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
services equipment supplies and funds
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
and then also local governor and local
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions can accept
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
services supplies materials from private
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and companies
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so those are some additional
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
emergency powers that are provided
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
again keeping in mind the purpose was to
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
provide the governor and other executive
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
officials within local political
 
00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:28.710 align:start position:0%
officials within local political
subdivisions

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
certain powers you can see this comes
 
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.549 align:start position:0%
certain powers you can see this comes
through

00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
in some of these different emergency
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
power provisions
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then specific in the public health
 
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
and then specific in the public health
arena

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
arena
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
so these may not be triggered and would
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
likely not be triggered in those
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios of the
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
snow storm and the fire but when we have
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
a communicable disease for example
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
we look to the hhs commissioner and
 
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
we look to the hhs commissioner and

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the governor the
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%

include ordering individuals to seek

operating temporary acute care centers
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
and so that is a very high level
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
overview just to try and walk us through
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i think i can
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
stop sharing my screen
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
of as i laid out the kind of who uh
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
where when why's and hows of the
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
emergency powers um
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
including how these get uh
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
triggered through the governor's actions
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
or through the legislature's act and
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
actions when those types of um what
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
types of incidents could
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
result in them being triggered and then
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
what are the powers that come with
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
the triggering of those emergency powers
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
so with that that's my overview i don't
 
00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.230 align:start position:0%
so with that that's my overview i don't
know

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
if there's questions or how to best uh
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
turn that back over to you for any
 
00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
turn that back over to you for any
follow-up

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay there will undoubtedly be questions
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
um if people would raise their hand
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i noticed
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
sorry the
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
emergency powers could be removed by
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
action of the legislature or the
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh data of emergency i guess i should
 
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.029 align:start position:0%
uh data of emergency i guess i should
say

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if the legislature
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
took that step
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
would that nullify the governor's
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
ability to accept
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
so once um if the legislature was to
 
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
so once um if the legislature was to
take

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
that step you know as we talked about
 
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:21.909 align:start position:0%
that step you know as we talked about
that

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
once the um powers
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
are once the state of emergency is
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
declared then
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
a number of powers are exercised
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
i would have to kind of take a deeper
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
dive on that specific question
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
on you know how it is 21p 43 because
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's the specific
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
acceptance of federal funds um relate to
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the existence of a state of emergency
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and then also another question would
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
in the event that the legislature was to
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
undo the state of emergency
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
are there limits on the governor's
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
then declare an additional state of
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
emergency if the conditions were so
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
interesting question in terms of how
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
those two connect um
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a good it's a good
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
question the concept
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be that you know it's only those
 
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
would be that you know it's only those
powers

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
um are implicated with the existence of
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and uh we'd have
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
to take a close look at how that
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
specific statute relates
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ms perlow if you could do
 
00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:28.789 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ms perlow if you could do
that

00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
looking we would very much like to to
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
and representative lucas uh hello thank
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and actually related to
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
that previous question i think you'd
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
also have to look into
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the federal rules on the disbursement of
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
the money as well
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
but my i have two questions hopefully
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
brief one is
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um what if anything is in the
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
constitution the new hampshire
 
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.389 align:start position:0%
constitution the new hampshire
constitution

00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
related to declaring the state of
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
now i'm going off the top of my head
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
which is always dangerous i don't think
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's anything specific that says oh
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency um
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
power authority however you know the
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
constitution's written in a broader
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
brush of
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
the governor as the supreme executive of
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
the state and then and has some broader
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
concepts along those lines um as well
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay so you could please look into it
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
and and just uh double check and see if
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's any anything at all in there
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
and uh excuse me representative i'd like
 
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.070 align:start position:0%
and uh excuse me representative i'd like
to

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
while she's looking into that there is a
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
statement that the power to suspend the
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
execution of the laws is reserved to the
 
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.230 align:start position:0%
execution of the laws is reserved to the
legislature

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that i think needs to be looked at
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
in consideration of the
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
executive powers please continue yeah
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up um another question
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
and and that is i mean in the statutes
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
just listed
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
it said the governor could if i remember
 
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
correctly you know suspend or modify
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
regulations and
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
there was something else in there but i
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe it said statute so
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know does the governor have any
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
power to modify
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
any existing statutes that have been
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
so in terms of so the
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to provide uh some
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
additional information on each of these
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with the
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
provision in the constitution about the
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislature's ability to
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
suspend statutes
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
in passing the various emergency powers
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that have been outlined here it has you
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
know as
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
it has given the governor some very
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
broad authority
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
um including the one uh representative
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
are citing which is in four colon 45
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
nope not that one um my other one four
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
colon 47
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
3 which is make suspend make amends to
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
spend and rescind
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
necessary orders rules and regulations
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to respond
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the emergency and also
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
a broad authority to take such other um
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
have such other functions powers and
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
duties as are necessary
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
and so the legislature
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
in passing these laws has
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
provided the governor the authority to
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
take these additional actions
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
um and so those are the places that
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
the governor has looked to in taking
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
this authority to suspend statutes
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up but i can in in following
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
up i can piece together those so that
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not just doing it on the fly right
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
here for you um
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
but those are the the pieces that were
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
connected for that
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for that and just one
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
final thing and that is
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
um on that section that you know
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
goes on about all other uh actions is
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
there any limiting principle i mean
 
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.230 align:start position:0%
there any limiting principle i mean
basically

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
if there's a declared state of emergency
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
is there anything the governor cannot do
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
if he believes it's necessary related to
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that is always a fair
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
question it does need to be
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know to promote and secure the
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
safety and protection of the civilian
 
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
safety and protection of the civilian
population

00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um there are limiting principles in
 
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.789 align:start position:0%
and um there are limiting principles in
there

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that that is uh the purpose
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
of the actions that are being taken and
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
the limitations that are on it all right
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
all right that's a that's amazing um
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and ms furlow and we
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%

three pieces three questions that i
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
think i took down and if there's
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
anything further i'm happy to follow
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
back up as well
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure we'll be seeing you when we
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
hear the bills we've got on this issue
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
good to be prepared sounds good thank
 
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
good to be prepared sounds good thank
you

you
 
00:34:43.709 --> 00:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
oh if no one objects
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think we will go to the basic
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
introduction to rule making that we had
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
planned for this afternoon because i
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
just as rather we finished this morning
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
if i could ask a question uh i'd love to
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
to do that my only question is given
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the time of that meeting was
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendar
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
please leave a message after the tone um
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know is that a problem well i don't
 
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
you know is that a problem well i don't
know

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh was it wasn't the whole or a
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee orientation
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
noticed for 10 o'clock oh i'm sorry
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're right i was just thinking that
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
your notice to us had it broken up but
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in the calendar thank you
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
so this is a very high level
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
introduction to rulemaking
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to get the details
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
the director of the administrative rules
 
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.670 align:start position:0%
the director of the administrative rules
office

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
scott eaton is preparing a
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
multi-part introduction to rule making
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
for the new members of gelcar
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
so you're more than welcome to it to uh
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
participate in that but for the
 
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
participate in that but for the
committee

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
members we we really need to have
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
the top level position on rulemaking
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
so an administrative rule is written by
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
an agency and it defines
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
their dealing with the public it does
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
and sometimes
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
other portions of government it does not
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh it deals with the regu the community
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's regulated or interested in what
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are valid for 10
 
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.990 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are valid for 10
years

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they cannot be enforced after they
 
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
and they cannot be enforced after they
expire

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
expire
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was an accomplishment of just a
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
because a number of agencies were just
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
letting their rules expire
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
and kept on enforcing them regardless
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
but we've
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
we have actually clamped down on that
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
rules have the force and effect of law
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that means that writing rules is a
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislative activity
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire at least the
 
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire at least the
legislature

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
continues to get involved we don't just
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
tell the agency to
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
make rules and then let them go at it we
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
review and approve all the rules that
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
are in effect
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
the review is done primarily by the
 
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
the review is done primarily by the
staff

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the legislative uh sir
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules office and
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
the and then they are reviewed by the
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
or jail car i'm the vice chair this year
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
fonteno i believe are members of the
 
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.710 align:start position:0%
fonteno i believe are members of the
committee

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
our alternate and representative roy
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
penn scitec has been but isn't this year
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
so as a member of edna you're
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
high on the list of people to be tagged
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
basically these the staff will review
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
all rules
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
in excruciating detail and they work
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
with the agencies to make sure
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
that they comply with the statutory
 
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
that they comply with the statutory
authority

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
that they have the proper style and
 
00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
that they have the proper style and
formatting

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
formatting
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
and they have and that the what the
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
is defined the rules go through
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislative budget assistant
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
the same way bills do
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
so we look at the fiscal impact of the
 
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.430 align:start position:0%
so we look at the fiscal impact of the
rules

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
before we approve them um
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
jail car has five house members five
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
senators plus alternates and generally
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
the house alternates get a good workout
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
because the senators don't attend very
 
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
because the senators don't attend very
well

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
it meets every every month year round
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
jail car at holds public meetings and
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
it can approve a rule it can request
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
changes fixes and so forth generally
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
the agency will comply with a request
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
and come back with a revised
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
rule and then then we can do that
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
jail card does not have full authority
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
to object to rules
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh not meeting legislative intent
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
exceeding their authority
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
excessive fiscal impact and not in the
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
public interest
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
which is rather not as effective as we
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
as some people might like in particular
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
jail car cannot object to a rule
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
because they don't like the principle if
 
00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:56.230 align:start position:0%
because they don't like the principle if
the

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has in its glorious wisdom
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
passed a stupid law
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
then the agency has full authority to
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
write stupid rules to implement it
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we get a lot of attention
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
for something like that but jail car
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
cannot change a rule
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
that complies with the bad law we can
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
simply say
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have to fix the law okay
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
if there is a an objection jail car can
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
make a final objection which
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
can go either two ways if that's all
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
then the rule does not have the
 
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.589 align:start position:0%
then the rule does not have the
presumption

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
that it meets legislative intent so if
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's challenged in court
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
but if to really block it delcar can
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
put in a resolution to block the rule
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
which would have to which is can be
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
introduced basically at any time
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved by the house and
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
the senate and it blocks the rule
 
00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:00.630 align:start position:0%
the senate and it blocks the rule
completely

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
and this happens about once a year that
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
a final
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
objection is filed sometimes the agency
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
will change their rule
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
if they're sometimes the house and
 
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.349 align:start position:0%
if they're sometimes the house and
senate

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
will pass the resolution and block it in
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
which case the agency
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
needs to change their rule because it is
 
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:20.950 align:start position:0%
needs to change their rule because it is
not

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
in effect and
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes it the changes get worked out
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
we had one about the medical board
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
my first term where it passed the ha the
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
resolution passed the house
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then by the time it got to the
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
senate they worked out a deal with the
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
agency and changed the rule enough
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the resolution was not necessary
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's uh
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
oh rsa 541a
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
defines the whole rulemaking process we
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
are the keepers of 541a so any changes
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
to it will be coming to us
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
and we've got a few uh we
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
also are responsible to make sure that
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:08.950 align:start position:0%
also are responsible to make sure that
no

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
rule is passed by any committee or
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
by the house that has what's called
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
broad making broad rulemaking authority
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is where the law says
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know the agency will make rules to
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
implement the purpose of this chapter
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
we've tried to get rid of that in some
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
cases we were successful
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
in other cases it's still there it's
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
always a temptation for the legislature
 
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.170 align:start position:0%
to leave the details to somebody else
 
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.430 align:start position:0%
to leave the details to somebody else
[Music]

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
for example last last session i think it
 
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.430 align:start position:0%
for example last last session i think it
was

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
the pfest rules the legislature did not
 
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
the pfest rules the legislature did not
set

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
set a limit did not even say what the
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
the criteria were for setting element
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
des figure out of read the number and
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay and that's that's the high level
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
detail representative schmidt is going
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
to give you a few more um
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
points because he's been on jail car
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
longer than i have
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
carol can i ask a question certainly
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
so on the final objection where it has
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
to pass the house and the senate
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
is that a simple majority vote or is
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
super majority vote and also who can
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
file such an objection does it have to
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
be a member of jail car
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
or can it be any member of either body
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
a final objection is filed generally by
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
the chair of jail car
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
and because it's not during the normal
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill cycle
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to go to rules but
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
the rules committee essentially says to
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
jail car if you have a final objection
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
will bring it in any time and it is a
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
simple majority vote and it does not
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair um so
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um i very much agree
 
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um i very much agree
with

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
the chair's presentation regarding
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the new members of the committee
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
of course we are called the name of our
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee is executive departments and
 
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.309 align:start position:0%
committee is executive departments and
administration

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
which kind of makes us a little bit of a
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
mystery committee for
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
most of the representatives because
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
unlike most of the committee names where
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
the name
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
pretty well says what the committee does
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
or what his area of jurisdiction is
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
um executive departments and
 
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.870 align:start position:0%
um executive departments and
administration

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
it certainly says something about what
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
we do but uh but most
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
i remember before i was assigned to jail
 
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.550 align:start position:0%
i remember before i was assigned to jail
to

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
edna i i had really no idea what
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
what what the committee actually did
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
but our job is to oversee legislation
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
and to vet legislation which deals with
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
um the executive departments because we
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
all know that we have
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know three branches of government uh
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
the legislatures you know set
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
and adopts the statutes
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the executive branch is
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for implementing those
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh those statutes and in the course of
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
doing so it
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
it grants a certain aspect of its of its
 
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.630 align:start position:0%
it grants a certain aspect of its of its
power

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
to the executive department
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
to write rules to implement them but
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature jealously guards
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
its power to legislate and that's what
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
its power to legislate and that's what
the

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit is for
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
is to vet the rules which
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
the agency is is writing to implement
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
the statute to make sure that
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
that the rules do not and the two
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
primary pillars of the
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
of the administrative rules uh
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
oversight process are whether something
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
exceeds legislative authority and the
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
other is it it cannot be contrary to
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
those are the two main aspects that we
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
that our attorneys are we have three
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
a very experienced as the director has
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
been with the
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
it was administrative rules unit for
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
um and one of the attorneys has been
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
there for over 20 years
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
um and so they're as as carol said
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
they are extremely meticulous i mean
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
they'll draw little lines and say you
 
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
they'll draw little lines and say you
know

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
the comma goes down there or this needs
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be a new paragraph
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
so they look at absolutely everything
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
but the most important aspect is
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
is they make sure that the the rule does
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
not lead
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
exceed legislative authority nor be
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to legislative intent
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and carol already talked about the fact
 
00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
and carol already talked about the fact
that

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
there are three that the jail car cannot
 
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.549 align:start position:0%
there are three that the jail car cannot
present

00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative sorry rules from
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
um from being put in place by the
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh by the agency um
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
but uh if if we enter a fight
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
the normal process is if there's some
 
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.670 align:start position:0%
the normal process is if there's some
process

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
problem with a rule and i have to be a
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific here because
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh if we have a
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
a 15-page rule to implement a certain
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh authority um
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
is that is we call that a rule but every
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
little provision
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the of the rule is also referred to
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
as a rule
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
and ordinarily if there's a problem it's
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be the whole rule
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be some little provision
 
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.150 align:start position:0%
it's going to be some little provision
that

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that is at fault or
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
defective or whatever
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example of
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
that type of thing there was a statute
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
passed about
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
15 years ago to to ban smoking in
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants and bars
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
and in the course of the rule to
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
implement that statute
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
there was a an administrative fine
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
that was put in there in order to
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
provide the so-called hammer if you will
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
because if there were no fine
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
then the proprietor might say well i
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
don't like this
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
statute and i'm not going to implement
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
it and there's no penalty
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
so that so i can disregard the law and
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you that the
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
government can sanction me or my
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
establishment for
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
violating that statute um and so
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that and but the but
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
the the statute did not actually include
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
any authority to implement a fine
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
but the rule did and so uh
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
because we all recognize without a
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
penalty that people were going to
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
disregard the statute
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
more readily than if there were some
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
kind of cost
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the the i think the the fine that
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
that the that hhs put in there was about
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
either 50 or so or maybe a hundred
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
dollars for the first
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
violation um but there was no authority
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
for it and the
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
the agency recognized that we all
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
recognized it so that was an instance
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
filed a so-called joint resolution carol
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
already talked about that a little bit
 
00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.430 align:start position:0%
already talked about that a little bit
and

00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
so the the joint resolution did not stop
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
the whole rule
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
it only stopped the provision that
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
imposed that administrative fine
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and then it's like any other bill it
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
has to pass both chambers uh and if if
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
it does pass both chambers
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
then that particular aspect is is
 
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.870 align:start position:0%
then that particular aspect is is
prohibited

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and the agency recognized all that
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
they came in and asked the
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to support
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
the joint resolution but also to give
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
them the authority to
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
impose such a fine and that was the
 
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
impose such a fine and that was the
outcome

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
but carol said it happens about once a
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
year and i would say
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
in my 14 years of experience on gel car
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
that the joint resolutions are pretty
 
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
that the joint resolutions are pretty
rare

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
rare
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh because because the
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
the attorneys are going to see that
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
right off the bat
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say this can't pass
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
the jail car
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll get a joint resolution um
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so the agency wants to have the rule
 
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:06.150 align:start position:0%
and so the agency wants to have the rule
approved

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
because it has much more viability
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
in front of the courts if if the jail
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
car has
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
has approved it and that's one of the
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh the final objection pass
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
part of the of the statute of of our
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.829 align:start position:0%
part of the of the statute of of our
541a

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh does uh you know does not get adopted
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
too often
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
because um that also takes away
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state's backing of the the agency
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
and makes it more tempting for
 
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.670 align:start position:0%
and makes it more tempting for
stakeholders

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh to you know to take it to take the
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
agency to court
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
so peter can i ask a question of course
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
please do
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of the rules uh
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned are um to raise
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh fines and fees that were not put in
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
statute can you tell us what
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
the where those fines and fees go are
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
they if they're not designated in
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
statute do they automatically go to the
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
general fund or does the agency retain
 
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
general fund or does the agency retain
them

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
well that's an excellent question and
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's one that's
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
quite often not understood by
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
the by the legislature in general
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh the even the new members of our
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee now know more about
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and than about 90
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
of our colleagues because they don't
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
involvement with it as we as as we are
 
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:33.190 align:start position:0%
involvement with it as we as as we are
explaining

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
explaining
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
it to you here um so uh as a
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
as a general rule uh first of all the
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
the agency cannot just uh just decide to
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
implement a fine or a fee uh with no
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislative authority that that just
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
can't happen
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
um because it it's not legal
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh and the attorneys would that that
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
immediately come to the attention as it
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
did in the example i just gave about the
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
smoking ban so
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh so fees and fines are ordinarily
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh either the either the statute will
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
give the
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
agency the authority to set fees um
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
or it will retain that right for itself
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then it puts
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
the the the fee or the fine in the
 
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:22.870 align:start position:0%
the the the fee or the fine in the
statute

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
um but uh and it it and the the revenue
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's raised
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
by the fees and the fines is
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
essentially intended to to fund the cost
 
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.430 align:start position:0%
essentially intended to to fund the cost
of

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
the regulatory process for that
 
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.190 align:start position:0%
the regulatory process for that
particular

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh for that particular profession
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
so and most of the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
most the licensed professions in the
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
are overseen by a board so there's a
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
plumbing board the electrician's board
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
and most of these boards are what's
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
called 120
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
125 boards which means that they have to
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
raise 125 percent of the cost
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
of their operations so that
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fall on the taxpayers it
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
falls on the people who
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
either want to have a hunting license or
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
a plumber's license or an electrician's
 
00:54:24.559 --> 00:54:25.589 align:start position:0%
a plumber's license or an electrician's
license

00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the people pay for that
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
by in the cost of uh of their plumbing
 
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:33.829 align:start position:0%
by in the cost of uh of their plumbing
operation

00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
which goes to their plumber which as a
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
plumber has to have a license
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so forth it goes up the chain and
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
the 125 percent concept is in order to
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that that they don't have to
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
operate to the penny
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
because as you can imagine there's a
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
certain amount of ebb
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you're going off
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
track the
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
fines aren't fines not
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
sanctioned by statute are not the usual
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
reason for objecting to a rule
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
it happened no no i didn't i didn't say
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
that no i didn't say that
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
but you're answering the question as if
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
it were
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
the most usual case is that it exceeds
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative authority
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
and there's it and sometimes there's a
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
disagreement about what the legislation
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
intends right my question really though
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
is what happens you
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
let's say we write a law that says to to
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt's point
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
no smoking and the agency can
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
set whatever fines and then gelcar
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
approves a fine of fifty dollars
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
does that fine automatically go back to
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
the agency or does the statute have to
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
say where the money goes
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
by and large as i said the revenues that
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
are raised
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
are for the purpose of um enforcing the
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
law of course but also
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh in order to fund the cost of um
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
of the operations of the agency um
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
and as as i say the as i was saying
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
when carol interrupted uh to make her
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
point uh
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the the the the costs of the agency
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
are a steady a relatively steady cost
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
right they have
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
staff they have expenses and so forth
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
and the 125 fee
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
of uh the license fee for example uh
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
is intended to fund the cost of of the
 
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
is intended to fund the cost of of the
staff

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
and the oversight and the regulation and
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
and 25 percent is is to give
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
some uh some some play
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
some some slop if you will because
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes the costs are
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
are exceeded in a particular year um and
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the revenues
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that and that extra money flows over
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
into the general fund to get to the
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
point you're raising terry
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
um but we this is one of the problems
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
that was raised yesterday
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
by the director that some of the
 
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.230 align:start position:0%
by the director that some of the
agencies

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
are you know well above the 125 percent
 
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.630 align:start position:0%
are you know well above the 125 percent
fund

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh funding and that that is not the
 
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.390 align:start position:0%
uh funding and that that is not the
purpose

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh for making the agencies a cash cow
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
for the legislature
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and i think it's a
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
generally agreed to opinion
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
but the the the as i say there's some
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
good years and some linear
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
lean years for the agency the 25 is
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to cover that
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
so that they don't have to come back to
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
they just you know they have a little
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
bit of of
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
leeway and they and they use that in a
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
in a lean year
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
and in a good year that
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
excess revenue is supposed to flow over
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
into the general fund
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and that that's one of the things
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
is our committee has been very
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
conscientious about trying to
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune it so that we don't have
 
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.670 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune it so that we don't have
agencies

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
right right biggest problem i think
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know we've certainly given him soft
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
food but he doesn't really like canned
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
food so we use um
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
moist thank you um i
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing pam is anybody hearing me
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
at any time yes we hear you when we hear
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
pam too
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
but he seems good pam will have to mute
 
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.549 align:start position:0%
but he seems good pam will have to mute
herself

00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
herself
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
so um i attended a jail car hearing last
 
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
so um i attended a jail car hearing last
year

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
or well maybe it was in um 2019
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
and i noticed there were a lot of items
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
on a consent
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
calendar so my question was
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
how do things get on that consent
 
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.630 align:start position:0%
how do things get on that consent
calendar

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
versus having a hearing okay
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
i can answer that simple enough yes go
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
on representative schmidt
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay so so just like with legislation
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
if if the the attorneys look at a rule
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
and and it's there's no problem with it
 
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:13.190 align:start position:0%
and and it's there's no problem with it
whatsoever

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
then they put it on the consent calendar
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
now any member of gel car can pull
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
any item off the consent calendar but
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work every month and
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to have a second
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
meeting if that's if if our workload
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
requires it
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so we don't ordinarily pull off
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
rules that the attorneys have already
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
vetted and have found completely
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
compliant with
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh are the four pillars that carol
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
already explained and i
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
added some additional information too um
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar gets adopted with
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
one single
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
motion and one single vote by the jail
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
car when it comes up
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
when a rule comes in the attorneys will
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
look at look at it and they they'll they
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
might say of a certain provision
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
they talk with the agency and they say
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is going to cause
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
problems for the jail car you're not
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
going to get approval of this
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
and because the agency wants approval
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
they will rewrite the rule
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh to to comply with the
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
attorney's requests but there usually
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
comes a time
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
that the agency believes it has the
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
authority to do it this way
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
and it won't budge with regard to
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh that particular aspect and the
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys say
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
well we can't sign off on this
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
particular aspect only the gel car can
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
and those are the rules that go on the
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
regular calendar not on the consent
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
count if you go on the regular calendar
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a jalakar meeting and i strongly
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
recommend to
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
members of this committee because jail
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
car will be
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
referenced frequently almost constantly
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
with regard
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
to our the bills that we are dealing
 
01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
to our the bills that we are dealing
with

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
and it's good to you know tune in and
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
find out how the jail car works
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you do you'll be one of the rare
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
legislators whoever appeared before
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
then it happens the attorney when the
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
bill is when the rule is heard before
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
the jail car
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the attorney will say um
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
now look on page five rule
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph such and such and so and so um
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
and either it's a little too vague or
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's too rubber baggy uh
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
too too much leeway uh and
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the then the the
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
public will frequently object to this
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
that or what have you
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and the agents who will explain why
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
they've done it this way
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they say this is the only
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
way that we can do this
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
and we believe we have the authority to
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
do it and
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
they can adopt a rule over our final
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
objection only a joint resolution can
 
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.470 align:start position:0%
objection only a joint resolution can
stop

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
a particular paragraph from being
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
implemented while the legislature contin
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
considers that joint resolution but
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
so that that's basically it and then and
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
so frequently they
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
the attorneys will say well it's up to
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
the attorneys will say well it's up to
you

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
whether you want to prove this uh and
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
and this is the the attorneys have the
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
same objection to this rule 10 years ago
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
when it was first implemented and the
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
jail car approved it
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
but they bring it back to us because
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
again they can't sign off on some things
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
only the only the gel car can do it
 
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.230 align:start position:0%
only the only the gel car can do it
schuett

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you man um i wanted to point out i
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.950 align:start position:0%
thank you man um i wanted to point out i
believe

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
that i've heard that new hampshire
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
is the own or certainly one of very few
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
states that does take a legislative
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
oversight of rules that are implemented
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh by virtue of the laws that have been
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
passed is that
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
your understanding yes we are one of the
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
very few
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any other that does it
 
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.069 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any other that does it
specifically

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
in particular congress does not have any
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis thank you madam
 
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:31.829 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis thank you madam
chair

01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
um you had made a comment about uh
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
um providing you know some kind of
 
01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
um providing you know some kind of
oversight

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
over uh preventing bills with uh broad
 
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:42.230 align:start position:0%
over uh preventing bills with uh broad
room

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh we most bills that have
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
explicit rulemaking authority come to
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
edna as a second committee
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
so we will we will re see them there
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
re the invite the share and the vice
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
chair take a look at bills and other
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
committees that do not come to us
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
and have in some cases flag bills as
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
being incorrect by having broad rule
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get some sent to edna
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
others have been tabled or amended to
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of the
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking authority others
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes have been railroaded through
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you right
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
we when carol came into the legislature
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that she
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
noticed uh right off the bat
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
that that very often the older rules
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
would say
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
that com you know the agency shall write
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh rules to implement the statute
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
and it it'll say right in the bill
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see it
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh according to or to um 544
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
rsa 541a that is an open flag that it's
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
an administrative rules situation but
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
not every bill has that
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh so
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's the case uh then that will always
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
come to us
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't have it that
 
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.190 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't have it that
reference

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
um and so um
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
that what what we got rid of a lot of
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
stuff that that
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
where that broad rule making authority
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
was granted but in many cases the whole
 
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
was granted but in many cases the whole
structure

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
of the agency was built on this
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the statutory authority to write
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
rules to implement the statute
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
and if we'd if we'd remove that
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
provision there would have been no basis
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
for the whole
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
agency structure to handle that whole
 
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.430 align:start position:0%
agency structure to handle that whole
area

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the whole the thing would have
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
collapsed so we couldn't um
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
remove the authority there because it
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
had been in effect for years
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
and everything was dependent on it but
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
we don't let them do that anymore
 
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.109 align:start position:0%
we don't let them do that anymore
because

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
because it it's way too loose the agency
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't really like to do that they
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
would much rather have the authority of
 
01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.430 align:start position:0%
would much rather have the authority of
the

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to do x y or z that's
 
01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:12.789 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to do x y or z that's
why

01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
now fees and fines are ordinarily
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
included in statutes right
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
and in fact one of the projects we did
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
in uh 11 was to repeal
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
a good number of broad rulemaking
 
01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:28.069 align:start position:0%
a good number of broad rulemaking
authority

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
and replace it with specific rulemaking
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
authority where needed uh
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
one one key point was that the entire
 
01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
one one key point was that the entire
medicaid

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
program was being run under the
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dhs hss's
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking authority to implement
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the chapter and so now
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
that was changed and we now specifies
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
they can come up with
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
cri the requirements to be on medicaid
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
how they determine payments and things
 
01:06:59.760 --> 01:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
how they determine payments and things
like

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
that so it is much much more tightly
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
right if i could just say one thing that
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that is um that when i
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
came on the gel car
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
14 15 years ago um that we had
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
lots of rules that had expired lots of
 
01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
lots of rules that had expired lots of
rules

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
some of them had been expired for years
 
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
some of them had been expired for years
um

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the agency was continuing to run
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
their shop
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
based on these expired rules uh although
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
there actually was
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
a court decision uh that
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that had already happened at the time i
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
came on
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
that said uh you know that expired rules
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
were not rules
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
they had no authority the agency could
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
not implement that
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so there was a big push to to clean
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
up all those expired rules most of them
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
worked on by the time carroll came onto
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
the jail car several years later
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and now we rarely have rules that uh
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
that have expired more than
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of weeks or a month or
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
so because they
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're working on them they just
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
haven't got them done because it is
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
very very time consuming to write rules
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
the bigger agencies like hhs or des
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
or safety they have a rules writing unit
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
they have a rules writing coordinator
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
specialist attorneys who you know who
 
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.630 align:start position:0%
specialist attorneys who you know who
and

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
agency members who are very
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable who are constantly working
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
on rules
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
but the smaller agencies the little
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
departments very often don't have a
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
rules unit
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so they were the ones who were most
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
remiss as the general rule
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
now we rarely find or not frequently
 
01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.030 align:start position:0%
now we rarely find or not frequently
anyway

01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
expired rules um
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
but um so a lot of things have been
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
tightened up because
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
when carol came on uh and became the
 
01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.349 align:start position:0%
when carol came on uh and became the
chair

01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh that was one of the things that she
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
was especially you know dedicated to
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the rules and we've
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
gotten much tighter in the meantime
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
schmidt are there any other questions or
 
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.789 align:start position:0%
schmidt are there any other questions or
comments

01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
well in that case i would suggest we
 
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:22.709 align:start position:0%
well in that case i would suggest we
adjourn

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
adjourn
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
we will not be having any full committee
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
meetings next week
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh pam do you ever have something to add
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
no i was just coming on to see if there
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
was anything
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
i i you know you might ask or or say i i
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
did send an email to
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
to everybody a few minutes ago with the
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
the full list of the nine bills that you
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
identified at the outset
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the meeting and um that will uh
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
that will let us get a head up yes
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair will it be
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
possible at one time
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
um to get a list of all the bills that
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hear
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes you've go you go to the advanced
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill search and go in by committee
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay there were 49 the last i checked
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes oh good okay
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
um i really hope this doesn't come
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
across as partisan because i mean this
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
is a very nonpartisan point
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate that we have had
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
these meetings over zoom
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and want to point out to or kindly
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
suggest to anyone who
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
has had trouble with zoom to seek
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
help from those of us who can help
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot or lend equipment
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
or like i have an extra wi-fi rider uh
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
router that i'd be willing to give to
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative scitec if that would help
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
his technological issues
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i i think um i may be hyper aware of
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
these issues because of my own
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
susceptibility to um
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
illness with milder flus
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
so i really appreciate that we've had
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
these in zoom
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
over zoom and i just am trying to make
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
the point that hopefully we can over the
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
next week work out any of our
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
technological issues
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
so we can continue to have this as our
 
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.630 align:start position:0%
so we can continue to have this as our
platform

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh that's very kind of
 
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh that's very kind of
you

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
and the decision is above my pay grade
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%

remote or hybrid meetings
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
um i think at the moment they're leaning
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
toward remote
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
