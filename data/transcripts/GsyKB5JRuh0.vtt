00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chair um and I
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate all my bills being scheduled
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
for one day so you guys have to deal
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
with me all day but uh hopefully by the
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
end day learn some more about the
 
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
criminal justice process um so by way of
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
background I'm a criminal defense lawyer
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything I do is DWI
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
defense and this first bill relates to
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
body warant cameras body Waring cameras
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
are great um when I first started
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
practicing law more than 15 years ago
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much no departments had that um
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
since then I would say that has
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
increased by over a th% State Police use
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
them um I think rough I I think more
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
than half of the Town departments do use
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
them in some form um so they're great um
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
they're great for police if someone
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
makes a false accusation someone can
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
look at the video see what happens if
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
someone alleges um excessive force
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
someone can look at the video see what
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
happens it's always good for defendants
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that police reports and police
 
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
testimony aligns with what actually
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
happened um overall helps public
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
confidence um the public can see these
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
videos um and address it and uh just
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
coming forward a little bit um I think
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with the president's
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
statute is what happens to that video um
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
so my um Bill makes it that the
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
defendant is entitled to copy share that
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
video um I suggest there's a public
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
interest in um body warn camera videos
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
um so across the country in the last few
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
years there's been instances of
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
excessive police force to say a minimum
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times those things have
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
been put on camera um they've been
 
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
spread on YouTube um and ultimately it
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
leaves to leads to what I would suggest
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
suggest is the most Fair outcome of
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
those cases um if there weren't video in
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
those cases I would suggest that the uh
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
outcome might often be different so is
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
important for not just the defendant um
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
but public as a society to have access
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
to these body warn camera videos and
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the president statute
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
limits that um so my bill is addressing
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
or looking to address that um first some
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
departments take the position that the
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
statute as presently written
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
um doesn't really provide defense
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
lawyers or the defendant with um access
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
to that video I think that's a wrong
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
reading of the statute um but even if
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
the statute did say hey defendant can't
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
have this video statute would be
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
patently unconstitutional um under state
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
constitution defendants have a right to
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
all proofs favorable certainly that
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
includes exculpatory evidence certainly
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
includes body warant camera video um so
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the defendant has the right to those
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
videos um in certain instances um there
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
could be privacy issues um where perhaps
 
00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
the state might want to redact it um um
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
I can think of cases where um there
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
might be nudity involved so I it's
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the state to redact
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
certain portions where necessary um and
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
the state can get protective orders to
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
do that so before they release the video
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
they can tell the judge hey we want to
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
limit this part of the video and
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully the defense has an opportunity
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
to be heard because one option is what's
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
called an in camera review hearing U so
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
a judge can look at the evidence if they
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
want to say all right fine don't provide
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
this or provide this or issue some type
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
of order so it's clear what should be
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
released to the defendant um so that's
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
one part of my bill it just says the
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
defendant is entitled to this footage um
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
another part of the bill is that um the
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
evidence shouldn't be destroyed um in
 
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
criminal cases so um I think the present
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
statute kind of is ambiguous in that
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
regard uh where it deals with time
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
frames for Destruction um another part
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
does say that it um shouldn't really be
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
destroyed while cases are pending uh one
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
potential issue is even if a case is
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
over it's not completely over over so
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
there can be post-trial relief motions
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
um so two that come to mind if someone
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
wants a new trial um one could be for an
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
effective assistance of council that's
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
where their original lawyer did
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
something wrong um and the court will
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
have to look at all the evidence and
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
decide whether it rises to that um and
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
without having that video in a lot of
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
these cases it's not really possible to
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
look at that um I could foresee a case
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
where let's just say the lawyer said nah
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
the video was a couple hours long I
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
don't really want to sit through it and
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
watch that video like well we don't know
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
what's on the video If you destroyed it
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
so um I think at a minimum the defendant
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
should be able to retain that video for
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
all they want for as long as they want I
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
think the defendant is entitled to share
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
that video in the way they want with
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
certain exceptions again if there's
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
privacy issues again a protective order
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
a case-by casee basis can deal with that
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
um the other part of this bill that um
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
repeals the part where officers can only
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
use body warant camera videos while
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
they're in uniform um I think generally
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
police probably do want to only use it
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
while in uniform I gu think of there
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
might be cases where they might not so
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
if there's an undercover officer who
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
worked on a case for a while maybe he's
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
involved with the executing a search
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
warrant after the fact perhaps he wants
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
to put a body warrant camera video on um
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone's off duty an officer he
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
has one with him um so I don't know how
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
common it will be but I don't think we
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
should be prohibiting the police just
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
100% saying you can never have officers
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
use these videos unless they um are in
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know form so this would just allow
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
them uh the department if they want to
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
do it in certain cases and the other
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
important part of this um my bill which
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
I think is one of the most important
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
parts is that it stops police from
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
turning off the videos while they're
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
speaking with other police I don't know
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
why that was put in the original statute
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
but there is a major problem with it um
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
also um I used to be a member of New
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association criminal defense
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
lers um it's my understanding they sent
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
an email with some possible amendments
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully to the entire committee I did
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
see it got sent to the chair
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so my part of the bill just repeals
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
that section altogether because officers
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
once they turn on that video they should
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
not turn off that video uh what happens
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
in DWI cases I've seen it numerous times
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um one particular agency tends to do it
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
more than the others um but they're
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
doing their investigation like they
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
should um it's usually after the point
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
field sobriety tests are done um at that
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
point in most cases after field soety
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
tests some officers will offer a
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
portable breath task but if they don't
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
do that at that point it's the decision
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
time for the officer am I going to
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
arrest this person for DWI or am I going
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
to let him go and a lot of newer
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
officers um or even other officers
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
consult with other officers before they
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
make that decision so I have cases where
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
the field Sprite tests are done the
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
officer goes speaks with another officer
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
mutes his microphone comes back and
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
arrests um I only get the cases where
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
someone arrests I'm sure somewhere out
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
there there's other cases where the
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
person doesn't get arrested I only get
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
the arrest cases
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I after the case I see like why is I
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
see the video being muted I'm like what
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
happened to this um I originally didn't
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
know that the statute presently
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
prohibits that and I just think that's
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely ridiculous uh but whenever I
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
asked the officer well what happened
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
during that conversation either they
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't recall or a lot of times it was
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
related to something other than the
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
actual case I think it's ridiculous that
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
an officer in the middle right before
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
they make an arrest is going to start
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
speaking about another case um so
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately potentially exculpatory
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
evidence is destroyed when that video is
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
muted um if there are privacy concerns
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
they can redact it after the fact they
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
should not be eliminating the video in
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the first place because we do not know
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
what happens and I think I know what
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
happens I think they're talking about
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
the case they might say well this is a
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
close case I don't know if I were going
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
to arrest and one supervising Officer
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
says just arrest see if he gives a
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
breath test back at the station um so
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
without that video we just don't know
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
what happens um so those are three
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
things my bill does um it's my
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
um NH HAC CDL has proposed some
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment language and i would support
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
their language um it looks like they're
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
doing the three same things as I am
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do um just in a slightly
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
different way um so I'm fine with their
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
language if um committee wants to do
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
that and I believe someone from their
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
organization might be here testify to
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
that um so you can ask them questions
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
about it but I would support their
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
language does the three things that I'm
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
looking to do and I'm happy to take any
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative of I
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
I don't have a question I just need to
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
repeat one thing if you could for me I
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
was trying to write it down so it was
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
after you had talked about uh the
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
portions that would be able to be
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
redacted if needed to be and then so it
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
was after that and before you had talked
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
about uh you wanting for to prevent
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
police from being able to turn it off if
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
they were having a conversation could
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
you just say what was between those two
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't able to write it
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
down I I saw that you were looking at
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
your computer so I thought you probably
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
had it written I'm sorry I spot it's
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay if you don't have yeah I don't
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
recall what was between those sorry
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's okay no problem okay does anybody
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
um can you think of any
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
situations um maybe like a noteworthy
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
case or something that would have
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
benefited from the defendant having
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
access to this evidence against them
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
like are there any
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
examples of when this would have
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
been useful yeah so I think the
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
defendant is entitled to these body
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
warant cameras as just under the
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution the issue is some
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
departments want to go get court orders
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
to provide it um that slows down the
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
process which is just bad in that it's
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
slowing down Court processes and
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
delaying trials but it's also bad for
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
the defendant um they have these things
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
hanging over their head um more often
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
than not they're already under
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
suspension for um imply consent so
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
having them resolve these cases as quick
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
as possible is just favor favorable to
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
them um and I'll also add that um after
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill I saw that the Senate
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
filed a version of this bill I think
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's issues with that bill uh I think
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
it might potentially cause more harm
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
than it's trying to fix so I think the
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
underlying thing that it's trying to do
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
is the same thing allowing defendants to
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
get access to it I think the concern I
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
have with it is saying that one
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
defendants can't
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
essentially copy it or get
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative sorry that's okay if we
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
could just please stick to what your
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
bill does and when that Bill gets here
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
we you can come testify that one and let
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
us hear that but let's stick with this
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
one thank you thank
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah one one quick question I'm
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
just curious if you have run into any of
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
the issues you've identified today as an
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
attorney in your
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
practice it tends to be uh just one or
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
two departments that kind of want to get
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
judicial um permission to um give it um
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
but the muting yes I get that all the
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
time one in the Departments who's
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
here almost every single well I don't
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
say every single case often when there
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
when there's a officer speaking with
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
another officer they are muting that
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
case it's common if there's two officers
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
involved and I asked and they said hey
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
we have to statute says so uh other
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
departments I guess don't really follow
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
that part of the statute because I do
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
see officer speaking with other officers
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that one is very
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
common um the releasing to the defendant
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
presently I think it's less of a problem
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
but it it can cause delays when it is a
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
fixed any further questions from the
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
Captain

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for your
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
time I'm here to represent the New
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety Division
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
of State Police in opposition to this
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
bill and the reasons therefore um amount
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
to the following arguments uh defendants
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases are are in fact
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
entitled to copies of their video
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
because it's a constitutional right that
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to confront the
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
evidence against them and mount a
 
00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.309 align:start position:0%
evidence against them and mount a
reasonable

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
defense uh the State Police in our
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
stance on on body warn camera videos
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's pretty scrupulous we' like to have
 
00:16:58.829 --> 00:16:58.839 align:start position:0%
a continuous record of the entire cont
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
from the point that it begins until the
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
point that it's over with um in the
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
midst of that uh recording there are
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
times where we will mute the reasons for
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
muting um very often do occur within the
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
context of conversations with other law
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers other Troopers and
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
those conversations are both tactical
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
where we discuss investigatory technique
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
or approach and uh in in other cases
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
they're tactical in terms of their of uh
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
their safety decisions about who will
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
move where when and why and therefore
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
there are aspects of those conversations
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
that really ought not be released to the
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
public because they reveal tactics to
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
help to keep us and the citizens that we
 
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.549 align:start position:0%
help to keep us and the citizens that we
serve

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.270 align:start position:0%
serve
safe

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
um to allow the the sharing of footage
 
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.669 align:start position:0%
um to allow the the sharing of footage
by

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
defendants is a dangerous thing uh for a
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
person to mount a defense is obviously
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
baked right into their constitutional
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
rights and ought to be scrupulously
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
therefore uh defended and maintained by
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but to share a video
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
without there being automatically within
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
the court process a protective order on
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
said video so that its use is strictly
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
for the mounting of said defense is to
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh create what are secondary effects
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
whereby defendants will release video
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
that violates other people's privacy um
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
whether that's third parties victims and
 
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.870 align:start position:0%
whether that's third parties victims and
Witnesses

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
and um to to put things in the media
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
before uh they're held they're held to
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
scrutiny in a court of law is really to
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
risk Fair trial for the very person
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
charged uh in cases where they are
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
charged the um with regard to
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence uh what is material
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
and relevant and is on video is saved
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
our policy saves our video for a hundred
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
years if we classify it as a demeanor or
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
felony arrest automatically and that's
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the way that the system
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
works uh my grandkids May someday see
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
video of of a car stop I made yesterday
 
00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:12.390 align:start position:0%
video of of a car stop I made yesterday
so

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
um with regard to uh officers shall only
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
use body warn cameras while in uniform
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
the repeal of 105d uh to Roman 4
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that a member of the
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
drug task force for example upon the
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
execution of a search warrant will be
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
wearing police Insignia and is therefore
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
in some form of uniform we do have our
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
detectives on occasion put these things
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
on uh tripods in rooms for the sake of
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
being careful to record their interviews
 
00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:47.710 align:start position:0%
being careful to record their interviews
with

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
with
suspects

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
suspects
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
um the uh the other issue as you can see
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
with with my uniform Here Is We I had to
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
cut a hole well we had to cut holes in
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
all of our uniforms which is a great way
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
for a body War camera manufacturer to
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that we stick with them we 87
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
years of this uniform and now there's a
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
hole in it so um to expect anyone in
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
plain clothes capacity to to do the same
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
with their clothing I would obviously
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
argue is a pretty Preposterous outcome
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh that may not be the intent of of that
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
repal but uh the fact of the matter is
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
that our people who are not in uniform
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
do at times use use these devices though
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
they're not technically mounted to their
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
bodies they also do have outer garments
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
um our outer garments our rain jackets
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
our cold weather jackets they have these
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
holes and grommets in them as well and
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
so if they wanted to wear it then they
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
could throw that on and they could still
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
use it um within the context allowable
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
by law so uh lastly the repeal of 105 D2
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh 7A Communications with with other
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
police Personnel obviously muting is the
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
issue we maintain a continuous record uh
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
visibly and don't shut down the
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
recording that's something that I when I
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
when I designed the training for all of
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
our Troopers made sure that they were
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
aware of it's far better to have a
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
continuous record um we're big fans of
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
these as well because they do in fact
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
reveal a great deal about what the
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
nature of the interaction was the
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
professionalism of of the law
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer uh the attitude and
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
response of the defendant and uh are
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
just as likely to uh inculpate as
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
exculpate and therefore they're very
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
useful uh both for for our uh our
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
responsiveness to the public our
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
accountability and the same for the
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
defendant uh notwithstanding that the
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
law as written is clearly written in
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
such a way that that wasn't necessarily
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
its intent um it's it is very useful to
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
watch a person pour him or herself out
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh on the actual event as
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to seeing a person who is
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
collected and well dressed and
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
well-mannered uh in a courtroom they
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
paint very very different pictures and
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
they ought so that will conclude my
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I appreciate your time thank
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
you Captain a few questions for myself
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee um with regard to the muting
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
aspect for the benefit of the committee
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
so to kind of paint a picture what that
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
might entail for example if you were
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
conducting a motor vehicle search and
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
the search was based on information from
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
a confidential
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
informant and one of the officers says
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the other officer where did X say it
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
would be exactly
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
again would that be problematic if that
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
video audio were released to the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
defendant and allowed to be shared yes
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
sir can you explain um another potential
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
issue let us understand what that means
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
like the conversation part of it yes sir
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh in in many of these conversations not
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
only do we talk about tactics okay well
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know this guy right you you've
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
stopped him a handful of times yeah and
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like me a bit so I would much
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
rather if uh you take point on this and
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just be in the background I'll
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
support uh things of that nature that
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
would in my in the opinion of the State
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh State Police would make issues out of
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
non-issues which are just personality in
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
some cases um potentially inflame the
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
the uh process of audification or or uh
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
create problems that aren't that aren't
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
really necessarily there there are also
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
issues of um their their ties to their
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
associations with other persons their
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
criminal records uh a lot of
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
intelligence information yeah he pulled
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
out a 238 Smith Street and we all know
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's a flop house that's a that's a
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
crack house uh whatever that might be in
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the case of ongoing
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
investigations um we could compromise a
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
lot of information that way so it's
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
really for that reason that that we mute
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
those and from the other
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
aspect the defendant um you say you keep
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
the tapes for a 100 years but if it's
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
not on the audio it's not there so the
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
defendant doesn't even have an
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um have a judge look at
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
it or listen to it in camera to see if
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's relevant to his case would it not
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
be possible for for you to go back and
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
and mute retroactively if a if a tape
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
was produced yes sir it is possible so
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the original recording itself that
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
data file either has the audio or it
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't if we mute then it does not if
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
it does have the audio file for example
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh you see it on on Cops sometimes
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see people speaking to a police
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
officer and they'll ask them where
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
they're going or what their date of
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
birth is you see their lips move but you
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't hear anything it may actually have
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
been recorded in the original uh file
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
but was uh redacted so that someone's
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
birth date or address isn't divulged on
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
National Television thank you yes sir um
 
00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:54.630 align:start position:0%
National Television thank you yes sir um
representative

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
Newman I believe uh in your testimony at
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
some point you mentioned that a
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
requirement for the body to be in full
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
uniform when using the body One camera
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that in the bill or is that in one of
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
the one of the things that have been
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
removed where where exactly is that yes
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
sir uh the controlling statute RSA 105
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh- D colon 2 in section uh four uh
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
Roman four reads officer shall only use
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
bwc's while in uniform it doesn't State
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
what level of uni or what constitutes a
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
uniform it just says they they should
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
only use them while in uniform and uh a
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
clear provision there is for undercover
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
officers it would be pretty Preposterous
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
for someone to be drying buying drugs
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
with a the body warn camera on uh in the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
midst of an investigation so that's
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
where the that's where that statement
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
exists currently in RSA 105 D2 officers
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
shall uh only use bwc's while in uniform
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
and this proposed legislation repeals
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
that okay so so if it is not repealed
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's far sorry follow yeah go ahead so
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
if this law is taken out yes sir that
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
requirement to be in full uniform will
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
not be there is that the correct
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
understanding uh and sir I'll I'll just
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
bring you back to the language itself
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
officers shall only use bwc's while in
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
uniform so you've used the word full the
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
term full uniform a couple of times
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
that's not what the statute says it says
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we shall only use these while in
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
uniform when in uniform okay yes sir
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative sing thank you
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you sir for your
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm curious and as the
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
parent of a 16-year-old driver probably
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
extra curious um when you when state
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
officers make a traffic stop uh what
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
point does the camera get turned on and
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
at what point does it get turned off
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
great questions our system is automated
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
such that if my light bar is on the
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
moment I open my door there's a sensor
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
that activates my body warn camera it
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
will tell me so it stays AC activated
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
until I do something to either mute it
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
or to shut it off uh in my practice of
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
car stops and the way that I trained
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in the State Police to do it it
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
should be a continuous record it
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
accounts for the entire uh the entire
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
contact even moments where we're back in
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
the car so it's very common for me to
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
come back to my cruiser and mute radio
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
traffic other people's dates of birth
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
Etc being spoken over the radio uh to
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
unmute make my second contact let them
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
know what the determination is as far as
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement action back to the cruiser
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
they pull away and then I'll shut down
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
both my body Warn and my cruiser camera
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
ma'am um representative Bolton
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
um I think it's probably a little
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
similar to what the chairman was asking
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
about but if you're
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
muting portions of a recording are you
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
not essentially redacting in real time
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
and could that not then be done ret
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
retroactively upon a request of a
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
recording and and I guess generally my
 
00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.389 align:start position:0%
recording and and I guess generally my
question

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
is if you're already in a position to
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
control for privacy
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
violations why then oppose the
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
legislation um it's a matter of scope of
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
work when I uh to answer your question
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh affirmatively and proactively
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
redact uh an aspect of a recording on
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
the side of the road I am preventing the
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
release of what I expect to be
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
information that I would have to go and
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
redact upon review of the video um we
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
were 80 Troopers down out of our
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
compliment of 350 or so until a month
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
ago or we're 70 down now uh and a few
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
more to leave the notion of spending yet
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
more time in the office or uh off the
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
road not being out serving the public
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
and revie viewing all of that video to
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that those things are not in
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
there when uh by alternatively by
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
practice we could be sure that those
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
things weren't in there we we take the
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
approach of of doing it
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
proactively so I would I would I would
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
argue that um to have to go through all
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
that in terms of that much more material
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
for redaction we we'd need to hire more
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
people to have them to have them help
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
with that and we only have three now
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
follow up I suppose my follow-up
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
question was only uh do you feel there
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
should be a fiscal note attached to
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
this in the case of of uh should it
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
should it Advance further yes
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am Captain if um if you if you have
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
any idea about how many Motor Vehicles
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
stops that are recorded occur uh per
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
year uh it's it's thousands uh even as a
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
as a captain I I make many uh as a
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
sergeant I made more than a thousand a
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
year year we have a number of Troopers
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
who do that so we're within the first uh
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
within the first six months we had
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
several terabytes worth of data and uh a
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
gig of data which is a thousands of a of
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
a terabyte is an hour worth of video at
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
720p which is our our level so it's tens
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
of thousands without question so even
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
let's say um let's say it was 30,000
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
stops a year and only 10% of those went
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
to court and it was required you'd still
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
be required to go through 3,000 videos
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
and listen to the entire thing to redact
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
things that may need to be redacted
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
would that be accurate yes sir good
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um any further questions from
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
the committee of the
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
captain seeing none thank you for your
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
halberton

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
M good morning members of the committee
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Stephen Andress I'm an
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney in the Marat
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
County Attorney's Office I've been a
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years now and
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
with me is attorney Halverson who is the
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
marac County Attorney he's also been a
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for around 20 years um we
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill essentially when you
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 105 D2 which is the body
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
warn camera statute it's a fairly
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive statute it was a
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort through a number of
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders came together to write that
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
language when you look at that statute
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
it can essentially be broken down into
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
two broad sections the first section
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
involves the creation of bodyw warn
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
cameras by law enforcement in the field
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the second section deals with
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
handling of the bodyw warn camera
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
recordings once they're
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
created that second section about
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
handling um includes a Prohibition on
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
copying altering or Distributing the
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
video it talks about guidelines for
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
access to the video it talks about
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines for storage of the video and
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
it talks about requirements relative to
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
destruction and retention of the video
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
and again there were a number of factors
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
that the legislature considered when
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
writing those
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines um in addition to police
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
accountability there was a a major
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
concern about privacy and privacy in
 
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.590 align:start position:0%
concern about privacy and privacy in
those

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
videos the current statute RSA 105 D2 I
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
believe it's section 12 has a provision
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
which says these videos shall not be
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
copied and that creates some tension in
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system because
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
obviously defense attorneys want to copy
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
of that video we've taken the position
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we can provide access to it in the
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
sense that you can come watch it we can
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
send you a link so you can watch it but
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily want to give you a
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
copy of the video that's something that
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
we've litigated a number of times most
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
of those um cases have ended up in the
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
court ordering us to provide a copy of
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
the video to defense um the the court
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
has taken the pro position that within
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
the statute it says except as authorized
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
in this section and while it's not
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
explicitly authorized in 105 D2 implicit
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
within that statute is a belief that it
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
will be provided to the defense for
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
Discovery most of the cases that we've
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
had the judges have said however it
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
should be under an appropriate
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
protective order and we've certainly
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
litigated um the parameters of what that
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
protective order looks like I think that
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good first step in the
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
sense that it makes it clear that these
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
videos can be provided to the defense in
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
a case but it doesn't go far enough in
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
terms of a protective order one one of
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
the first things I noticed when reading
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
this language is it talks about a
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
defendant in a criminal case it
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
overlooks juvenile cases and it
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
overlooks Administrative Hearings I
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
think that if you were to craft language
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
that says a defendant in a criminal case
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
is entitled to a body warn camera then
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a juvenile and a juvenile
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
delinquency hearing is entitled to bodyw
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
warn cameras and certainly in an
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing like a li an
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
hearing the respondent should be able to
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
access their body warant camera as
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
well the bill talks about the defense
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
being able to uh obtain a copy of the
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
footage but it doesn't talk about how
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
the prosecution can obtain a copy I
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
think it should be made clear that the
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
police can make a copy for the defense
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
the police can make a copy for the
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
prosecution both parties to the criminal
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
case have equal
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
access what concerns me is it allows the
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
defense to copy share and display the
 
00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.589 align:start position:0%
defense to copy share and display the
data

00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
data I think there needs to be language
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
within the statute that um has some
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
protections on that data once it's
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
provided to the defense attorney and
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
again there's already language in 105d
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
to that creates protections um when the
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
police possess the data for example the
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
police can only access these videos for
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement purposes there can't be
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
a situation where the police are you
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
know someone says oh I stopped this car
 
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
last night you wouldn't believe what
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
happened and and a bunch of officers
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
gather around a computer and and watch a
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
video sort of at the expense of the
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
defendant or laughing at the defendant
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
under the current statute that can't
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
happen these videos have to be securely
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
stored in compliance with the FBI's cgis
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines because there was a concern
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
about these videos essentially getting
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
out or being leaked or hacked from the
 
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.910 align:start position:0%
out or being leaked or hacked from the
police

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
department and I I think it it's worth
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
talking about what is actually on a body
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
warn camera video and I can give you an
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
example we recently had a case for a
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
driving well intoxicated case small
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
Department car went off the road into a
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh a utility pole so one officer shows
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
up on scene there's an hour and a half
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
of video when that officer shows up on
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
scene there's nobody there except for
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
some volunteer firefighters so the first
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
part of this body warn camera video is
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
the officer talking to volunteer
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters looking at the
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
scene a motorist stops and says hey I
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
was driving by and this is what I saw I
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
saw two guys get into a pickup truck it
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
was a red truck it went in that
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
direction so they get that individual's
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
name date of burf his
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
address uh they run the license plate of
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to try and figure out who's
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
involved in this and it comes back that
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
the the the truck is registered to an
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
individual who's in their early 20s so
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
the police off officer and some of the
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters have a discussion
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
about well who lives in the area who has
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
kids about that age that maybe they were
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
going to visit you know maybe somebody
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
knows something eventually the driver a
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
passenger who is in the vehicle and
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
another neighbor show up back on scene
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
and the officer speaks to each of those
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
individuals separately again we get each
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
individual's name date of birth their
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
address sort of their involvement in
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
and and you wonder when we talk about um
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the state may seek a protective order
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
from the court to
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
prevent dissemination of body wearing
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
camera footage when it implicates an
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
individual's right to
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
privacy you think well that case I just
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
described are there rights to privacy in
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
there in my opinion there are I think
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
that those neighbors who come down and
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
talk to the police and say hey this is
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
what I saw I think they have a right to
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
privacy and perhaps a right to not have
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
that footage put on YouTube by the
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
defendant I think that you know maybe
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
the passenger in the car whose head is
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
gashed open and is bleeding down his
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
face has a right to not have the
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
defendant have that video and be able to
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
put that on YouTube or or disseminate
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
it another recent case we had which sort
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
of brings this point home is we had a
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
case where the New Hampshire State
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
Police Stopped a car on 90 3 there were
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
three individuals in the car and each of
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
those three individuals ended up being
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
arrested the one of the individuals was
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
arrested on an outstanding warrant that
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
individual gave a false name eventually
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
the police were able to figure out who
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
she was arrested her on the
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
warrant when she's arrested on the
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
warrant she's crying she says I'm scared
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
I'm on drugs I'm afraid to go to jail um
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
she also talks about the fact that they
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
were actually going to buy drugs she
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
tells the trooper there's there's no
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
drugs in the vehicle but the other two
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
guys in the car have drugs on
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
them um the police end up searching one
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
of the the driver with consent he's
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
arrested for possession of a controlled
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
drug the other
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
individual um denies consent he's
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
actually seized brought to the New
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police Barracks where
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
they apply for a search warrant to
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
search his person based on the fact that
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
they know he has drugs on his
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
person eventually they get that warrant
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
they search him he's then arrested he's
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
transported to the jail and booked um
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
earlier the next
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
morning I was surprised because we we
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
litigated this about the body warn
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
camera there were 13 hours and 40
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
minutes of video for that
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
stop so almost 14 hours of video because
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
a number of Troopers showed up so he had
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing from a number of points
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
of view
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
um we had both body warn camera and
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
Cruiser camera so we have almost 14
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
hours of video and now I have to look at
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
those 14 hours of video and decide
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not that implicates an
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
individual's right to
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
privacy well it certainly strikes me
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
that I have to provide the video to each
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
of those defendants but do I have to
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
provide the video of the woman who's
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
crying about having a drug problem to
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
the rear seat passenger in that
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
car I mean I think she has a privacy
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
interest in that interestingly when the
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
police were conducting the search
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
warrant they ask the individual if he
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
has anything in his pants and he drops
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
his pants he also drops his underwear
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's all captured on the body warant
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
camera video well certainly he has a
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
right to privacy in his exposed
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
genitalia but do I have to then provide
 
00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I think when we we're looking at body
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
Waring cameras it's it's more than just
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
the police interacting with the
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
defendant it's the police interacting
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the public it's the police
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
interacting with Witnesses it's the
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
police interacting with people that are
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
having Mental Health crisis it's the
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
police interacting with people that are
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
having medical crisis it's the police
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
interacting with intoxicated people and
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
those people have a right to privacy and
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
have a right not to have the defendant
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
put these videos on
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube so I think that clarifying that
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
the defendant has a right to possess
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
this footage is great I think it's a
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
good first step the problem is that we
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
need to go further and we need to put
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
privacy protections on this material to
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
say that the defense can't distribute it
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
they can't copy it it's my opinion that
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the close of the case the defense
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
should have to destroy any copies that
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
they have I don't see why they have the
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
ability to retain it and when I look at
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
other types of cases we do that for
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
example if you have a case with child
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images or a violation of
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
privacy case where someone hides a
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
camera in a locker room and has a video
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
of a bunch of people changing we don't
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
give that out as Discovery to the
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
defendant we say if you want to see it
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
make an appointment come to the police
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
station come to the prosecutor's office
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
you can watch it as much as you want
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to give you a copy
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
of it and to the extent someone says
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
well I need a copy of it to prepare my
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
case we're going to go before the court
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
and say okay fine they can have a copy
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
of it but there needs to be restrictions
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
on that copy they can't further copy it
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
and they have to destroy it at the end
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
of the case because it would make no
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
sense for you to be able to hide a
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
camera in a locker room videotape
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
someone changing and then as part of
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
Discovery get a copy of that be able to
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
own it
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
forever um
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
as attorney Hines representative Hines
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is a Senate bill
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
which um I think does address those
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
those concerns additionally when we talk
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
about this the language about officers
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
being in uniform with body warn camera
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
to me the reason that language is there
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
is because we want it to be perfectly
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
clear to members of the public and
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
Witnesses they are talking to a police
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
officer we don't want any confusion
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
with the fact I'm talking to the police
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is being recorded this is being um
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
memorialized so I think it is important
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
to to leave that in there and I support
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
Captain Davy's statement with reference
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
officers if you made it so that you
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to have private
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
conversations what would happen is the
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
police would be making gestures to each
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
other or communicating in non-verbal
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
ways to you
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
know what do I do here do you think do
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
you think we arrest this guy certainly
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
um we know that those are conversations
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
between supervisors and and other
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
officers about what do you think I
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
should do let's do this let's do that
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
and they do have a right to privacy in
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
those conversations because if you took
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
away the right to privacy they just
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have those conversations it's
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
not that it would be recorded it's that
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
those conversations wouldn't occur and I
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
think it's important that those
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
conversations do occur with law
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the in the field I don't
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
know if you have anything to
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
add attorney Andress mentioned um uh a
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that was out there he also
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the tension that exists
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
between having these materials and
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
getting them to defense Council I can
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
tell you that um uh in talking and And
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
discussing the the issue with the Senate
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
side of the house um I had either direct
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
personal conversation face Toof face
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
with members of the ACLU or by telephone
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
both with them uh with criminal defense
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh with senior leadership over
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
at the public defender office to craft
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that does virtually everything
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill before you does in the
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
Senate uh and I think that that
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort Builds on a
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort that established
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
statute and um I don't want to get too
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
in too in depth with uh the other with
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill unless there's questions
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
about it I'll certainly mention it but
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
um right um but uh uh other than
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
mentioning the collaborative effort in
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
the other side um we are not blind to
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that defense that defendants
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
need access to this to this material we
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that um but the
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
original bill was written so tightly
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
that it gave no flexibility it gives no
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the original bill for
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
creating an exhibit for
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
court which is surprising uh because you
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
can't copy it or edit it um we've been
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
having to do um to do all of our items
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
via court order uh and Via litigation uh
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
and it's tied up a a good amount of
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
court time uh on the court time side of
 
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
things uh the bill before you talks
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
about um establishing a court order for
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
privacy that may involve asking a judge
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
to do an in camera review view an in
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
office review of the body warn camera
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
material using the two examples attorney
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
Andress mentioned you'd have 14 hours
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
worth of video that a judge would have
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
to look at to determine whether or not a
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
privacy interest existed um and uh I
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's a good use of court
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
time uh I think it's can be addressed by
 
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.950 align:start position:0%
time uh I think it's can be addressed by
other

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.549 align:start position:0%
other
legislative

00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
actions and other than that I'll defer
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
to uh attorney Enders as ain't follow up
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
to me and I'll gladly answer any
 
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.510 align:start position:0%
to me and I'll gladly answer any
question

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions um thank you right off the cop
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
of my head I I have concern do you think
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
that allowing the video to be
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
disseminated um would have a chilling
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
effect on people coming forward to to
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
provide information to the police such
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
as Witnesses
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it would necessarily
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect at first I think
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
eventually it may um because I think
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
once people realize that this is going
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
to end or potentially
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
can start ending up on YouTube can
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
potentially start ending up being edited
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
by a defendant and then put on YouTube
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
in the future um would certainly have a
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
chilling effect I know that for for me
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
personally having been involved in many
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
many body worn camera cases at this
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
point I know that for me personally I'd
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
be reluctant to talk to the police on a
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
body warn camera which is saying a lot
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
for a person who's been a prosecutor
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
over 20 years because because I don't
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily want that distributed to the
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
defense the public or being out there if
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
I could if I could answer that too um
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
one item is uh that hasn't been
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that some investigations
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
take officers into private homes and the
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
interior of your private home should be
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
sankers sacked you know there should be
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
no one going into your private home and
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
I can tell you right now that along the
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
lines of what attorney Andress says said
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
if if an officer came to my house
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
wanteded to interview me and I have a
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
body War camera I'm not bringing them
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
into the house because there's a I
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
believe right now that there's a
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of that camera material
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
being leaked out and the contents of my
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
house being being monetized by somebody
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
on a uh internet
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
video I know some of the uh most
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
entertaining videos um out there right
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
now are body camera videos and I my my
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
son who lik likes to look at the the
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
First Amendment videos
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
um never finds one from New Hampshire
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
and I I I like that um uh having said
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
that there there do seem to be some some
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions to your point that need
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
clarification further questions from the
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee Mr Newman representative
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you you mentioned in your
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that there was a sign
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
significant amount of work done in the
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
other body in this language that might
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
that you've
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
raised um do you think that language
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
similar to that if it were amended to
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
this bill might make the bill better to
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
get closer to what you think might be um
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
represent Newman we're we're not going
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
to discuss the Senate bill if you don't
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
mind please I'm I'm just talking about
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
language similar to it if it exists
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
Wherever Would that I'm probably going
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
to make a a study committee of this and
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll take a look at the Senate
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so I'd rather I limited
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
the other side so um further questions
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
that don't involve the Senate
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
Bill seeing none thank you for your
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
1022 my first
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hines are you going to
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
bill are you going to represent
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
you ready thank you sorry uh thank you
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um um just again Dan Hines uh
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
way back from criminal defense lawyer
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't know it's particularly uh relevant
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
to this bill um but this bill what it
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
does is it amends part of our
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
prostitution um statute to change some
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
of those levels from a misdemeanor to a
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
violation level offense and I went
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
through the um the bill has various
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
paragraphs so some of it I think are a
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
lot more serious than others um so our
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
present law deals with felonies in
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
certain cases I'm not touching those um
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
in certain cases where it's a
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I'm still keeping that
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
because I think it's more of an issue um
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
than just regular sex work so the things
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
I don't want to change is where
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
someone's a legal dependent and capable
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
of support uh they're being supported by
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
someone else that's remaining
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or transporting another into
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
a state for sex work um I think those
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
are a lot more serious serous um in
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
regards to sex work um I think it's an
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
ISS interesting issue area of law where
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's legal to have sex with someone
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
unless you have they pay you or unless
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
you film it because then you're a porn
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
star um but I think there's various um
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
reasons of why we would want to reduce
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
the level of offense from a misdemeanor
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
to a violation level offense this bill
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
could help someone out who was a sex
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
worker and wants a career change um but
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they were convicted of
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
being a sex worker and now they have a
 
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
criminal record and they go to apply to
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
a job and the job says we don't want to
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
hire sex workers um so for just the
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
common run-ofthe-mill case this would
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
turn it into a violation level offense
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
um still against the law still has
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
penalties um and cour can I guess
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
address it in other different ways um
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important for to remove
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
the stigma of a criminal record on
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
people um just like we've done with
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
drugs over the years um so so when we
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to have people have the bill get
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
back into society um having criminal
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
record is not the best way to try um
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.630 align:start position:0%
record is not the best way to try um
accomplish

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
that I expect there's going to be
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that reducing it to a
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
violation will increase trafficking and
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
everything else I think that's
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um prostitution is not
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
illegal everywhere in this country
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
Nevada for instance it's legal um highly
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
regulated but legal they're not a Mecca
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
of sex traffickers um many other
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
countries in this world have legal
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
prostitution everyone's also not being
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
imported there um for trafficking cases
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't think there's any correlation
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
to it I think if anything it'll go down
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
um if seths workers um if it's not at
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
least the criminal offense um I think
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to need use the word
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
Handler or someone essentially
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
regulating how they're acting at the end
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the day this deals with consensual
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
conduct between to adults um if it's
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
coercive that's wrong um things can
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
address that my Stat or my proposed Bill
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
does not have does
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
not um lessen or do anything to any type
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
of trafficking it's still illegal um so
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
I suggest that this bill is just a way
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
for people who want a career change to
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
not have a criminal record thank
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you um representative Hines so
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um Las V or n
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
um which is an interesting case so what
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
Nevada did is they legalized
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
prostitution but they put significant
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
guard rails in place and controls and
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
regulations um providing for health for
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
the for the people involved um I I even
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
believe criminal record checks things of
 
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.630 align:start position:0%
believe criminal record checks things of
that

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
nature what you're doing though is just
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
taking the the criminal offense part of
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
it but leaving everything as
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
is don't you think that if we were to
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
consider removing the criminal um
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
criminal aspect of it that we should
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
likewise put some safety barriers in
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
there instead of just cutting it kind of
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
loose to the wild
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
west I'd be happy with that um yeah um I
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day the Nevada
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
NE sorry the Nevada model is a good
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
model um if there's any amendments or
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
study committee that wants to kind of
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
look into that I certainly support that
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
um I thought this was just a quicker way
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
to do something to address the issue but
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I like the Nevada model um if
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we could do to
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
make it work safer for sex workers I'm
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
questions yeah represent
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you chairman um I'm just
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any contact with
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
people in the sex worker community over
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
this bill I have not um so know I didn't
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
seek co-sponsors for any of my bills
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh so I was put them in um
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
I left them open to to co-sponsors uh
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
but no um in the past I know there's
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
been issues of I I think I did speak to
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
other legislators about how to address
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
this topic and we all came up with
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
different ideas on how what might be
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
best um so I think there's a problem and
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is one way to address it um
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's certainly other ways and um I'd
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
be happy with pretty much anything that
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
issue

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
Muse how difficult is it for a sex
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
worker to get uh convictions annulled
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
currently I'd have to double check the
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
analment statute but assuming so our
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
analment statute U basically says for a
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it can be an olded three
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
years after the what's called final
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
sentence so if for instance a lot of
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
times that's the day your sentence so if
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
you get a $100 fine that's your final
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
sentence the three years starts from
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
that day um the exception is let's say
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
it's a Class A misdemeanor which carries
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
up to a year in jail or some portion of
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
the fine is suspended for let's say onee
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
good behavior then that three years
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't start until that one year is up
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'd have to look at the statute to
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
specifically see if there's an exception
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
because there are a few crimes that
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
cannot be anned I don't know if this is
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
one of them I if it is then my reasoning
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
is wrong but otherwise the answer would
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
years representative
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I I just have a question
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
about the way that you're worded in the
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill and you've left in and what you've
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
taken out and it appears that you've
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
just moved things from a misdemeanor
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of them up to a violation you moved
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
some as from Felony up to misdemeanor
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
and then on the back until when you get
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
to P page uh the third page I guess it
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
is paragraph 8 you you remove a whole
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
lot of language from the bill I don't
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
see where that is duplicated in in the
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm just wondering why you took
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
all of that out and it seems to be a lot
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
of there seems to be a lot that's gone
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
went represent Newman you're talking
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
about um section eight section nine I'm
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about where after uh the
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
line begins out all the rest of it is
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
lined out yeah and it's unlike the first
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
part of the bill it went somewhere and I
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't know where it went and what effect
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
that has on the law thank you um look
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
that you are correct that was an
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
oversight it would made an amendment to
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
fix that I was not in my tent to remove
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
any of that uh my intent was only to
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
change penalties for part of it so yes I
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
agree this bill would need at a minimum
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
an amendment to put those back in um
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
looks like the numbering would have to
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
be changed uh I'm not sure it's my fault
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
for not looking back what the LSR is s
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%

force to Homeland Security
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
investigations where they provide um
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
they investigate incidents of
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking around the state as well as
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
providing investigative support training
 
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
and technical assistance to any other
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions around the state in human
 
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
trafficking cases as requested to the to
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
the level requested by that agency um
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire human trafficking
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
collaborative task force has worked hard
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
over the past decade to develop a robust
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary response to
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking and the language in this
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill will reduce protections for
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable individuals in our state and
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
create new Pathways to exploitation our
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
mission is heavily focused on supporting
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
victims um ensuring that anyone who's
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
been exploited is able to have a pathway
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
to stability and safety uh that's our
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
top priority um even above prosecution
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
and so our goal really is to Pro um as a
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
coalition and a task force is to protect
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
anyone who has been sexually exploited
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
or trafficked and this bill is counter
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
to those efforts I just wanted to
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
mention specifically um pertaining to
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
trafficking so as many of you I'm sure
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
know under New Hampshire RSA 6337
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
pertaining to trafficking a minor under
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
age 18 cannot consent to commercial
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
sexual activity so unlike with adult
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
victims of trafficking there's no need
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
to Pro to prove that the minor was
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
compelled to provide sexual Services
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
where there's a commercial exchange of
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
value and we're very concerned
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
specifically that the deletion in this
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
bill of language preventing there's
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
double negatives here preventing the use
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
of lack of knowledge of age as a defense
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
will weaken protections and safety for
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
minor victims and create an opportunity
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
for exploitation we're also very
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
concerned for adult and minor victims
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
alike that this bill will pave the way
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
for increased exploitation behind closed
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
doors and reduce the opportunities that
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and service providers
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
have to intervene identify victims of
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking and other forms of abuse in
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
order to provide life-saving referrals
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
to Services um my colleague from the
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
task force Lieutenant Tamara Hester of
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police will speak
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
after us and she can speak a little bit
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
more about the approach that law
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement is able to take in these
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
situations and the tools that they have
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
at their
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
disposal um and I know uh representative
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh Newman asked about some of the
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
deleted parts of this the current
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
statute um so I just wanted to speak uh
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
to that uh really briefly um the
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um this bill would repeal a
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
law that was only recently passed in New
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so in 2021 this legislature
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
and I remember working very closely with
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
members of this committee passed
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
hb123 um legislated legislation that
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
granted immunity from prosecution for
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
prostitution for reporting sexual
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
assault um as we testified then we
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
believe that no rape victim who comes
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
forward to report an assault or to
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
receive Medical Care uh should be
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
arrested as a consequence um and making
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
that care contingent on their
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
involvement with law enforcement in the
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system isn't acceptable
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
um so we worked really hard to make sure
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be any barriers um
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
to someone seeking service regardless of
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
um their situation or if they're in
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
prostitution um so we find it really
 
01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
alarming that that provision was removed
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
from statute because it's a a hugely
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
protective uh provision um and ensures
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
that victims are able to receive Medical
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
Care and other services that they're
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to in our state um so just to
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
wrap up um we just hope that you'll
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
consider voting no on this bill um and
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
we're always happy to provide
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
representing the new campire State
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
Police dep Department of Safety we are
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
also opposed to this bill uh the
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
concerns for us are also the strikeouts
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
of much of the language in sections 7
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
through n of that current statute um as
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the Coalition recently
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
signed into effect uh that would be
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
completely removing the protections for
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
the victims of sexual assault so it
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
would be also be even more sexual
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
assaults are under reported as it is and
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
removing those protections would even
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
further the underreporting of uh sexual
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
assault for us additionally the language
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
um that is also removed about utilizing
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
age as the uh not knowing the age of the
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
individual removing that as a defense
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
could also allow further exploitation of
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
miners which occurs extremely frequently
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
online if an individual
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
um is able to use that as a defense in
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
the statute so that is part of the
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
reason that we are opposed to this bill
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult from the
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
beginning to identify victims of
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
trafficking I know that um one of the
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
comments made by uh representative Hines
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
who is the sponsor of this bill was that
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
by lowering or decriminalizing as done
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
in some other states or as being
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
proposed currently would uh allow
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
individuals to potentially further gain
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
employment down the down the road um but
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
one of the as he mentions that is
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
consensual acts but also one of the
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses that is going to be
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
reduced in the way that the stat statute
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
is currently written to be amended would
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
be that in Section 1 B induces or
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise purposely causes another to
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
violate sub paragraph a uh which being
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that that is no longer a consensual act
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
for that person in the way that I I
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
understand that statute so that would be
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
a concern that the way that the statute
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
is uh proposed as well
 
01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:16.029 align:start position:0%
is uh proposed as well
now

01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
um decriminalizing this has the
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
potential ability to continue to exploit
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
some of the vulnerable populations uh a
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
lot of the victims of human trafficking
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
that uh are dealt with on the law
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of things are people
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
who have either mental health issues or
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues and we want to be
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
able to get them those services so in
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing it uh we therefore don't
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily have as much opportunity to
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
get them those services that they may
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
need um so with that being said uh the
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
department of safety is in opposition to
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so anyone else
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify on this bill who has
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
not testified seeing none I'm going to
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair um this bill is
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
related to the disorderly conduct
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
statute um so that statute is one of the
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
most broad statutes um some defense
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
lawyers like to call it a catchall when
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
police want to charge someone with
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
something hey this a statute to go to so
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
one part of this statute specifically
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm repealing or seeking to repeal
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
is what's otherwise referred to as the
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
fighting law Doctrine um so the statute
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
presently says it's a crime to direct at
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
another person in a public place obscene
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
derisive or offensive words which are
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
likely to provoke a violent reaction the
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
problem with that is I suggest that's
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
protected under the First Amendment
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
threats are not protected under First
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment we already have um a statute
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with criminal threatening if I'm
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
threatening someone that is a crime what
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
this statute does is saying my words
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
calling you something if you're likely
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
to react violently then that's against
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
the law think of the worst possible
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
thing someone can come up to your face
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
and tell
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
you if they say that to you you should
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
not then be able to respond and punch
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
them in the face um this um statute um
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
comes from a case years ago that went up
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
to Supreme Court chaplinsky um it's
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate New Hampshire was the one
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
that led to that but like I said or
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
alluded to ear earlier it's What's
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
called the Fighting where's exception to
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment um thankfully the
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
court has in subsequent years um limited
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
the scope of that statute um so I think
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
now it's some limited to True threats so
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
as justest comples was a minimum wrongly
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
decided but even if not um has at least
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
been limited um under subsequent case
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
law the statute is pretty rare I don't
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
know that I've had anyone specifically
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
charged with this part um part of it um
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
being that it's possibly limited and
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
often I mean it's a First Amendment
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
issue um but one of the
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
notes oh um the chaplinsky case I think
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's interesting the words that they use
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
that actually led to the conviction that
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court upheld the person
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
called someone a town of I believe cev
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
Town official a damned fascist I suggest
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's pretty mild in today's um
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
political climate we hear presidential
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
candidates calling people that we hear
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
people calling presidential candidates
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
that um people should be allowed to
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
speak their mind um it's protected on
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment of the Federal
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution we also have a similar
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
under the state constitution I've
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
suggested to you that the worst possible
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
thing I say to you does not give you the
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
right to attack me people do not have
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
that right we already have laws
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
protecting threat threats against people
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
we have laws against assault um so I
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
suggest the statute even though it's
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
rarely enforced it's on the books I
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad thing and I think we
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
should repeal it and I'm happy to take
 
01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.709 align:start position:0%
should repeal it and I'm happy to take
any

01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative do
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
you have the the names of the cases that
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
you said that have subsequently um
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
subsequently narrowed the definition of
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
fighting words if you do if you could
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
just email them to me so I don't
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
misspell them and have to I can't I can
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
it was mainly one case uh I believe it's
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
St Paul B B but
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
um yep so RV St Paul that was 1992 and
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
the other one I didn't mention Cohen V
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
California back in 71 and that's the
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
case referred to as the draft um
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
that was a case where someone was in
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
court his jacket said the draft
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
that was against the law and Supreme
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
Court said hey that's constitutionally
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
protected um I believe that more of an
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
obscene word statute not a fighting
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
words one but um it has essentially been
 
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
a little narrowed in that I would
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
suggest if I can say that I should be
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
able to say someone's a damn fascist

questions for sponsor seeing none thank
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
Lavoy good morning Mr chair and members
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Chad Lavoy
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a major with the state police and
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also representing the the department
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
of safety today and opposition of this
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
bill um we're not trying to take away
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
first you know Amendment speech or
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that from people I think
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
that repealing this part of disorderly
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
conduct um is basically a loss of ground
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
on the expectation of a civil society
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we have um I'm trying to think of
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
an example that I could give you and one
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
is basically a sporting event you know
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
you have a youth or a school event or a
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
kids sporting event we have parents
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
Spectators kids involved um AOW o ing
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
for this type of you know obscene
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
derisive or offensive words to be exch
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
exchanged back and forth in a school
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
setting in a sporting setting any public
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
building uh back and forth is just
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
opening us up for further damages
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
further crimes to be committed by people
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
in the public um regardless of their age
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
um I think giving humidities propensity
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
for escalation um law enforcement we
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
like to take interaction and and be
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
proactive and interact and and try to be
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
reactive and stop something before it
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
gets worse and I think allowing this to
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
become basically words exchanged back
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
and forth until basically an assault
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
occurs or anything like that is really
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
not what we're for we're here to stop
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
something before someone gets hurt or
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
more crimes are committed by those
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
involved and just opening this up to
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
allowing this type of um you know
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
slander and abusive words back and forth
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh is reasons why we are uh opposing
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
written thank
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh major Lavoy um I'm
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
trying to think of an example myself
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
what about um for example closing time
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
in a bar everyone's outside everyone's
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
inebriated people start back and forth
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
could that have potential to to lead to
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
um fighting as
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
people's um senses are a little bit
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
dulled from the alcohol they don't know
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
that maybe I shouldn't punch this person
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
after they called me whatever I mean is
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
that does that help diffuse the
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
situation or does it not help sure
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be times where I think
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
where words are exchanged and you know
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is nothing that
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
escalates beyond the words that are
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
exchanged U but I think that we could
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
all agree that there are going to be
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
times where the words are going to
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
escalate someone's reaction uh to
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
hearing that type of verbal slander or
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
abuse towards them um that could
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
escalate to further crimes uh being
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
committed if you if you know um how many
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
times or how often is this charge
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
brought the fighting words portion of
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
it I would say it's not that often I
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact number but just to
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
guess I mean the majority of these
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
things within the disorderly conduct um
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
as you can see before it rises to a
 
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
misdem meter they're giving a warning
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
anyways by a police officer to stop
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing that violates
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that disorderly conduct statute okay
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
being here um I just uh I agree with
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
what representative Hines uh said
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
earlier that that doesn't give you the
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
right to um impose physical violence on
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
on someone else um but so what I'm
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
wondering is you know is this kind of is
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
it that both people are charged is
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
someone uh who reacts in that way in a
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
physical way are they also charged with
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
assault if a physical assault occurs I
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
mean is this used as a defense for a
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
person you know what I mean in the way
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
that they're saying um oh this this
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
instigated uh my reaction and now I am
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
absolved from accountability for my own
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
reaction I don't know if it's used as an
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
excuse to to justify an assault or
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that but at the same time
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
I mean we're looking at something we
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't want it to go above and beyond a
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
verbal altercation if we can stop a
 
01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
verbal you know abuse back and forth
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
between adults or children and adults or
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
whatever that's that's our goal okay
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um major if you if you may the
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
the common understanding that most
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
people have um with regard to words is
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know you can't yell fire in a
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
crowded theater um it's that's not used
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
as a defense or anything like that it's
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
simply because it can cause injuries by
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
people fleeing would you agree that the
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
fighting words is kind of similar and
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
that you it's not whether the person
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
hits you they get to use it as a defense
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's more used to stop someone from
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
escalating a situation that's correct
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree with that thank you
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of the concern that I have are is
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
use of this type of language in in
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
public meetings so if if we pass a law
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
like this um uh for example would would
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy still have the legal
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
ability to eject somebody from a
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing who uses this type of
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
language I think disorderly conduct
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
statute is Broad like representative hin
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
says but it does cover public hearings
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
and so forth within the statute if they
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
are being disruptive in a public hearing
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
or manner like that um but this just
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
takes away one more thing where someone
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
could be at a sporting event and just
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
saying these they might not be loud like
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
other terms are used within the statute
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
but they could be saying these types of
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
words to kids on a sporting field or
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
other parents within the stands and
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're trying not to
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
to get to at that point so bad dads
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
right correct okay
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative s thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
and and thank you major um I'm curious
 
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.629 align:start position:0%
and and thank you major um I'm curious
how

01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
this this Law relates to um people using
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
hate speech um using you know
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
specifically um like anti-semitic racist
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
homophobic or other similar types of of
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
terminology in a public
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
setting I can give you examples of many
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know large Gatherings when we went
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
through the civil unrest you know
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
through covid and everything after 2020
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know High you know areas of
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know frustration that we were
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
involved with as an agency I can speak
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
of and we are very cautious not to take
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
action when there is um you know
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
frustrations on both sides whether it's
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
politics whether it's a certain case
 
01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
that it involves um you know we're not
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get involved in those aspects
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's more or less the words that are
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
exchanged that have the propensity to
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
lead to something
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
worse thank you um I guess I'm I'm
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
thinking there was a story in the paper
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
about a high school basketball game that
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
had to be ended um because students on
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
one team were uh using hate speech
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
against another that led to an
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
altercation right obviously that had to
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
be handled but so I'm not talking about
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
things that are necessarily directed at
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
police officers in various settings but
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
if for example I were to turn to one of
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and make a really hateful
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
comment about their identity in some
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
capacity such that it's likely to
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
provoke them to want to punch me as a
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
result is that covered under this is
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
yeah if they if they feel that it's
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
offensive I think what we're trying to
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
do is just stop that from escalating at
 
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
do is just stop that from escalating at
that

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
point yeah that's one problem with the
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
fighting words is it's not really
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
clearly defined what exactly they are so
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's situational um and it's up to the
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and then it ends up to
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the court where they decide whether the
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement made the right call or
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
not um okay further questions seeing
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
me good morning my name is Melissa Davis
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of the New
Hampshire

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
is that better thank you I
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
apologize uh I'm also a a professor at
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
UNH law I've been practicing criminal
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
defense for almost 20 years um and I am
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
the director of the criminal Practice
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
Clinic um I do want to say that you know
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
as I read this statute and it is a
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
statute I've dealt with many times
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct I'm not here to
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
condone hate speech in any way um or
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I do think that
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
something that might be accomplished um
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
through this bill um that has not yet
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
been brought up and that could be
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
considered is um how it is applied to
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
juveniles so um as you all know all the
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
laws um and criminal uh statutes that
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
are in a force also applied to juveniles
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
um and it is I have really only seen
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
this offense brought in two situations
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the most part one isn't an
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
interaction with a police officer and
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
most of the time I'm in the position of
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
arguing that a police officer in that
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
situation is not being provoked to a
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
violent action uh because of their
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
training um but when it comes to kids in
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
school and things that are said I think
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the statute is often used in order to um
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
maybe bring a kid who is upset
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
frustrated um challenging um dealing
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
with situations and using language that
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
people do not feel is appropriate for
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
kids um to then charge them and bring a
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
charge against them that then brings
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
them into um the New Hampshire uh family
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
court system into the juvenile system
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
which um I believe often times does more
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
harm um than anything else rather than
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with it within the school um and
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
the increased presence of school
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
resource officers um allows for um I
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
think uh investigation by law
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement into these types of offenses
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
when they would have previously just
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
been dealt with by you know School
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
actions suspensions teachers you know
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
getting involved parents getting
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
involved in whatever um but if they've
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
reached the point where they feel like
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some kind of um legal
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
investigation going on it's when this
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
charge often comes up it's really the
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
only place I've seen it um otherwise I
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
think you know it's not something that
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with I am sensitive to you
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
know sort of the Civil discourse that's
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
out there in the world right now um and
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on and um you know
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
definitely and I'm a proponent of people
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
being able to engage in conversation
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
which they disagree without resorting to
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things which is why I
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
think the statute
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
appropriately designates likely to
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
provoke violent reaction uh but I think
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
the intention here can and how it's
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
applied is often in the school setting
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted you to know
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
um with regard to what you said earlier
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
where police charg people for saying
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
these things to them hasn't the court
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
already ruled that the police um for
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
example in disturbing the peace their
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
peace can't be disturbed does that not
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
also apply to um it doesn't I mean um
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
often times I would say you know
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
um it we end up still they end up still
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this type of charge it's not as
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
though they don't bring it because of
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
that issue we would argue that again the
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
statute provides the defense which I um
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
expressed about um not provoking violent
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
reactions on behalf of police officers
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
but it's still often brought um and
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
something that we're um defending
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
against and most of the time it's you
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
know oftentimes it's things that are
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
said in the back of Cruisers or you know
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
while arrest is being affected and it's
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
in combination with other charges that
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
um are going to get the job done uh More
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
Than This disorderly conduct charge
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
will thank you any questions for the um
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
represent uh the attorney from UNH
 
01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.990 align:start position:0%
represent uh the attorney from UNH
representative

01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
Newman do I understand you correctly
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that maybe um a waiver for
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
minors incorporated into the law in some
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
manner would be helpful I think so I
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
mean I think um you I don't know how to
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily affect that um but that you
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
know within a school setting um that
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh there' be limitations on it
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.629 align:start position:0%
to some extent
um

01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you represent Reed thank you
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so if a student is um you
 
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
know using words to the point of being
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
arrested um and having to go before a
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
judge don't you think that maybe um some
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
court appointed family counseling would
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
be um a better um help for this student
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
than letting the principal deal with it
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
um I just seems like maybe a a court
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
intervention is not such a bad thing I
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I think you're assuming
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
the outcome and that's oftentimes not
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
the result of what would happen based on
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
an arrest and on that kind of charge um
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that you know the the
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
resources that are available to help
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
parents um enroll their kids in
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
counseling if you know they are
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
struggling in some way or out there and
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't necessarily rely on um the
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
have followup yes please so generally if
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
a student is a what what is the out what
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
is the you know what is the process
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you they're given a petition um
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
then they're required to go to court uh
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're then given a lawyer um the case
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
is then either negotiated or it goes to
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
trial the negotiation you know can
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
result in a number of things um and does
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
it necessarily always include counseling
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
um especially if this is just a minor
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
offense like this violation actually is
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's not always an
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
automatic outcome towards counseling I
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
think there there are other um systems
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
within the schools uh and that are more
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
able to direct a family to counseling
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
than the like I said the the delinquency
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
system I have a question so if you have
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
a student at a school say a high school
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you have some pretty big students
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
there and they're out of control they
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
won't listen um they're yelling
 
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.270 align:start position:0%
won't listen um they're yelling
screaming

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
screaming
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
swearing does this not take a tool away
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
from the um the school and law
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement to extricate them from that
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
situation before it gets worse and leads
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
to assault and other violent felonies so
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that law enforcement
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't respond and attempt to Dees
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
alate I would argue that um I think the
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
school and the counselors and the people
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
that work with the students more
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
regularly are more able to deescalate in
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
that situation um the whether it leads
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a charge though I think is the issue
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you um represent
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
Professor for being here um so just to
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
be clear are you in support or
 
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
opposition or neutral to the bill or
 
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see the bill come out as
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh with limitations for students or
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
or you think that um it would be better
 
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
just left
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
alone I I do favor limitation for
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
students um or young people especially
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
because um you know of their age and
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when they are sort of just
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term mouthing off
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
and saying things and being provocative
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
with their language oftentimes that is a
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
way to try to deescalate to keep
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
themselves from using physical conduct
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
and things like that um and I understand
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's disruptive but I again School
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
behavior is better at it I worry about
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
um you know uh vacating it completely
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
only because I do think um while there
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
are free speech rights if it's going to
 
01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
provoke someone just out among adults in
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
the regular Community then then um the
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
statute is effectively dealing with
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
good represent
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair um I'm curious and
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit concerned about um
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
the implications of the lesson that this
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
would be that this is teaching to
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
Children um that there is essentially an
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
excuse for physical violence that you
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
know in my opinion that should be
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
limited to you being under physical
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
threat my question is um how do you
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
think that this affects children um
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
overall and do you think that that is a
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I quite understand the
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
question I think that um the existence
 
01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
question I think that um the existence
of

01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
a uh penalty that would result in a
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
child entering the court system um I
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't think actually teaches the lesson
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
um in the situation about how to speak
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
or behave or have conversation um or
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
Express anger and I think that's better
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
left to counselors teachers parents um
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
um community and things like that I
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
don't think at the end of the day a
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
student when they are upset and swearing
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
is thinking I'm going to end up in court
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to end up you know sort of
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
involved in the court system um in that
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
situation just real quick followup um
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
okay so um you would
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
rather um amend it in a way that um the
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
consequence of that for juveniles would
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
be um some type of
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
alternative um
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
resolution not the court yeah yeah okay
 
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.149 align:start position:0%
resolution not the court yeah yeah okay
thank

01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
you just for clarification the this this
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
charge has to occur in the presence of
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
an officer is that correct this isn't
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
one that can be arrested for after the
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
fact or is it in the case of school
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
students you can be arrested after the
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
fact okay and you know it may be a
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
teacher it may be a school resource
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
officer it may be another you know
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
student or whoever that makes the
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
allegation thank
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.030 align:start position:0%
allegation thank
you

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
any any further
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh I thought you needed a
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
warrant if the officer didn't actually
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
witness the
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
event you would but that doesn't mean
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
you couldn't still go forward with the
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
charge after a warrant has been signed
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
yes and that that's really what I was
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
getting at it wasn't some a past
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that you could arrest for
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
right on the scene you would have to
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
investigate and apply for a
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
warrant yes thank
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%

because we have 56 bills and they're
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to stack up quick and I do not
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
want to be here in

01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill and before you start if you would
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
on the ones I um I committed um
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittees for if you could work with
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees please thank
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair uh so what this
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill does is it turns uninspected
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles from a primary stop into what's
 
01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
called a secondary stop so a secondary
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
secondary offense means an officer needs
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
to observe some other traffic violation
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
in order to enforce in this case the
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
uninspected vehicle um and there's a
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
couple reasons I think this is a good
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
thing so one it can actually help
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
officer safety um so a lot of times
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
officers when they're pulled over on the
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
side of the road that's the most
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous spot for the officer so
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
presumably this will lead to less stops
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day there are so
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
many traffic laws and if officer wants
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
to find a reason to pull someone over
 
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to all they have to to do
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
his weight someone's going to do 31 and
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
a 30 someone's going to touch a line
 
01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
someone's going to do something uh but
 
01:54:58.069 --> 01:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully by making a secondary offense
 
01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
officers can go on to more important
 
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
safety issues um so when a car fails an
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
inspection is not always a safety issue
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
we have emissions we could have minor
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
issues um and the officer they don't
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
know what the issue is they don't know
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
why a car failed um but they're
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
enforcing the law so this law changing
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
it to a secondary offense um if passed
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
and ultimately a lot of these offenses
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
are unfortunately basically a crime on
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
being poor a lot of people who don't
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
have inspected Vehicles it's because
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
they tried to get an inspection and
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
there was an issue with the vehicle that
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
um might cost thousands of dollars in
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
repairs and they just don't have that
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
money so rather than having to pay for
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
some non-safety issue to get their
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle up and running they'll just risk
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
it drive hope they don't get pulled over
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
for it um so this will lessen that and
 
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
um by by just repeatedly giving people
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
violations um for this offense they then
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
are now out fine money and still have to
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
deal with their vehicle um and I know my
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill only deals with uninspected
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles um if the committee wanted to
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
amend and expand to unregistered
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles I think that would also be
 
01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
great that really is a crime on poor
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
people um changing that to a secondary
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
offense um so ask would support this
 
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
bill I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.189 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
when a vehicle is rejected in New
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there a rejection sticker
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle it might depend on when you go
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
in because I think if you go in ahead of
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
time they won't take your present
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
sticker because it's still valid um I
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to after the fact
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
whether they can remove it and put on a
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
failure so I don't know I just I've had
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
Vehicles rejected I know there's a
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
letter that they hand you that says why
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
it was rejected and will'll say if it's
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
omissions or safety issue issues um but
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
from the officer standpoint of whether
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
they can tell I don't think there is but
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
I could be mistaken on that okay thank
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
you I I asked because I know in other
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
states they have rejection stickers and
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
some of them will be a different color
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
for example for safety only and that
 
01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
would be a r sticker and that would
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
indicate this vehicle is not safe to be
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
on the road versus just a warning light
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
that could be for anything so I was
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
curious um all right thank you any
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
further questions for the representative
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
represent whe
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative Hines
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
um I think it's 11 states that don't
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
require vehicle inspection at all 36
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
states that don't require annual
 
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.189 align:start position:0%
states that don't require annual
inspections

01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
um why if we were addressing the issue
 
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.310 align:start position:0%
um why if we were addressing the issue
of

01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
inspections um and if it were uh a
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
negative against poorer folks would
 
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
changing it to a secondary offense be
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
better than doing what those 11 to 36
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
states have done and getting rid of the
 
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
annual inspections no but I think the
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
votes were there which is why I didn't
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
put that bill in this is a middle ground
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
so I think this is better than nothing I
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
would prefer limiting and altogether
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
didn't see that happening so I was
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with some Middle
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
bad representative Balden then
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thanks for taking
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
my question I'm aware you're an attorney
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
um in your work with criminal defense um
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
 
01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
you generally see people of a lower
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
class or income driving with uninspected
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles versus maybe clients you've had
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
who are more financially well off is
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
that well so I think generally I only
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not appointed counselor public
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
defender so people would have to have
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
money to hire me um but a lot of times
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
people people um who get sometimes the
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
officers use this as a pretext just stop
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
someone and especially if it's late at
 
01:58:57.629 --> 01:58:57.639 align:start position:0%
night like hey let's see what else they
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
might be doing wrong but other times
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
probably more during the day officer
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
just wants to let someone know and give
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
some a lot of times they'll give them a
 
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
warning but a lot of times they won't
 
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
and they'll give them a ticket um a lot
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
of times it just depends on how close
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone was so a lot of officers will
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
use gu I'll say discretion and common
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
courtesy if someone's over a few days or
 
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks letting them know about
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
it but the longer that goes by the more
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
likely officer is to ticket someone and
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
this offense is just a violation level
 
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
offense um I don't think there's a
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum penalty um so I
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's like a $100 fine so at the
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
end of the day if someone has just a
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
$100 fine they're not hiring a lawyer
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're probably not going to court to
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
fight it um and they're probably just
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
mailing in a ticket um so hope that
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
is to your knowledge would um like a
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
conviction or whatever the terminology
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
would be for for um driving un inspected
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle would that result in points on a
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
license yep so while it's not a major
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
offense um and I don't believe it's a
 
02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
minor offense towards habital Fender it
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
is points um so that can lead to
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately someone losing their license
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
and if someone doesn't have money um
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
they're really not going to have money
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
if they can't drive to work which leads
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
to then people driving uh while under
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
suspension which leads to even further
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
problems um are you aware if it's points
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
for the operator or points for the
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
owner I can look into that I assumed the
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
operator but I don't know that off thank
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
also would that not also be caused for
 
02:00:37.629 --> 02:00:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Stone thank
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question are
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
you aware of any other secondary
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement on the motor vehicle code
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
currently being done in New
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think of it um off hand own
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
things so this is super common in other
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
states particularly with seat belts um
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
so I don't
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
know offhand I offand I don't think so
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
um but I know it's very common in other
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
states quick followup followup can you
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
tell me what the current fine is for an
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
inspected motor vehicle I can double
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
check it I believe it's around $100 but
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
I have to double check that all right
 
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.030 align:start position:0%
I have to double check that all right
thank

02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.709 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:01:19.719 --> 02:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
Newman having NE never ban a police
 
02:01:28.069 --> 02:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
officer I have no idea what the sentence
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's inserted in bold in this bill is
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
and what a secondary offense is and how
 
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
that affects me as the person who could
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
potentially be guilty of this
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
specifically as to when I would have to
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
get my vehicle inspected etc etc yep so
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
you would still have to get your vehicle
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
inspected um it only comes down to when
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
an officer can pull you over for it so
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
if your car is just parked on the road
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
an officer definitely should not be
 
02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
giving you a ticket for that um but if
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're driving if it's a secondary fence
 
02:01:58.990 --> 02:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
an officer cannot stop you just for that
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
so if the officer observes no other
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
traffic violation just sees that your
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
car is uninspected can't pull you over
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
if he pulls you over for speeding he
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
then can also give you the ticket for um
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
the secondary
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
offense just
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
follow so then if it's a secondary
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
offense you would be noticed that you're
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation or how how do you
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
then know that there there's an
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
objection to your having an unexpired
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
ticket y so the only thing that this
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
really does is determines when an
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
officer can stop you um so if it's just
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
the inspection violation can't stop you
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
if it's some other offense then he can
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
give you that ticket so the court
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
process would still be the same thing he
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
would assume he gives you a ticket he
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
could give you a warning still U but if
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
he gave you a ticket you would still go
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
through the entire court process you
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
could either be guilty by mail or have
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
court how about if I could just also add
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
that um an inspected vehicle some
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
officers I believe can it's never
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
happened to me when I was pulled over
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
for it uh but can actually tow the
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle causing further Financial harm
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
to people I believe for safety
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
violations um representative
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair um I thought that I
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
should just time in as somebody who has
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
been guilty of this offense and pulled
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
over for this offense um just
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
forgetfulness and you know missing the
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
date um I believe the first time uh that
 
02:03:27.149 --> 02:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
was the most imposition was because I
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
remedied the situation but forgot to
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
notify um forgot to you know respond to
 
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
the specific ticket but I I believe it
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
was a fix it ticket and then uh and then
 
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
I the other one was just a warning so
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering you know what kind of
 
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
imposition this is if there's a process
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
for uh being able to remedy it as long
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
as you um satisfy you know notify the uh
 
02:03:53.709 --> 02:03:53.719 align:start position:0%
police and respond to the ticket as well
 
02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
as uh addressing the issue itself yep I
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
would support that I think that's an
 
02:04:00.669 --> 02:04:00.679 align:start position:0%
alternative approach to it um my bill
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
does not do that um but I think yeah
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
remedy would be also a good solution to
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
this problem um the problem is still
 
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to be it would help cases like
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
yours or others where they forget but if
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
someone knows that their vehicle's not
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
inspected because they can afford it
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
giving them a warning really I mean my
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
give him 30 days to come up with the
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
money but other than that isn't really
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
helping that
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
person represent Manion thank you Mr
 
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
chair just to answer your question I
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
believe it depends who the ticket was
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
written out to if it's written to the
 
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
operator would be on the operator and if
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
it written on the owner it' be on the
 
02:04:37.629 --> 02:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
owner thank you um while we're having a
 
02:04:40.109 --> 02:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
side exchange here um do you know if
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
there's a rejection sticker put on
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles I don't believe so but maybe TS
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
out I have one you have a sticker
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
temporary sticker put on for has uh if
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
you have a pollution dash light come on
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
so they'll give you a 30 days to fix
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
that because sometimes it's expensive
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not a hazard to the vehicle
 
02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.629 align:start position:0%
and it's not a hazard to the vehicle
gotcha

02:05:01.629 --> 02:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
if if we had
 
02:05:11.159 --> 02:05:12.669 align:start position:0%
if if we had
stickers

02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
stickers
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
that delineated between a other
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
violation and a safety violation would
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
you think that that would be acceptable
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement to be able to stop
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
those vehicles with the safety based on
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
that I think from a public policy
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's more important to stop
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe vehicles um from the standpoint
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
of a driver who can't afford it at the
 
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
end of the day I mean they want to get
 
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
it fixed they just can't afford it but I
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
I still think that is better than
 
02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:43.719 align:start position:0%
nothing I I and this is somewhat
 
02:05:47.229 --> 02:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
rhetorical but somewhat not um the the
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason we have the stickers and they're
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
so big is obviously so law enforcement
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
can see them if it were a secondary
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
offense there'd be no need of those
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
stickers it it could be something
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
entered on a
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
registration and I don't know what if
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
any money that would save the state but
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
potential something if I were a sponsor
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
might want to call do and find out how
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
much it cost um representative
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you could an unintended
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
consequence of your
 
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
Bill be that somebody literally can say
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to drive real safe all the
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
time but I'm not getting my car
 
02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:30.679 align:start position:0%
inspected and he or she could go for
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three years without getting
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
stopped I think that's a good thing to
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
me that's an I would like that
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
consequence if someone's so safe that
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
they're not committing any traffic
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
violations not harming anyone they're
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
the ideal driver to me so I'd like to
 
02:06:44.239 --> 02:06:45.790 align:start position:0%
the ideal driver to me so I'd like to
see

02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
that yes my followup would be in they're
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
driving around on bald tires and they
 
02:06:50.239 --> 02:06:54.069 align:start position:0%
driving around on bald tires and they
don't

02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
care would I agree
 
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes any further questions seeing none
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for oh excuse me
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative side U I'm requesting
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
permission to make a comment because
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's not we're a hearing but I think a
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
comment is in order and I'd like to
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
start and you stop me if you don't like
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
it if it's appropriate here's here's
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
here for everybody there's part of our
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
culture and I got to pick you up on this
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative is that you said
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way well let's the
 
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
cop will want to kind of hassle this guy
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
or find do something else or check I'm
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
sorry um I have a question of the chair
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
or a point of order or something is it
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
not is it not inappropriate to debate um
 
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
when we're not in
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
exec um I'm going to I'm just allowing
 
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
him a little way to make his comment if
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's objectionable I just thought maybe
 
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
it be better for I've been generally
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
lenient with everybody I don't want to
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
turn into that guy so I just hoping we
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
could make a practice of of uh of
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
framing our debate as questions instead
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
of overly debating thank you I'm
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to stop I'm advertising
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
this as a comment and uh I don't really
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
want to get into a debate all I'm saying
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
is part of our culture that we accepted
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
that statement uncritically look I've
 
02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
been in a report room for many years and
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
heard many candid conversations with
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
police and I've never heard anybody any
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
police officer say any conduct of that
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
type that they're out to do to hassle
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
they'll run a plate to see if there's an
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
outstanding warrant but that's the most
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
extremely your point is taken I
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
understand talking about our our culture
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to culture um I as the chair
 
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
I don't choose to rebut statements by
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
witnesses that may or may not be um
 
02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:47.559 align:start position:0%
objective with regard to their opinions
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement or not um I believe
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can defend themselves
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
and we're here to just hear the facts
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
and the concepts uh thank you for your
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you another car
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
welcome uh Mr
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
hson good morning Mr chairman and good
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
morning to members of the committee
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time to listen
 
02:09:21.069 --> 02:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
to me I have some prepared remarks and
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
then I will be happy to take your
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions um much like a driver's a test
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's provided uh to ensure the
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and safe driving habits um
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
prior to getting a license uh state
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
inspections ensure Vehicles Upon Our
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
roadway are safe and both of those
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
actions both driving test and uh state
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
inspection uh ensure or the goal is to
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
ensure um safe safety on our roadways um
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire data for um years 22
 
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:57.870 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire data for um years 22
and

02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
23 we've stopped and cited more than
 
02:10:02.079 --> 02:10:03.629 align:start position:0%
23 we've stopped and cited more than
10,000

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
10,000
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
drivers uh in that time period for not
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
having the vehicle inspected and that
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the warnings that we
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
issue either and I would venture to
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
Guess that there's probably a large
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
number that were just
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
warnings um that represents at least
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
10,000 vehicles that potentially could
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
have been unsafe for the
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
road um the in 2018 a national highway
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
safety administration published a study
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
which I have copies and I'll leave for
 
02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:37.750 align:start position:0%
which I have copies and I'll leave for
you

02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
um of critical reasons for motor vehicle
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
crashes and approximately 2% of those
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
crashes which was
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
44,000 the critical reason was a
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
component failure or degreg of the
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle and of those um Vehicles
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
identified as having
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
a mechanical component that caused the
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
crash 35% of them were components
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
particularly um wheels and tires and
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
other uh 22% of those were related to
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
brakes uh a tiered approach to to the
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of state inspections
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
undermines the safety of the public by
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
Leading them to believe that motor
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections are not an important
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
part of ensuring our safe roadways
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
States would participate in tiered
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement see an increase in secondary
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
law violations consequently this model
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
was most likely to result in a negative
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
effect on highway safety and increase
 
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the possibility of motor vehicle
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
accidents a secondary inspection law
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
would most likely result in fewer
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
inspected vehicles on our roadways the
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
risk associated with operating a motor
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle which has not been inspected is
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
unknown uh to the off operator unlike
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
texting and driving or drinking and
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
driving you know what you're doing is
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
wrong um not having your vehicle
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
inspected unless you're a mechanic um
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
you really have no idea if there's
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with the vehicle or
 
02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:05.270 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with the vehicle or
not

02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
um somebody that's operating an un
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
uninspected vehicle um is a lot of times
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
unaware if there's a safety issue with
 
02:12:16.109 --> 02:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
with their vehicle a couple of things
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
that I I I want to say about Beyond this
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
is that we can't
 
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
quantify how many crashes were avoided
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
because we stopped somebody identified
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
the vehicle was uninspected and then
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
they got the vehicle inspected and or
 
02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
they got the vehicle inspected and or
repaired

02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
repaired
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't
 
02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
know as far as the question about a
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
sticker on a vehicle if your vehicle
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
goes in for inspection and it passes the
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
safety inspection but it does not pass
 
02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
the emissions we put a 60-day sticker on
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
that vehicle so we can identify that it
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
has an emissions problem but not a
 
02:12:54.750 --> 02:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
safety problem there is a process um
 
02:12:59.549 --> 02:12:59.559 align:start position:0%
through the DMV that if you pass safety
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
and there is an issue with the emission
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
system that either is extremely costly
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
or it cannot be fixed there's a waiver
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
process with the DMV to remedy that as
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
well so we currently have no
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
secondary stop statutes here and New
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we there are none of those so
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
one of the other questions that was
 
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
raised or that I have is that without
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
having the bill right in front of
 
02:13:37.229 --> 02:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
me this is New Hampshire registered
 
02:13:37.239 --> 02:13:38.910 align:start position:0%
me this is New Hampshire registered
Vehicles

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
Vehicles
 
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
however I'm on the commercial Motor
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Enforcement side of things and
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
there is a federal mandate for anything
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's operated as a commercial motor
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle so so there's another component
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
to this that's not addressed in the
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
bill um this is a safety issue this is
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
not anything other than that
 
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.390 align:start position:0%
not anything other than that
and

02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're concerned with safety and in
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
the example of somebody that hasn't had
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
their vehicle inspected for three years
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
because they didn't in commit any other
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
um vehicle violation um we see vehicles
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
that are one and two years old that have
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
mechanical defects that fail inspection
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
and not being able to stop
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
somebody to remind of of that is it just
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
it flies in the face of everything that
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do as far as Public
 
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:42.950 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do as far as Public
Safety

02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
goes so that's all I have like I said
 
02:14:46.549 --> 02:14:46.559 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll leave this information for the
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh and I I will be glad to
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions that anybody has for
 
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
me thank you um Sergeant can you tell us
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
what's involved in the safety inspection
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of it what do they check for that
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
someone might not so basically what we
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
call critical vehicle components brakes
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
tires steering
 
02:15:07.629 --> 02:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
exhaust um those are the big ones
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
obviously anything that would control
 
02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:11.589 align:start position:0%
obviously anything that would control
the

02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle um yes and we do check the
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
emission system that's that's a Federal
 
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
Regulation that obviously we have to
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
follow as well but it's truly safety
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
again those components that um you know
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
we're not going to check the radio
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we do however
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
heater defroster all the lighting the
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
horn all those things that relate to the
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
safety side of of operating the
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle I've I've noticed in the last
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
decade um the more and more Vehicles
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
become computerized the more and more
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
systems that aren't readily available to
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
for you to self diagnose so a lot of
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
folks get failed because of a warning
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
light and the warning light could have
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with the
 
02:15:59.470 --> 02:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle safety or emissions it could
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
have to do with the your seat heater
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't work anymore correct how does
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
how does the inspection station
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate or do they just fail you
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a warning line no so um
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
those things that cause a failure light
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
like that are not considered so it's
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
truly both a safety and emissions um
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
inspection but those ancillary systems
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
are not something that the inspection
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
station looks at they would certainly
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
call it out in their um report to the
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
consumer that a it passed both safety
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
and um emissions however there are other
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
problems with your vehicle it's not
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
something that it would get failed
 
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
for it was my understanding that they
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
were failing people regularly just
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
because there was any kind of light on
 
02:16:44.519 --> 02:16:46.669 align:start position:0%
because there was any kind of light on
the

02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
the
dash

02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm not aware that that's
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
a a common
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
practice representative
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
sing thank you um may I ask two
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you so um are you
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
aware of of officers either state or
 
02:17:11.230 --> 02:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal who deliberately seek out car
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
inspections um for the purposes of
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not to stop
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
some I I'm not aware no okay just for
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
clarification there's no difference
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
between that and saying I'm looking for
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
Speeders I mean it's an obvious
 
02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:24.830 align:start position:0%
Speeders I mean it's an obvious
violation

02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
violation
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
so just thank you and um also you
 
02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this doesn't address
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles so if there were an
 
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that made it
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
specific to non-commercial Vehicles
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
would it change your perspective about
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
no represent
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm I'm interested
 
02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
in you said there were a lot of warnings
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
that are given and so that I would I'm
 
02:17:57.319 --> 02:17:58.270 align:start position:0%
that are given and so that I would I'm
curious

02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
curious
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
about why does an officer give a warning
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
is it relative to how the operator
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
responds or is it just it's a newer
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle or well obviously there's
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
officer discretion that goes along with
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
anything we do
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
roadside with a few exceptions so
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
personally um if somebody is at day 11
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
rather than day 10 so obviously the law
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
allows 10 days into the following month
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
before we can actually write a ticket so
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
on day 11 yes there are probably some
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
officers that would write a ticket um
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
personally maybe not uh maybe a warning
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
suffices um however you're right there
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
are some instances where driver attitude
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
does come into play there I I will
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
certainly say that um but for for the
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
most part um personally it's you know
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
did you forget uh or is there an actual
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
deficiency with a vehicle that needs to
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
be fixed um you know in this day and age
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
um yes people forget a lot of things
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
however um you know somebody that fails
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
to get a 2024 inspected probably is a
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
different um situation that somebody has
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
a 2014 or a 2013 vehicle that you know
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
inspected Sergeant is it unusual for
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
someone to say look there's I just can't
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
afford this thing is broken this
 
02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
particular component it's going to cost
 
02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
me $5,000 it's worth more than the
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
car we we I'm sure there are certainly
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
instances that that that does
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
happen followup yeah just a followup so
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
now I get a warning what what what
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
happens then as a result of getting a
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to get stopped
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
again um no typically um at least in my
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
experience uh if I've issued a warning
 
02:20:02.910 --> 02:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
inspected there's there's no system
 
02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
though is there a system in place where
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
um Trooper a gives a warning Trooper B
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
pulls the same person over a week later
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
can he see that that person was
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
previously given a warning yes we we our
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
system allows that does that help
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
represent good U representative
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you for taking my question
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
I was just hoping to get clarification
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
on your answer to an earlier question um
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
if a vehicle has a check engine light on
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um it's I assume it's my understanding
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
is it's failed um and I think the
 
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
question that the chairman was trying to
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
ask is if there's a check engine light
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
on um related to an issue that's not a a
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
safety concern how would the inspecting
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
um um shop identify that would it come
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
at some cost to the driver or the owner
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle to to make um make it
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
possible for the shop to identify the
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
cause of the check engine light and is
 
02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
it possible that there are people failed
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
for check engine lights who don't have a
 
02:21:06.359 --> 02:21:07.670 align:start position:0%
for check engine lights who don't have a
safety

02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
issue so uh to answer your question most
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
every shop or I believe every shop um
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
has the ability to determine
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
what the system is that causes that to
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
to show up
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
certain failures of components in
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I use the radio as an
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
example that although it may be a
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
convenience issue is not a safety issue
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
or an emissions issue so it should not
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
cause that vehicle to be
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
failed um yes manufacturers are very
 
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
good about telling you when something is
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
wrong but if it's not any of those
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
critical components or it's not part of
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
the emission system that notification
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
should not preclude that vehicle from
 
02:21:58.439 --> 02:22:00.670 align:start position:0%
should not preclude that vehicle from
passing

02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
passing
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
inspection it's my understanding that
 
02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong that each
 
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
time um so the the shop plugs the OBD
 
02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
plugin it gets a code and then they have
 
02:22:12.750 --> 02:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
to look up what that code means in
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
reference to that certain vehicle
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
correct and then they can tell what what
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
it is correct
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair um I just wanted to
 
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
clarify really quickly um something that
 
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
you said in your initial comments did
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
you say that
 
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
25% of the uh stops that were made on
 
02:22:38.830 --> 02:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of a um of a failed inspection
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
were breaks no that was I was uh
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
referring to the uh national highway
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
safety study that was done where they
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
looked at all the crashes looked at
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
those crashes that were caused or
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
the uh cause for the crash was listed as
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
component failure of those crashes 22% I
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
believe were noted as having being
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
related to breaks okay thank you I
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification and one
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
other thing that I I wanted to um bring
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
up is that um for New Hampshire a New
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone in both 22 and 23 we had
 
02:23:25.269 --> 02:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
at least one fatal crash that listed
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
equipment failure as the cause of the
 
02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.190 align:start position:0%
equipment failure as the cause of the
crash

02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
crash
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
so everything else
 
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
aside we're our goal is Zero fatalities
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so having
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
one fatality based on equipment failure
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
and with the information I have I can't
 
02:23:46.030 --> 02:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
tell whe you know whether that was
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
related to or what it was related to it
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
just is attributed to equipment failure
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know or I don't know sitting
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
here whether or not the vehicle was
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
currently inspected or not so we do have
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
crashes here in New Hampshire that not
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
only cause uh or equipment failure
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
causes crashes they also cause fatal
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you um any representative
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
bden thanks for taking another question
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
just quick question
 
02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
the single crash that you referenced um
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
do you know if it was a New Hampshire
 
02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
driver if it was exclusively New
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registered Vehicles involved I
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that information with me I'm
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
sorry thank
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
you sorry one more question
 
02:24:36.429 --> 02:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
the does the New Hampshire law
 
02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement have the ability to stop a
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle with a inspired inspection
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
sticker or no inspection sticker without
 
02:24:43.359 --> 02:24:45.950 align:start position:0%
sticker or no inspection sticker without
estate

02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.790 align:start position:0%
 
plates

02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
plates
 
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
on the non-commercial side
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
no so theoretically all of the drivers
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts currently could drive
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
up here with inspired stickers and we
 
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about that only our
 
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
own Vehicles correct thank
 
02:25:03.269 --> 02:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:24.510 align:start position:0%
 
Davis

02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
hello again I'm Melissa Davis I'm uh
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I am currently a professor at UNH law
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
um the statements I'm making are not uh
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
those of unh or UNH laws um and I have
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
been a practicing criminal defense
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
attorney for almost 20 years and I
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
currently run the criminal Practice
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
Clinic at the school um anecdotally I
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
will say um I think many people have
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
experience with uh the state inspection
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
system I'm not somebody who's originally
 
02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire but I have been here
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
um 20 years I will say that I have been
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh seen things such as rust visible rust
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
a check engine light as well as the
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturer bumper on the Chevy S10
 
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
truck that I moved here with all be
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
subject to reasons for um failing
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
inspection just anecdotally um I think
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
that the question here is what what
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
happens here for people who are without
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
means and I want to focus on that part
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the intention in this bill because um
 
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's it is the cost of obtaining the
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
inspection but it's also the cost of
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
fixing whatever issues may come up some
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
of which may be very significant um um
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
and uh being able to fix them and then
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
the consequences of that so really it's
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
how should this be enforced um you know
 
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this bill is not
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily about whether we should have
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
inspection but how failing to inspect
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
should be enforced and the question is
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
should it be um the reason for an
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
initial stop of a motor vehicle by law
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement or is it something that can
 
02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
be addressed um by law enforcement if
 
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
they are stopped for some other reason I
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
think the the issue here is one I will
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
say I do come across quite a number of
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
cases where the initial reason for the
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
Stop is um inspection sticker related
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
issues um what happens in that
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
situations is it's not as simple as you
 
02:27:21.269 --> 02:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
know sort of come up Officer says you
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
know you have this inspection sticker
 
02:27:25.389 --> 02:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
issue and that's the end of it the
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
questioning then goes on and it becomes
 
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
um a matter of sort of a longer period
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
of uh interaction between the driver and
 
02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
the um law enforcement officer when the
 
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
next questions come where are you going
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
where have you been where are you headed
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
to what are you doing out right now and
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
this is not with any suspicion these are
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
questions that come all the time in
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
those situations um sometimes it does
 
02:27:55.710 --> 02:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
lead to other um other types of offenses
 
02:27:57.150 --> 02:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
and I would you know argue that my
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
clients I am courta appointed counsel
 
02:28:00.269 --> 02:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
and I've been courta appointed counsel
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
my entire career um you know that it's
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
often my clients who are without means
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
um that are having the inspection issues
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
and then being stopped and then being
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
investigated um for potentially um other
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
crimes at that point will also say that
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
um the other issue is you know you get
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
this you stopped for this um offense um
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
you then may get a ticket for it uh that
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
is then money you don't have to pay um
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
that is then money that is owed to the
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
court if that doesn't get paid then your
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
license gets suspended um if you license
 
02:28:38.269 --> 02:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
gets suspended you can't go to work
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
probably the reason you were driving on
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
the the car that had the failed
 
02:28:43.469 --> 02:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker sticker was you were
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get to work um and you are
 
02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
then if you are then driving to work um
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
either the registration or the license
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
has been suspended it's not due to any
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
um uh unsafe driving necessarily by the
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
operator but it's simply a matter again
 
02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
of not having means in this state and I
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you these types of things
 
02:29:05.309 --> 02:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
snowball um over and over and over again
 
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
I've seen clients who have um uh
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
convictions for operating after
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
suspension or operating with a suspended
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
registration um where they were not you
 
02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
know committing any sort of vehicle
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
infraction that was a danger um it's
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
simply their status in that situation
 
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
because they have unfade P fines by the
 
02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
court um they then enter habitual
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
offender status and so on and becomes um
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
this uh snowball of of money owed to the
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
court not able to pay it no license
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
can't get to work and it goes on and on
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
and on um I think again going to the
 
02:29:39.269 --> 02:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
question of you know is that the
 
02:29:41.550 --> 02:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
intention of enforcing this particular
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
statute um is that what we want to be
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
doing um and I would argue there are
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
other ways to to do so the officer
 
02:29:49.389 --> 02:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
testified that you know they give
 
02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
warnings on these things all the time
 
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
you know if if an if a vehicle is
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
stopped and the um officer notices that
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
there's an inspection issue they can
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
give a warning on that um that's an
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to deal with it there's
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
other ways that can be dealt with it in
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
terms of the registration system
 
02:30:06.269 --> 02:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
although I would say I think that the
 
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor did offer to um add to the
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
list of this that it um expand to
 
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicles I would actually
 
02:30:17.309 --> 02:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
say unregistered vehicles
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
is not a safety necessarily a safety
 
02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
concern is about being able to pay the
 
02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
money um in this situation and and again
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
leading to the same types of
 
02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
consequences in fact even stronger ones
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
because um being stopped for an
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicle I believe is a
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
major motor vehicle offense and does
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
carry a much heftier fine than false
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker and so simply being
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
stopped for an unregistered vehicle I
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
would argue um you know creates these uh
 
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh issues for people without means even
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
more any questions oh one I'm sorry one
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
last thing is um oftentimes the
 
02:30:55.870 --> 02:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicle thing as well it's
 
02:30:57.389 --> 02:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to tell whose car is it
 
02:30:58.750 --> 02:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean you could be driving
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
someone's else's car who where it's
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
unregistered in that
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
situation yeah thank you representative
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
Newman so do you feel that a second uh
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
making at a secondary offense would be a
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
resolution to both an inspection issue
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
and an unregistered vehicle issue
 
02:31:21.269 --> 02:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
I think it lessens the
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
um it likely lessens the number of stops
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and and the amount of enforcement on
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
this leading to um the amount of fines
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
that are accured um and the engagement
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement in monitoring
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
basically what is inspection issues uh
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
in this situation I think that
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
um yes it would do those things I think
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to to deal with um um
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
it yes I'm sorry if you need to repeat I
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
completely Professor is it is it not
 
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
also true and it's been a number of
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
years since my college days in criminal
 
02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
justice but that Studies have shown that
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
something as simple as an inspection
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
sticker is often indicative of
 
02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
situations in that person's life or
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
things they're involved in that could
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
lead to other things for example often
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
times people are stopped from inspection
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
sticker and police have discovered
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
someone who was being held hostage in
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
the car and a battered woman was in the
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
car who was wanted to not be with that
 
02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
person uh parents who had children
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
weren't supposed to be I mean any number
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
of different crimes result from a motor
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle stop based on a a legal illegal
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
stop sure I I think that's the case
 
02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
though and as I think the sponsor said
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
any one of us when we're driving at some
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
point some officer can find a way to
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
legally pull pull us over based on the
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle laws that we have and so
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
you know if there's some intention of
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
pulling a vehicle over um they can do so
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
and having this specific Statute in here
 
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
to affect I think the very far off and I
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
would say extremely rare situation um
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
where some other very significant
 
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
violent crime is going on at the time um
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
is too remote in terms of justifying the
 
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
real cost um on this statute to uh the
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
people who are without means in this
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
state the poor citizens of New
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you representative
 
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question I
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand your
 
02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like you're saying
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the um by being by um inspection
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
being a primary reason to initiate a
 
02:33:43.469 --> 02:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
stop that the result is
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
that um people of less means people of a
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
lower class or
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
um people with financial issues are more
 
02:33:56.349 --> 02:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
likely to have protracted in
 
02:33:59.469 --> 02:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
interactions with police um more likely
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
to be investigated whereas people of
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
means are less likely to essentially end
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
up in a situation where they're being
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
investigated for anything any smell any
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
weird movements um is that kind of what
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes I mean obviously if you can afford
 
02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
inspection if you can afford to take
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
care of whatever issue your particular
 
02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
inspection agent identifies um and
 
02:34:30.990 --> 02:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
handle it and still engage in criminal
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
activities you're not going to be
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
reason thank you see no further
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:34:42.389 --> 02:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here wishing to
 
02:34:43.469 --> 02:34:43.479 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill who hasn't
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
testified so far seeing none I'm going
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
to close close the public hearing on HB
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
1061 and I'm going to we've only got two
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
bills left so I think I'm going to see
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
where this goes I'm going to open the
 
02:34:59.710 --> 02:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 1366 I know there's
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
someone here from the um fishery and
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
think thank you Mr chair um so this bill
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
does two things and I'll say at the
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
outset I generally do not like creating
 
02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
new crimes uh but part of what this bill
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
does is that um so presently um I only
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
learned this because I had a client
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
charge with it a while ago so you might
 
02:35:24.190 --> 02:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
be more familiar with the motor vehicle
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
code so under the motor vehicle code we
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
have negligent driving uh which is
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
driving vehicle negligently and for that
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's no license loss um and minimum
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
$250 fine we also have reckless driving
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
and that is driving vehicle recklessly
 
02:35:42.750 --> 02:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
um and that has mandatory license loss
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
of 60 days and also a $500 f plus
 
02:35:48.349 --> 02:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment um what's interesting
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
about both of those K charges um if
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're driving a car motor vehicle is
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're both violation level offenses
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
now when we return to our boating statue
 
02:35:59.230 --> 02:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
we have negligent operation of a boat
 
02:36:02.349 --> 02:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's a misdemeanor I suggest it is
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous or if not more
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
dangerous to drive a car in those
 
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
Fashions than it is operate a boat so I
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why it was a misdemeanor but
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get more in line with the
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle code um particularly for
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
negligent operations so of the two
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
negligent operation is lesser
 
02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
culpability than Reckless operation so I
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
think at a minimum that should be a
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
violation level offense so um the first
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
part of what my bill does is brings it
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
from Mis miror down to violation but the
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
second thing is there's no Reckless
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
operation of boats under present statue
 
02:36:35.269 --> 02:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
so this would create that um Bill
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
tracking our motor vehicle code um just
 
02:36:40.269 --> 02:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
applying it to boats and I'm keeping
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
that a misdemeanor um even though in the
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
car side it's still a violation level
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
offense so I I be fine with both of them
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
being violation level offense but one of
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
the things that I think it makes sense
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
for it to be a misdemeanor is it's sort
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
of a compromise this original Bill did
 
02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
have a misdemeanor offense level so if
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
someone is operating recklessly boat
 
02:37:02.269 --> 02:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
fine that can stay misdemeanor but also
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
under our criminal code it's a felony to
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
operate or commit um Reckless conduct
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
using a dangerous or deadly weapon and
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
courts have said Vehicles can be a
 
02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon so some departments in my
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh opinion uh I guess over prosecute
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
certain cases does tend to be the
 
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
extreme ones of reckless driving and
 
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
bringing as a felony so I was hopeful
 
02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
that there's this misdemeanor approach
 
02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
that people won't be charged with
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
felonies for voting um so it's um I'm
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
hoping this bill or that's what this
 
02:37:37.150 --> 02:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
bill um does and hoping it'll go through
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you well
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
stand by represent Murray has a
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I'm just
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
reading where it says that a violation
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
of The Reckless operation of boats will
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
include a loss of a person's driver's
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
license for 60 days and the privilege of
 
02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
operating a boat I'm wondering if the
 
02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
reverse is true like if you get arrested
 
02:38:09.269 --> 02:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
for recklessly driving would you lose
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
your boat
 
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
license or there is no I don't believe
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
so someone from State might be able to
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
correct me New Hampshire is a weird in
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion way to we don't really have
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
boting license we have like boter safety
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
cards um certificates other states we
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
can use I happen to have a California
 
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
one because it's super easy to get
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
California one um but I think generally
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
just ironic but generally I would say no
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong um however if you're
 
02:38:37.950 --> 02:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
convicted of DWI in this state um
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
specifically you lose your voting
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
license for a year even if it's driving
 
02:38:42.910 --> 02:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
more vehicle so since that's
 
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
specifically in the statute um I would
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
think this doesn't do that but I I could
 
02:38:47.279 --> 02:38:48.710 align:start position:0%
think this doesn't do that but I I could
be

02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you see no further questions
 
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
donlevy good afternoon the chairman
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the criminal
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
justice committee my name is Tim Dunley
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
I am the retired captain of the Marine
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
Patrol unit for the Department of Safety
 
02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
and I still work part-time uh handling
 
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
some legislative issues and and here I
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
am today thank you um we come today to
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill um as
 
02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard previously We have dealt
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
with just this one charge of careless
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
and negligent operation for years and
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
we've had to juggle What charges were
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh because this was the only
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
statute we had on the books often times
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
we were Tak taking less serious non-m
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor type of uh offenses charging
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
them with careless and negligent at the
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
time of the the court hearing we would
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
reduce them to the violation before the
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
court obviously we've tied up court
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a misdemeanor criminal
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
offense criminal record people were
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
bringing it that far into the system
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
this now provides the officer uh and the
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
courts with the option to come in with a
 
02:40:13.950 --> 02:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
more appropriate charge particularly
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with the Lesser
 
02:40:15.279 --> 02:40:16.230 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with the Lesser
offense

02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
but it also gives us the tool to use
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
should the actions of a boat operator
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
rise to the level that should be a
 
02:40:24.830 --> 02:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
misdem charge and is reckless with that
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
culpability in
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
mind uh the one issue that I will point
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
out with the language that's been
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
submitted before you today while we
 
02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:34.870 align:start position:0%
submitted before you today while we
agree

02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
100% and this was just brought up um
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
when penalties cross over to motor
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle and back we have found um that
 
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
there is a manipulation of the system on
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
the boat suspension where defendants
 
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:54.279 align:start position:0%
will ensure that their suspension of 60
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
days in this case will take effect in
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
December January February because their
 
02:41:02.429 --> 02:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
suspension becomes meaningless the lakes
 
02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
of Frozen that is the case that happened
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh many years ago with the Boating well
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
intoxicated statutes and the driving
 
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
well intoxicated statutes there was an a
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
a significant effort made to make sure
 
02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
that suspension never impacted them uh
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
by the by simply the timing of when the
 
02:41:23.309 --> 02:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
conviction took place in the
 
02:41:25.870 --> 02:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
courts so you folks in your wisdom
 
02:41:28.110 --> 02:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
changed that to losing the Boating
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
privilege for one calendar year
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of when the conviction took
 
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
place they were losing it for one
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
boating season which for the typical
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
recreational boating season we're
 
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
talking Memorial Day to Labor Day about
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
95 days so well I'm not here to say that
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the suspension should be 95 days I just
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
caution that the 60-day suspension
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
depending upon the timing of the
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding in the courts may be a mood
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
issue aside from that we we come
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill and I'm here to
 
02:42:02.269 --> 02:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:06.269 --> 02:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
have thank you um if if the bill were
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
indicate the follow a year would you be
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
in support of them we would be we'd be
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
support if it's your wishes to keep it
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
at 60 days we would support that um
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps if it were 60 days between the
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
mo you know the days of May 1st to
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
September 1st what problems or issues
 
02:42:34.150 --> 02:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
that poses the court to implement that
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
suspension perhaps six months down the
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
road taking effect I don't know the
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
impacts of that sir thank you further
 
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative sing thank you
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
so much and thank thank you for taking
 
02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
my question um where do you see the
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
majority of um negligent and Reckless
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
operation boats um we find that often
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
times when there has been a boating
 
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
accident where personal injury uh is the
 
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
result the operator may not have been
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
impaired but may have been on a cell
 
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
phone or operating at a speed uh much uh
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
faster than they should have been too
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
close to Shore or around public docks uh
 
02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances like that
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um I guess I I should
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
have been more specific are you seeing
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
this more like Lakeside ocean I know we
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that much beachr 19 uh miles
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
but um are you seeing this more in our
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
Lakes regions versus our our ocean SE
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
sectors or we see it we see
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
it um on all our Inland Waters I I'll
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
stop short of calling it regularly but
 
02:43:42.030 --> 02:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
often uh but on our Sea Coast for
 
02:43:44.429 --> 02:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
example uh the one time one that comes
 
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
to mind for me was uh a gentleman who
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
had an autopilot an auton navigating
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
system on uh their vessel went down in
 
02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
the birth and went to sleep and the boat
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
went into Ry Harbor and bounced off
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
three or four boats causing damage um so
 
02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
there's a circumstance where we brought
 
02:44:02.429 --> 02:44:02.439 align:start position:0%
careless and negligent operation forward
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
as the misdemeanor likely deserving um
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
so it happens on the saltwater as
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
well and for the committee's
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
clarification the difference between um
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
negligent and Reckless is mostly intent
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
is is that is that correct in other
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
words I intend to race you that's
 
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
reckless versus I took a nap and my boat
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
crashed is negligence right it's it's
 
02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's that culpability is is the term
 
02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you certainly see no further
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your teson thank
 
02:44:34.510 --> 02:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
you all for your
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
time anyone
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
else um before I gavel this closed I
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
want to have a quick moment with
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:45:00.469 align:start position:0%
want to have a quick moment with
minority

02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
if the sponsors of wishes we would be
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
inclined to EXA this with the OTP if you
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
go get an amendment that fixes that 60
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
days so it takes period between May and
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
September we will take a a one hour
 
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
break and give you the time to go get it
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could just ask so you
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
would want it may through September May
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
1st through September well just make it
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh Memorial dat of Labor Day of the
 
02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
following year then or yeah the date of
 
02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
well no from if it occurs during a
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
boting season any period that's still
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
left would roll over to the next year so
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you only have 30 days left in the
 
02:45:36.269 --> 02:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
Boating season the first 30 days of the
 
02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
next boating season you'd still be
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
suspended otherwise you it's just
 
02:45:42.429 --> 02:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
throwaway and you don't get suspended at
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
all I believe so like if you got 10 10
 
02:45:46.510 --> 02:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
days left in the
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
season um it have to carry over
 
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't have the effect
 
02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
yes I just feel like getting something
 
02:45:56.670 --> 02:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
done but unless you guys want to
 
02:45:59.349 --> 02:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
leave yeah you know what um
 
02:46:00.910 --> 02:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
Representative sitech makes a good point
 
02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
um we'll we'll um we'll take this up
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
actually I can't I have to do it today
 
02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise I have to schedule it and
 
02:46:10.590 --> 02:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
notice it so just as quick as you can
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
we'll be I'll ask everyone to stay close
 
02:46:15.070 --> 02:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
by um take 30 minutes everyone and then
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
start heading back here so that if he
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
gets back early enough we can take this
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
up and get out of here we are on uh
 
02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:22.070 align:start position:0%
up and get out of here we are on uh
break

02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
break
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.030 --> 02:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
minutes stand by everybody everyone
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
stand by everybody stand by I uh I
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize we had one left to do
 
02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
while we were doing that um so um
 
02:46:52.030 --> 02:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
second you were so close guys
 
02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:13.910 align:start position:0%
second you were so close guys
sorry

02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:48:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm open in public hearing on hp1 1448
 
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
um the committee is uh GNA get that
 
02:48:37.550 --> 02:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
men thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
everyone for a long day um hopefully a
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
spill will be quick as well um so under
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
present law when someone's charged with
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
um generally a DWI um or specifically in
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
this statute DWI um if the court or if
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
during the course of that case their
 
02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
blood is drawn what happens is the off
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
or photus draws the blood gives the
 
02:48:58.910 --> 02:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
blood to the officer the officer submits
 
02:49:00.670 --> 02:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
it to the crime lab the crime lab and
 
02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
their infinite slowness months down the
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
road um analyzes that sample and
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
eventually gets that sample to the
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
defense layer now based on that sample
 
02:49:12.190 --> 02:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
the defense lawyer may or may not want
 
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
to get that blood tested however the
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
statute say says presently that after
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
that sample is done tested by the lab
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
they only retain it for a period of 30
 
02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
days needless to say cases are not
 
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
closed in 30 days I wish they were
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
coures are cases are incredibly slow um
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
so often
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
times I think it's just ridiculous that
 
02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
the state is destroying evidence in the
 
02:49:38.349 --> 02:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
middle of the case and that the
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has authorized them to do
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
that if this statute weren't there I
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't think any state lab would would
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
destroy evidence in the middle of the
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
case I would point out that it's a
 
02:49:49.990 --> 02:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
felony to actually destroy evidence in
 
02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
the case I've told the lab they are
 
02:49:54.269 --> 02:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
committing a felony by doing this you'll
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
say they did not change their policy um
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
but I think it's just absolutely
 
02:49:59.229 --> 02:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that blood in the middle of a
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
case is being destroyed by the crime lab
 
02:50:03.309 --> 02:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
If This Were a rape case the lab
 
02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be DNA testing stuff say ah we
 
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
test it and then we destroyed it after
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
30 days that's just absolutely
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
ridiculous they would be holding on to
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
that evidence this evidence could be
 
02:50:15.389 --> 02:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
potentially exculpatory the reason it's
 
02:50:17.309 --> 02:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
saved is so that the defense if they
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
want can get it independently tested um
 
02:50:22.110 --> 02:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
our whole implied consent statute deals
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
with independent tests the defendant um
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
under the right before they're asked to
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
if they want to give a blood test or
 
02:50:31.150 --> 02:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
refuse unless it's a felony case where
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's forced they are told you have a
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
right to get a sample of this tested at
 
02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
your own expense that is meaningless if
 
02:50:42.229 --> 02:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
the lab is actually destroying the
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
sample before the person gets around to
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
testing it now if someone hired a lawyer
 
02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
early on in the process I know that the
 
02:50:50.469 --> 02:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
lab has the blood and at some point is
 
02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
going to send the results to me or the
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
defendant um generally speaking there's
 
02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
not an issue with that um at some point
 
02:51:01.389 --> 02:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
I get it but it's possible that that
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
notice doesn't arrive particularly when
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's like six months down the road and
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
no one followed up to get it but I think
 
02:51:09.750 --> 02:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
what's more common is that someone who
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a lawyer right away CU they
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
don't need a lawyer right away the blood
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
samp out and depending on that sample if
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
it comes back essentially zero nothing
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the blood the police are going to or
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
the prosecutors just going to flat out
 
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
dismi that DWI um but if it comes back
 
02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
above the legal limit then that's when a
 
02:51:30.229 --> 02:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
charge might be brought so at that point
 
02:51:32.429 --> 02:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
the person might get a lawyer M way
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
which is z Gil or they might wait a
 
02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
while I've had cases where numerous
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
cases where someone retained me after
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that 30 days is up uh now the lab they
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
don't exactly destroy it on the 31st day
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
they just go through Reg regularly
 
02:51:47.469 --> 02:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
destroying samples so sometimes might be
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
closer 30 days I had cases where 90 days
 
02:51:51.550 --> 02:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
later I requested it hoping they still
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
have it sometimes they do sometimes they
 
02:51:55.469 --> 02:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
don't but eventually that CA that blood
 
02:51:58.349 --> 02:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
is destroyed while a case is still open
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
and once it's destroyed I can't get it
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
independently tested so what this does
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
is this bill says stop destroying
 
02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
evidence while a case is open and
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
specifically requires basically the
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or a court to tell them to
 
02:52:15.630 --> 02:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
destroy it um now when I looked at the
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note of this and how it came out
 
02:52:20.670 --> 02:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
to $70,000 a year I'm guessing those are
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
those magical $70,000 hammers that the
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
US federal government buys this is not
 
02:52:28.349 --> 02:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
that costly for the state to implement
 
02:52:29.710 --> 02:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
so there's two parts of it guess they
 
02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
would need more refrigerators um so the
 
02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
samples are generally stored in a
 
02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
refrigerator there would need some more
 
02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
refrigerators um but the State Labs
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
already retaining the blood by the time
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
they get it tested we're generally
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
talking 3 to six months after the case
 
02:52:46.269 --> 02:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
has been initiated now I'd say like 80%
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the cases are either going to be
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
resolved in that time frame or a few
 
02:52:52.590 --> 02:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
months afterwards so the defendant wants
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
Cas is resolved as soon as possible um
 
02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
often times in blood cases I'm just
 
02:52:58.590 --> 02:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
waiting on those results to finalize the
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
case with the prosecutor so often cases
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
have to keep being pushed out until the
 
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
results come in but I want the results
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible um and as soon as it
 
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
comes in a lot of times cases get
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
resolved particularly if the blood is
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
Extreme one way or the other um high or
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
low for whatever substance they're
 
02:53:17.710 --> 02:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
testing so I don't think it's going to
 
02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
extend the lab actually holding samples
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
for a whole lot longer it might be
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
double instead of them having the sample
 
02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:26.439 align:start position:0%
for 3 to six months maybe now they'll
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
have it six months to a year uh but
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to indefinitely have
 
02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
it cases are going to resolve and at
 
02:53:33.469 --> 02:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
some point a prosecutor or Court's going
 
02:53:34.990 --> 02:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
to submit a motion saying hey you can
 
02:53:37.950 --> 02:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
destroy us the case is ended um so
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's the issue with the present statue
 
02:53:41.630 --> 02:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
um this is my solution to fix it I'm
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:46.070 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
questions

02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative what um what if if
 
02:53:51.229 --> 02:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know um what other states do with
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
regard to the blood sample um storage
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
time period I haven't looked at it just
 
02:53:59.710 --> 02:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
when I first saw a statue I'm like I'm
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
just surprised it's there at all I I
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
think it's an issue and I think in
 
02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
certain cases courts will dismiss things
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
so on appeal one of the best ways to get
 
02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
a case reversed is um when exculpatory
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
evidence wasn't provided so
 
02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know specifically about
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
DWI cases I'll say this is the DWI
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
exception to the Constitution so there's
 
02:54:23.710 --> 02:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of them this is one of them um but
 
02:54:26.190 --> 02:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
if we think of it for other cases why is
 
02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
the state who's in possession of the
 
02:54:29.309 --> 02:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
evidence in the case destroying it in
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
the middle of the case um I think it's
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
just absurd they're doing it for money I
 
02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a whole lot of money at
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the day money is not a good
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
enough reason especially when it's not a
 
02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
lot to deprive someone of their due
 
02:54:46.670 --> 02:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
process right and and then blood is
 
02:54:48.429 --> 02:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
going to be the strongest evidence in a
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
DWI case most times and it could be the
 
02:54:55.469 --> 02:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:58.630 --> 02:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
not what what other things have you you
 
02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
changed I see that there's more here
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
than just requiring them to keep it what
 
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
added I don't believe anything it just
 
02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
says when it requires them to keep it
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
and paragraph the new paragraph for just
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
says how they or when and how they go
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
about um not having to keep it anymore
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it deals with um saying they should
 
02:55:25.469 --> 02:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
preserve it until has received notice
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
from the relevant
 
02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um that they don't need to
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
keep it anymore so it's more of a I
 
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
guess procedural mechanism but basically
 
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
this says you have to keep it until an
 
02:55:38.349 --> 02:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate time that you're notified
 
02:55:40.750 --> 02:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
you can destroy
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
it represent

02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:48.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:55:48.190 --> 02:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you than for taking my
 
02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
question are you aware if the uh the
 
02:55:56.349 --> 02:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
state lab seeks a uh judge's order to
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
destroy it or if they automatically
 
02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
destroy it by policy or do they do both
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
they automatically destroy it by policy
 
02:56:04.429 --> 02:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
um so their policy is 30 days like said
 
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
my experience they just go through when
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're full and just clear out older
 
02:56:10.510 --> 02:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
stuff first um so it tends to be 90 days
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
or not and I expect that's that is
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
specific to DWI blood cases I don't know
 
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
in a drug case so I mean in a drug
 
02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
possession case I believe the lab is
 
02:56:22.830 --> 02:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
just saving that throughout the entire
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
course of the case like I think they
 
02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
should so it's just these DWI cases that
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
have the exception that they're
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
destroying it um so my bill would allow
 
02:56:33.469 --> 02:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
them to destroy it when the prosecutor
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
or Court gives them an order saying you
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
should do this um so me at the end of
 
02:56:39.229 --> 02:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
the day yes the local department or
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
state police after the case is resolved
 
02:56:42.510 --> 02:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
should be sending a letter to the lab
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
saying hey this case is resolved you can
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
get rid of the evidence and departments
 
02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
do that all the time with evidence so
 
02:56:51.150 --> 02:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
like I said the state lab doesn't just
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
do this um departments hold evidence for
 
02:56:54.990 --> 02:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
a while and ultimately when they want to
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
destroy it um it's either by agreement
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
or they file a motion with the court for
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
destroying the evidence um and it hasn't
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
been a problem it's not going to be some
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
magical problem for the state to just
 
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
keep the sample for a little longer
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:11.710 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Newman

02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
Su yes thank you for uh for taking this
 
02:57:18.229 --> 02:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
question in looking through the um the
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal node and then the
 
02:57:23.229 --> 02:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
methodology what jumped out at me was
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
the um the investment in freestanding
 
02:57:29.910 --> 02:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
walk-in freezers and the space the
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
adequate space to accommodate them do
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
you have any creative thoughts
 
02:57:39.229 --> 02:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
on where that space could be found so I
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone from the lab I tend
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
to just by guessing I think they're
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
going to need double the amount of
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
freezers um so I don't know how many
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
they presently have or how big their
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
space is um but this says the cost of
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
each freezer is approximately
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
$10,000 I agree with that for them to
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
saying they need to store it for three
 
02:57:57.710 --> 02:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
years I don't know where they're com
 
02:57:58.830 --> 02:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
coming up with that number no
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor case is going three years
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
certainly the average isn't three years
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
maybe there's an outlier particular in a
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
felony case um so I mean the the crime
 
02:58:11.309 --> 02:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
lab they have all sorts of evidence they
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
hold a lot of things that are
 
02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
particularly much bigger they're able to
 
02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
come up with storage I mean we're
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
talking about small blood samples yes
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
they have to be refrigerated so that
 
02:58:20.830 --> 02:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
blood doesn't spoil U so there's some
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
electricity cost um so I agree there is
 
02:58:27.309 --> 02:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
some but um I just think the uh numbers
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
are highly
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
inflated thank
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:38.190 --> 02:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
Newman to go along with whether they can
 
02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
store it or not
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
um who has access do the labs have
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
access to know could could you put
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
language in there that would say 30 days
 
02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
as long as there is no continuing um
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
case involved the the problem is the lab
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
would then have to regularly follow up
 
02:59:02.670 --> 02:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
with every Department to see if there
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
was a change I think that would be
 
02:59:07.070 --> 02:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
highly expensive so I mean the much
 
02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper way is the police department
 
02:59:10.990 --> 02:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
knows the progress of their case when
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
the case is resolved all they have to do
 
02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
is send a letter to lab saying you can
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
now represent B this proposal seems very
 
02:59:24.670 --> 02:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
very pricey um would would it be
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
possible for the attorneys to to notify
 
02:59:29.190 --> 02:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
the state labs and just say you could
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
just would that to me would seem quicker
 
02:59:36.150 --> 02:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
and less expensive than all of this
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I do in every case I have the
 
02:59:40.309 --> 02:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem is people don't hire attorneys a
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
lot of time or they wait to see what the
 
02:59:43.950 --> 02:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
outcome is or they hire us when it's is
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
too late so I think even one lost thing
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
is just not right I mean it's costly to
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
obtain or store evidence but that's the
 
02:59:57.469 --> 02:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
cost of our Criminal Justice System our
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
DWI when someone's found guilty it has a
 
03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory fine I mean pres that's going
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the state um I think the money is
 
03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
there um I don't think it's a huge cost
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
but even so people have a right to
 
03:00:11.950 --> 03:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence as a reminder to
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
the committee um we have the luxury of
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
not worrying about the money we that's
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
for finance we just worry about the
 
03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
policy so if we like the policy we let
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
them try to figure out how to pay for it
 
03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
um representative U roads thank you Mr
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
question I think I just need
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
clarification to make sure I'm
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
understanding this
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
correctly are you saying that evidence
 
03:00:41.150 --> 03:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
is thrown away destroyed before the case
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
is closed is that what I'm hearing like
 
03:00:45.269 --> 03:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
over and over with all these yes
 
03:00:48.910 --> 03:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions wow thank
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
you I'll just follow up when I request a
 
03:00:53.790 --> 03:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
letter or when I send the letter to the
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
lab and they don't have anymore they
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
will say that it was destroyed usually
 
03:00:58.950 --> 03:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
ask when it's destroy when it was
 
03:01:01.030 --> 03:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
destroyed they'll tell me but yes they
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
destroy evidence during a
 
03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
destroy evidence during a
case

03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:15.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:18.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:01:18.269 --> 03:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
wheeler my apologies to my friend
 
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative Stone he has but um but
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
I'll take it though um representative
 
03:01:26.750 --> 03:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hines thank you and thank you Mr
 
03:01:29.070 --> 03:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so I guess to expand off of
 
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
Representative Road's question um what
 
03:01:34.030 --> 03:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
is the reason that the courts give you
 
03:01:35.710 --> 03:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
as an attorney as to why they're
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
destroying uh these blood
 
03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
samples it's not the court giving me the
 
03:01:43.229 --> 03:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
reason it's the dep part or the labor
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
crime land try not to cast any
 
03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:47.229 align:start position:0%
crime land try not to cast any
dispersions

03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
dispersions
 
03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
on they will tell us they will tell me
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the statute says we destroy him after 30
 
03:01:53.429 --> 03:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
days that's their reason um underlying
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's because of money but there's space
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
time but they're following the
 
03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
law thank you represent Stone thank you
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
real quick just for clarification this
 
03:02:06.510 --> 03:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
would also apply to felony level offense
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
dwi's Mr meor level offense DWIs for the
 
03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:12.550 align:start position:0%
dwi's Mr meor level offense DWIs for the
30-day

03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
hold

03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
hold
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
I would say yes because it's in the DWI
 
03:02:19.389 --> 03:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
statute to 265a is the whole DWI statute
 
03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
so the felony DWI is when someone causes
 
03:02:23.469 --> 03:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
a serious bodily injury so that's where
 
03:02:26.110 --> 03:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
there's Force blood draws um so I
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
believe the I mean this references the
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
whole statute and I don't think there's
 
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
an exception so I doubt I'm wrong but I
 
03:02:35.469 --> 03:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
would say yes it playes so for followup
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
that would be indicative of a case
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
lasting more than your typical 90 to 120
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
days for a felony level offense y um so
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
those cases are rare thank F so it's
 
03:02:46.110 --> 03:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
when someone caused serious body injury
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
to another and then the blood was drawn
 
03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes those cases do last longer um
 
03:02:54.429 --> 03:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
ironically have had Superior Court cases
 
03:02:57.790 --> 03:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
be quicker than district court cases um
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
they do last longer um so I would think
 
03:03:02.670 --> 03:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
those cases again they make
 
03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
up I would guess at most 10% of the
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
blood and that's really high I think
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 5% or less um but yeah
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
just on average I would guess double the
 
03:03:12.750 --> 03:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time that they would have to
 
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
um one last question I have is have you
 
03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
had any in other words if they destroy
 
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
the blood and you make a motion to have
 
03:03:29.070 --> 03:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
your client's blood tested and their
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
answer is we destroyed it are you
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
successfully able to get the case kicked
 
03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that they've destroyed
 
03:03:37.269 --> 03:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
the evidence or is the court basically
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
saying not too bad it's gone thankfully
 
03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
I've never had to litigate it the last
 
03:03:43.469 --> 03:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
time I had this happen um spefic
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
specifically what happened is apparently
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the police department said we notified
 
03:03:50.269 --> 03:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
the client client didn't acknowledge
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
notification or for whatever reason
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
didn't get notification and then the
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
Department's opinion was well they
 
03:03:57.070 --> 03:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
should have known the blood was drawn
 
03:03:58.349 --> 03:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
this was a weird case where someone was
 
03:03:59.630 --> 03:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
hospitalized didn't actually know their
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
blood was drawn so they weren't even
 
03:04:03.790 --> 03:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
looking out for this letter um but after
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
bringing uh the issue to the attention
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the prosecutor the case was favorably
 
03:04:10.030 --> 03:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
resolved by plea so I haven't actually
 
03:04:12.150 --> 03:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
had to litigate it um surprised it
 
03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't been litigated yet
 
03:04:16.229 --> 03:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
um I think it's because lawyers know as
 
03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
soon as someone's blood drawn is I don't
 
03:04:19.950 --> 03:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
wait for the result I tell the lab don't
 
03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
destroy the blood um the other issue is
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
the lab does tell me so they'll hold if
 
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't actually test the blood yet
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
they will wait till the blood's test and
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
then they'll hold it until me I have to
 
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
pick it up within 30 days that's
 
03:04:32.229 --> 03:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable like I don't want them
 
03:04:34.030 --> 03:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
storing it forever when I know they have
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
it and I'm trying to get
 
03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh representative
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
n thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
03:04:46.429 --> 03:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
we've you've talked about how the policy
 
03:04:49.269 --> 03:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
of um you know the policy is 30 days um
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
and this would be changing it to ensure
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
that it was for the that would be the
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
statute um but further back as we were
 
03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the fiscal note and things
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
like that and um uh how the state
 
03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
police um estimated the cost and things
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
like that what they say at the end of
 
03:05:08.190 --> 03:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
this is alternatively the department of
 
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh the department states that it could
 
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh return such blood samples to the
 
03:05:13.550 --> 03:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
submitting agencies for storage so that
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
is um a a means by which it would not be
 
03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
a concentrated expense in that way I
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
guess what my question is your that's
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
not explicitly stated as a statute and
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
so would that be policy that would be up
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
to um the uh State Police or Department
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
of Safety yeah so I guess I would leave
 
03:05:37.630 --> 03:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
that up to whoever does those
 
03:05:39.229 --> 03:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rules I think that is an
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
approach they could send it back um I
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't think the towns will like that
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
very much I think it's a lot easier to
 
03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
have all this blood in one specific spot
 
03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh but I I suppose that is a approach I
 
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
would suspect that might be an unfunded
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
mandate on on the towns um thank you
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
though um seeing nothing further thank
 
03:06:00.030 --> 03:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony um and
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
Staples

03:06:15.630 --> 03:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:17.550 --> 03:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Melissa
 
03:06:19.269 --> 03:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
Staples I'm the director of the New
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police forensic forensic
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
laboratory so I'm happy to be here to
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer some questions you may have and
 
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
have been raised about this particular
 
03:06:29.229 --> 03:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
legislative um
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
Bill the I'm happy that the sponsor
 
03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
explained the 30-day policy as far as uh
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of that being that the
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
subject of the testing would have the
 
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity once they are apprised of
 
03:06:43.870 --> 03:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
their results to pick up a sample of the
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
blood to have tested at the laboratory
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
of their choosing I think the 30-day
 
03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
time frame uh probably came out of the
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
process because that states that upon
 
03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
receipt of the report of their results
 
03:07:01.630 --> 03:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
the subject has 30 days to requested
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
hearing uh an ALS hearing through that
 
03:07:05.950 --> 03:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
process and I'm I'm I think this
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
probably was designed to mimic that it
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
sounds very simple uh just send an email
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
to the lab and they can destroy the when
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
the case is done uh the laboratory gets
 
03:07:19.150 --> 03:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
around 2,000 blood samples a year and
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
these prosecutors are Prosecuting not
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
just blood samples but in toxil lier
 
03:07:24.910 --> 03:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
cases they're very
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
busy they will not send these emails I
 
03:07:29.590 --> 03:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
have a whole Warehouse of evidence of
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
drugs and guns and homicide evidence
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I wish I had an email from the
 
03:07:34.429 --> 03:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
attorney saying it's okay to get rid of
 
03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
these things now so the reality of this
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that we're looking at long-term
 
03:07:41.229 --> 03:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
storage um because I also don't have
 
03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
resources to find out who's Prosecuting
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
the case we don't have that information
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
the status of the case we also don't
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
have that information and so there's no
 
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
way for the laboratory to seek this out
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh to proactively try to get this this
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
approval from the attorneys to destroy
 
03:08:00.510 --> 03:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
the Bloods so that's where the fiscal
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
impact comes in this truly is becoming a
 
03:08:05.550 --> 03:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
long-term storage issue uh the
 
03:08:06.990 --> 03:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
laboratory would require walk-in
 
03:08:09.389 --> 03:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
freezers every so many years to continue
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
to store Bloods long term uh we do not
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
have space for these freezers uh in fact
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
A needs assessment performed in 2018
 
03:08:18.830 --> 03:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
determined at that time the laboratory
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
was 2 and a half times undersized for
 
03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
the people we have and what we're
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
providing the
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
services I think that uh we could um
 
03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
without any fiscal impact uh store the
 
03:08:35.590 --> 03:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
blood samples for six months uh and my
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
understanding from the sponsor's
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
testimony was that most cases resolved
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
within 3 to six months and extending the
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
time period that's on line four from 30
 
03:08:45.870 --> 03:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
days to something more like six months
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh or even nine months whatever you feel
 
03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:48.469 align:start position:0%
uh or even nine months whatever you feel
if

03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:08:51.790 --> 03:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
you're inclined to do so uh would allow
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
for that time period to be extended and
 
03:08:56.110 --> 03:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
we have current facilities to store the
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
blood samples for that period of time
 
03:08:59.229 --> 03:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
and so the fiscal impact of that would
 
03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
be zero um so hopefully that might be
 
03:09:03.790 --> 03:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
something the sponsor may want to
 
03:09:05.070 --> 03:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
consider or the committee may want to
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
consider as an alternative that's
 
03:09:10.429 --> 03:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
feasible and may accomplish the same
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
goal I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:09:15.389 --> 03:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
that you have thank you
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative Stone thank you
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
03:09:21.389 --> 03:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
something like 90 days would be
 
03:09:23.550 --> 03:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable for not having an impact
 
03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
fiscally I would go as long as six
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
months up to six months without any
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
Financial impact with no Financial
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Miss Staples
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
um you said that the attorneys are so
 
03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
busy they won't even send you an email
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
for some some of the other uh evidence
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
that you have locked up would that be
 
03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
something that you would like address by
 
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature as well a little oomph
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
to the County attorneys to get them to
 
03:09:55.630 --> 03:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
well what we do and this was mentioned
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
earlier is evidence in in all this this
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
cases that we test do get returned to
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
the submitting agency and so that would
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
be an alternative um because the the
 
03:10:06.550 --> 03:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill just says whoever's storing it
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
needs to store it until they receive
 
03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
notice uh the submitting agencies are
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
certainly more familiar with who
 
03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
precuing the case and what the status is
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
than we are so that is an alternative
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
and all the other evidence that we test
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's submitted by local agencies does
 
03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
get returned to them for final
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
disposition the samples that we are
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
storing longterm uh representative
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
wheeler are drug cases submitted by
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
State Police uh Firearms submitted by
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
State Police and homicide evidence which
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
usually is investigated by the major
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
crime unit of State Police so those are
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
all specific to State Police cases that
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
we end up storing long term uh it's it's
 
03:10:44.670 --> 03:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult especially for the
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
homicide evidence um because those need
 
03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
to be destroyed through having a court
 
03:10:52.030 --> 03:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
order which requires an attorney uh
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
usually had the Attorney General's
 
03:10:55.630 --> 03:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
office assistance uh to to get that
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
process and it is just very difficult I
 
03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
mean we're all busy we all have limited
 
03:11:01.630 --> 03:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
resources and so we we try to pick away
 
03:11:04.110 --> 03:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
at it um usually the drugs are a little
 
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
bit easier we can get trooper approval
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we get a court order to destroy
 
03:11:11.309 --> 03:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
those um so it's a process I guess is in
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
short it's a process
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at whether I am able to
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
add some resources to our evidence
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
control unit to try to pursue the
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
destruction of those things um because
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
we are running out of space um so you
 
03:11:25.349 --> 03:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
need to keep on top of it we get rid of
 
03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
one homicide case and another one comes
 
03:11:29.070 --> 03:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
in you know so it's a it's a constant
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
challenge um that we're dealing with
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent shy thank you Mr
 
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
chair can we have a field
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
trip I'm sure we could arrange something
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely you just want to go to that
 
03:11:46.030 --> 03:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
that giant
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
Warehouse that nobody looks like Raiders
 
03:11:50.190 --> 03:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
at a lost AR I don't sometimes you don't
 
03:11:52.349 --> 03:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
want to see what in
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
there um any further
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions but seeing none thank you for
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.510 --> 03:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
much did you need to ask something oh
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay um so does that mean we're done Mr
 
03:12:12.429 --> 03:12:12.439 align:start position:0%

will we're going to um we discussed it

and we're going to add that nine months

that sounds like a good bill and we're
 
03:12:34.469 --> 03:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
going to see if we can pass that
 
03:12:41.309 --> 03:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
