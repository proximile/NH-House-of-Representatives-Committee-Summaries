that we're on on the same page and and I
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
was uh Happ to ask our support staff our

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we uh to help us as
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
well so that being
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
said what uh let's start our discussion
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
what comments do do our members have
 
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank everybody for
 
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
their their work and and trying to
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
resolve this um so we we're looking at
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if we could speak to
 
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 align:start position:0%
um someone from each side uh to see
 
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
where they agree my understanding is
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
there are some issues of agreement and
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
where it stands out that there's not the
 
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
agreement and that's something that
 
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have to uh peel the onion on and
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
see where where we slide with that so I
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if uh uh Miss s uh if you
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
could come up to explain your well
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually it be the chairman to call you
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
up uh and and somebody else from uh the
 
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.990 align:start position:0%
up uh and and somebody else from uh the
other

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
negotiators it's up to CH well yeah we
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
want Cooperative collaboration so both
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
would do we need another seat need
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
another seat
 
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
too good afternoon um thank you for the
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here today and thank
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
you for the work that you're doing on
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
this um I guess i' I'd like to St start
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
by saying that um I'm Marsha sink excuse
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
me CEO of kaso New Hampshire um that
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been a lot of good work
 
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten done over the past
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
several weeks um at your at your
 
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion um chairman McMahon and um we
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
came to consensus on many things um but
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
there were a few obstacles that got in
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
the way of us being in complete um
 
00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
completely on board with each other
 
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
other's ideas uh suggestions and
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the change to the
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
statute so um I just wanted to start by
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
saying that that um I think there are
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
people that put in a tremendous amount
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
of work I know there were people that
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
put in a tremendous amount of work um I
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
think the challenge for us was the
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
actual implementation of what some of
 
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
what has been um uh suggested by uh by
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
the folks um under the um just G R Jr BG
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
um group sorry um and I just know them
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
by their first names primarily so um but
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
that just without the Court's
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
involvement in this process more more um
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
heavily involved and that of
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
DCF um that those are the folks that are
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
really going to be the ones in charge of
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
of making all of this happen for our
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
kids and the courts so that's when we I
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
think in the end decided that we
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't be in agreement with everything
 
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to go back to what we had
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
offered last uh last session was just
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
that minimal change to uh the child
 
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
protection statute that opens the
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for discre the discretion of
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
the court to appoint an attorney at any
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
stage of the proceedings the way it
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
currently reads now is we are um we are
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
limited to when that request can be made
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
and um it's typically made by the
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
guardian at lium this offers the
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for any party um to request
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
it and at any point in those proceedings
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
so that a child who um maybe at the
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
dispositional phase it was didn't think
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
we needed an attorney but further on in
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
the proceedings at a review hearing or
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
um you know if the child was in
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
residential placement and things like
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
that and it was extending in time that
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
the request for an attorney technically
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
could not be made although some of our
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
judges have felt it was critically
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
important that they do um that they do
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
make that appointment at a different
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
point in the hearing uh this allows
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
allows them the opportunity again it
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
just broadens that and that so we went
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
back to that original language because
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
we couldn't come to full agreement on
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other pieces I guess is the
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
fair way to present it um but um before
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
having just a clarification Miss sink
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
and appreciate you sending out the email
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
this morning yes comment that uh struck
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
out with me I wanted to just get your
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
guidance for all of us here where um it
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
stated in on the in the email that DCF
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
and the Judiciary were not part of the
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
discussions regarding the proposed
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
language that now that being said is
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
there not inherent conflict then on what
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
would be recommended as it goes through
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
the quote process that if they weren't
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
given if I mean that those two entities
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
weren't given the voice as part of this
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
that we there would be a challenge in
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
having it
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
supported go ahead it's our
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Judiciary does
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
not weigh in on policy uh but that we
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was important from an
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint not necessar
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the division we know often does not
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
take a position on certain legislation
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
but the we do think it's critically
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
important for both the Judiciary and DCF
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
to at least talk us through how this
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
would work administ atively um I think
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
on the specifically with the legislation
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
that's one of the sticking points was
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
children who are at risk of being placed
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
in a residential facility so if you look
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
at the proposal um the amendment to 169
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
c102b and uh chairman mcmah you asked
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
where did or representative long where
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
did the parties agree I think we came to
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
a point where we could agree that
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
children who are currently in a
 
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.990 align:start position:0%
children who are currently in a
residential

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
facility should be appointed Council the
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem was the rest of that paragraph
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
Was how do we
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
determine children who the division may
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
need to place and that was really the
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
more we looked at this language the more
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
complicated it became and this is the
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
kind of language we think specifically
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
that the Judiciary and
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
DCF talk us through to when the division
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
suspects they need to place a child in a
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
facility what does that look like how
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
could that look like how quickly could
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary respond to this so to
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
answer your question no they can't weigh
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
in on a yay or nay but to let the
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
parties better understand how the people
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
who will actually have to implement this
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
law daytoday how this is going to work
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
and so we think that their voices were
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
um were critical so that that in
 
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.030 align:start position:0%
um were critical so that that in
particular

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
that whole language after
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
um that starts except in the case of an
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
emergency and there was agreement on um
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
from the other side that if the
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
division I'm I'm actually looking at the
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
the language that um Karen Rosenberg
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
got is that 2B yeah oh 2B okay right
 
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.949 align:start position:0%
got is that 2B yeah oh 2B okay right
here

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.509 align:start position:0%
here
yeah

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
so everything starting with accept and
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
everything down we thought was clunky
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
and unclear and difficult to
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
administer and frankly it's our position
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
it's kasa's position we don't have the
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
resources to support this I mean that's
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
a I mean po I know this is a policy
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
organization but this language assumes
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
we have F other Foster families we've
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
got other resident other relative
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
placements and we have attorneys I mean
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
that that's remained a concern that
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
right now we do not have a system in
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
place to support this legislation we
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
wish we did we really wish we did um
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
it's our concern that if if legislation
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
is enacted without a system to support
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
that children um that this will not be
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
good for
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
kids representative thank you chairman I
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
just have one question because I want to
 
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
understand you guys and by the way thank
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
you all for being here when I think
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
about you know who's protecting the
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
children in our um communities you guys
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
are all the Heavy Hitters so thank you
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
very much for everything that you do um
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
so when I look at this and I hear you
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
that the resources and stuff I want to
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
understand more like of that groundwork
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
whenever you have a case where a kiddo
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
is you find out that there they might be
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
placed or that this is going to happen
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
what does that time period look like
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm seeing like two days and
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
stuff like I I know I have friends in
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
other areas that are foster parents and
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
it comes up very quick like within an
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
hour so what what does that timeline
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
what would language like that this do
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
with that timeline and that's I think
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the concern is we haven't
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
defined what an emergency is is an
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
emergency that the child is setting
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
fires in the foster home that the child
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
has killed the Foster family's pet I
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
mean what an emergency look like in our
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
cases is very it depends on the child
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
depends on the home and that we think
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the division does need to respond
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly and depending on where
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
the child can go it it depends the
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
challenge with looking at the children
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
at risk or children who the division is
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
contemplating it's more subtle than that
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's the family is not accepting of a of
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
the child's sexual orientation or the CH
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
the the child is allergic to the family
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
pet you know the situation where we know
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a good fit but and we know the
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
child needs to be removed but gosh we
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
don't have a place to put this child we
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't have another foster home so we
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
feel the division needs to be able to
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
have its statutory authority to be the
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
child's custodian to temporarily place a
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
child in a situation to prevent the
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
escalation and disregulation that could
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
occur that could not be harmful of the
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
child to leave that child in a situation
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is not in the child's best interest
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
and I think to add to that this was
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
really intended for children who are at
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
risk of placement in a residential
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
facility so it's not necessarily just
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
about Foster moving from one foster home
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
to another but it was being able to
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
identify those those kids at risk of
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
facility thank you so in a residential
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
like what does that I know that it's
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
each case is individual but what does
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
that typically look like as far as
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
what's your time frame from the time
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
when you find out like I'm just I just
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
want to be very um pragmatic about you
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
know it if you add resources like what
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
would this bottleneck things what in
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
your opinion would it and I wouldn't
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
mind you guys answering as well that
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
would be great but I just want to
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
understand and not complicate the
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
timeline from when this thing need to
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
happen um for the record I'm Karen
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center and I'm a
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
member of what's known as the juvenile

um and wait who would I
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
forget got it all um so six
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
organizations who all stand behind the
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that I emailed to the
 
00:15:58.199 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
amendment that I emailed to the
committee

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and in in part I want to
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
just remind you that at the last
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing the work session um
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
this members of this committee expressed
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
a desire to not do this halfway um there
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
were big concerns about children who had
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
been placed at
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
bledo a really dangerous facility and
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
those children were not represented by
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
Council and um and although you know it
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
is one thing we all agree on here is the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
importance of kasas and how valuable
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
their role is in these proceedings
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
because they form really good
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
relationships with children they have
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know they are talking to DCF they're
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
talking with um the parents um but um
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
but they're not attorneys they have
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys but they are not attorneys and
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
it can be very difficult for a volunteer
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
Casa to secure records at a at an away
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
facility to have contact with their
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
children when they're far away and
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
having a child's appointed counsel can
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
make a big difference in terms of
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
cutting through a lot of bureaucracy and
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
asserting the child's rights under the
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
law so I think that one of the things
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
that this committee directed us to do
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
was to look beyond the Court's
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
discretionary authority to appoint
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
councel and see if there was a way to
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
come together with all of our
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and decide and come up
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
with some language that would address
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
the risks and real harm that children
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
may suffer when they are
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily placed at residential
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
facilities and so that is what we
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
attempted to
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
do now I it should be noted that the
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
courts were actually invited to our we
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
met twice in person following the
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee's meeting and the courts were
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
invited to participate in both of those
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
meetings um Aon mcran did or krian did
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
participate in one meeting and was I
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
think unavailable for our second meeting
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
however she informed us really clearly
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
that the court was not able to take a
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
position or not going to take a position
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
on an amendment she provided some
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
information to us that was really
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
helpful in um you know in terms of how
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
they would respond to legislation that
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
might come out so it was helpful to have
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
her there we did not invite DF to the
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
table in part because we been informed
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
by their Council in the past that they
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
are not taking a position on whether
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
children ought to have Council appointed
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect proceedings um and
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
for reasons that you discussed it would
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
be very it might be challenging it was
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
already challenging we worked really
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
hard to try to get to yes with all of
 
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
hard to try to get to yes with all of
our

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
organizations and um that would add
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
another wrinkle however we did look at
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
DS dcyf policy um about how placement
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
decisions are made and what their
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
procedures are there are people on the
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
Jr RPG not myself but um Lisa Wolford
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
and Michelle werin who represent
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
children in these situations who drew
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
from their own experience so we did have
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
and and of course Casa also has a lot of
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with um individuals
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and children in these situations so um
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
we really don't think that the fact that
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
dcwf was not at the table is really a
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
barrier to this committee making an
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
informed decision about how to proceed
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
so um that aside um there the object
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
here was to broaden the Court's
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
discretion um which I think we did
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much pretty easily um agree on
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
language that would broaden the Court's
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
discretion to appoint
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
counsel um and I think that you know
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
when we spoke about it as um as Caroline
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
me Delaney mentioned to you we did agree
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that it was pretty easy to say if
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
kids are in residential facilities they
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
ought have Council appointed we agreed
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
in principle on the idea that when
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
children are at imminent risk not you
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
know not a you know not just a thought
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
of risk but that there was definitely a
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
real risk that they might be placed in a
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
residential um facility that they ought
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
to have Council appointed and so we did
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
our best to Define what that was and in
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
doing that um what we did was we looked
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
at dcf's current policy on when they you
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
know what the procedures are when they
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
think that it's possible that a child's
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
needs cannot be met um in a foster
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
family or kinship home or in their
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
parents home and a residential placement
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
should be considered and what DCF policy
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
says is that they should refer the child
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
for an independent assessment where
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're using is the cans so we use that
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
as a as one touch point for when uh
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
because they're they are knowing that
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be referring the child
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
for an assessment and the purpose of
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
that assessment is to make a
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
determination does the child need to be
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
placed in a residential facility and and
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
part of that decision goes to what the
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
child's you know emotional mental health
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
needs are as well as to whether you know
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
whether those needs could be met in the
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
community so we thought that was a touch
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
point that we could agree upon when DCF
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
decides that they are going to be
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
referring someone that they would notify
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
the court of that fact so then the court
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
could go and appoint
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
counsel it didn't the other thing that
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
our group felt was important was to also
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
consider when as a touch point when DCF
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
sends packets to facilities because what
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
we've learned in our experience with
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
children is that oftentimes DCF doesn't
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
follow the policy of on of not sort of
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
holding back on a referral um to a
 
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.830 align:start position:0%
holding back on a referral um to a
residential

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
placement um until they've our
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
perspective and considering when Council
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
ought to be appointed for
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
children we've considered that children
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
are also at risk not just when DCF is
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
considering doing this cans assessment
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
but also if DCF is actively referring
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
children for consideration for admission
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
to a facility so that appears in this
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and and the and what would
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
happen on in this amendment that we're
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
asking you to consider is that at that
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
point DCF would notify the court um that
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
they are pursuing possible placement
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
either through the assessment or through
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
referring children by sending their
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
individual information to facilities and
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
then it would be up to the court to
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel there's nothing in here
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
that says that the placement is held up
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
however and and we understand that it
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
could take time time while we are
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
developing attorneys to represent
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
children and training them and making
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
sure they're prepared there might be
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
delays that's but we're setting up a
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
statute that is going to be not for just
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
today not just for tomorrow but for into
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
the future for how children's rights and
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
their best interests are going to be
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
protected and it's a little bit of a
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg situation if we don't do
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
anything to guarantee a right for
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
representation for children that their
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable stage when they are at
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
the highest risk of being ripped out of
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
their schools ripped out of their
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
communities removed from their homes and
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
put in an institution if we don't get
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
that into law then we're never going to
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
develop that pool of attorneys because
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
they they won't be required right if we
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
require them then we're going to develop
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
that pool of attorneys to represent
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
children in emergency
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
situations which we did not Define
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
purposely to allow for some
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility a child can be removed a
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
child can be removed from a dangerous
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
situation and the court wouldn't get
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
notice of the child's removal even
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
removal to a facility a residential
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
facility they would after the child is
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
removed from that facility would be when
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
DCF would notify the court and then at
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
that point the court would appoint
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
counsel for the child but there was no
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
intention to leave children lingering in
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
a dangerous situation all that we
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
intended to do here was set up a
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
framework for when DCF would notify the
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
court that either the child is placed or
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
at really high risk of being placed in a
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
facility and then it would be up to the
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
court to appoint counsel for that
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
child another thing that we thought was
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
really important that's also in this
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is that with regard to those
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
discretionary appointments where a child
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
might with this expanded discretion be
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
able to ask the court to appoint counsel
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
for something other than a placement a
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
residential you know a facility
 
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
placement because that's another right
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
that would the child would have and
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
there is a foster care children's Bill
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
of Rights we felt it was really
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
important that the foster care
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights be amended to
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
reflect that additional right that a
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
child would have to simply request
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
appointment of counsel it's not again
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they would get counsel
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
but at least they would be informed as
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
they are informed about a whole lot of
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
other rights like the right to have Team
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
meetings and participate in team
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
meetings right to normaly all the things
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
that are in the Foster children's Bill
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
of Rights we felt it was really
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
important that children be notified when
 
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
they're that the the rights have been
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
expanded in some way um and that also
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a bit of a sticking
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
point um I think because of a
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that our organizations
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
had about the import of that so
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if that I mean that's a
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
long-winded response and probably didn't
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
even answer your question but I'm I'm
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
hoping it was
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
helpful was it helpful representative
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
Greg so how could that not be helpful um
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
it was I'm not even sure that my
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
question um needs to be answered at that
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
point now because I'm reading that and
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of understanding but yeah thank you
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
for that it was all helpful all the
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
information by the way I mean we sit on
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
a committee where half of us agree
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes and half of us don't so we
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
certainly understand how disagreements
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
can happen with the best of intentions
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I don't have any further
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
questions right now I'm still like
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
absorbing all
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
that if we could just take a moment to
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
respond kaso I mean again attorney
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg and I were up until the end of
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
the day on Monday we've been talking a
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
lot on this with respect to the adding
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the children's Bill of Rights that
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
was something um that that Casa had
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
agreed to but what did not make the
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
proposal and that the reason why we
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't fully get behind it was an
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
issue that we brought up at the last
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
hearing we wanted inclusion in the
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that children and their
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys cannot participate in the
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing and we had raised
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
our concerns about this at the last
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
hearing that children that that parents
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
could try to manipulate their children
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
that a child would be faced potentially
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
with being either feeling they need to
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
lie on their on the stand or forever
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
feeling guilty that it was their fault
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
that the division got involved with
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
their family and children do feel guilty
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
about that that if I hadn't spoken up
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe you know that DCF wouldn't be
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
involved with my family and so it's
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
kasa's position that the parents that
 
00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
the children should not be involved in
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
that initial Hearing in terms of
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
contesting whether or not they are an
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected child under the law
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
and one other point that I believe that
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
there may be a misconception that every
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
other party in these cases has an
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
attorney and that's that's not entirely
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
accurate it is only with respect to
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
right to counsel it is only a parent who
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
is the petitioned parent has a right an
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
Indigent to be appointed an attorney so
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
in the case of a father who has never
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
been involved in the child's life or
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
minimally involved in the child's life
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
and is not not the petition parent
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
meaning he is not the parent who is
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for the abuse neglect he is
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
does not get appointed an attorney if he
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
is not a household member and I
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully think that's something the
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
committee should look at in terms of
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
every parent having an attorney in these
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
cases we also have women who are victims
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence who if they are not
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
the party responsible and the and they
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
are not a household member father has
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
been removed she in some cases is not
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
appointed an attorney even if we have
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
filed Casa a motion saying listen it's
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
in the child's best interest if Mom can
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
come to the hearing and talk about how
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
the kids are doing and she's told the
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
court I'm too afraid of my abuser and
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to open my mouth so we
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
think everybody in a it would be great
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
if everybody had representation and
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
everybody's rights are being protected
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
we just think there's a whole lot here
 
00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
we just think there's a whole lot here
um

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
and that a good first step would be to
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
allow those kids both in residential
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
both who are um where the case really
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
warrants it to have judges have the
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
ability to point law lawyers now for
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
those kids and then we are ready willing
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
and able to continue to have late night
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
conversations and to keep going back and
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
forth and hopefully find something that
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
will um that will work best for New
 
00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
will um that will work best for New
Hampshire's

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
children repres resentative
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman so I mean I'm
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the opinion and I'm not in the trenes
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
as you all are uh but I'm of the opinion
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the judicatory hearing is one of
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
the best um you know has the potential
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
of driving this child to where their
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
future's going to be uh at that decision
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
um so I I wonder why you sense that an
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
attorney should not be represented a
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
child I'm not talking about a parents
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just in regard to to the child and
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about the child being
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
there I'm talking about the attorney
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
representing the child at these
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
harmful in many Cas in some cases it
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
might not be it raises If the child is
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
represented at the adjudicatory hearing
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
we do think and this happens where
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
parents attorneys try to subpoena
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
children to testify and that where
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
parents will say my child is lying my
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
child is
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
exaggerating about the the abuse and
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's the worst cases it's the sexual
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
abuse cases it's the worst physical
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
abuse cases if we do have a concern that
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
even if the attorney is there that um
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
that children that parents will try well
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
that you can protect the child in the
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing because the
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
attorney will be able to jump up and
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
object I mean right now there isn't
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
there isn't a proposal to keep children
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
from coming to that hearing and I will
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
also say that RSA one uh 169 c18 the
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing statute only
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
addresses petitioners typically the
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
state and petition the parents so there
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
isn't anything currently in the
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
adjudication statute that all that even
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
suggests including Casa I mean the
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
guardian ad lium also in in that statute
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
is not included as a party that presents
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
evidence or cross-examines Witnesses so
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
that statute needs to get changed as
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
well if there's any suggestion that CH
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
children attorneys are going to take an
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
active part at the adjudicatory hearing
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
so if one of the parties is looking to
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
subpoena the child does that happen even
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
if though there's an attorney not there
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
I would think yes it CIF files a motion
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
to quash we we file and and we're we
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
we're successful saying it is not
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the child to be uh
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
subpoena to testify at the adjudicatory
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
hearing uh there is um there's New
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case in Ray G
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
that talks about the policy reasons
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
behind why we keep kids from um hearing
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
I mean even though that they're the
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
victims to needing to be a part
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
of litigating
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
this I'd like to interject um first of
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
all I think that um when you look at the
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing one of the things
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
that is an issue is family
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity that is a very important right
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
and one that the child has a real
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
interest in and a lot of children are
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
not going to want to have anything to do
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
with these adjudicatory hearings but if
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
they happen to be appointed councel and
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
they want their councel to weigh in on
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
that you know basically dissolution of
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
their family potentially um that seems
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
very appropriate and that if you
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
appointed Council it would be a
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
violation of the tri it would be it
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
would make it impossible for Council to
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
actually do their jobs if they were
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited or presented with barriers
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that other Council don't have in
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
hearings secondly that the case that um
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
was raised enry GG 166 New Hampshire 193
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
basically in that Supreme Court case a
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
father did try to subpena his child um
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
and the and the Supreme Court and and
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the and the trial court said no you
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
can't you're not going to be a to Su
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
subpoena the child we're not going to
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
have the kid here there was a video
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and that's good enough the
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ended up taking that case
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
and basically said it was appropriate
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
for the court not to require that child
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
to testify that the that 169c is about
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
in in large part determinations about
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of the child
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
and then the court went on to talk about
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
factors that the court that courts ought
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
to consider in determining whether
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
children ought to be brought in to
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and that would include things
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
like um factors would include the
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
specific potential harm to the child if
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
they were required to testify whether or
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
not there are alternatives to the um to
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
inquir testimony that would meaningfully
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
that would provide the information that
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
the other party is trying to elicit and
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
nowhere does this decision say that
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
children should not participate in any
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
portion of the decision courts have
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
discretion and it's it's in the court
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
protocols they have discretion to
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
determine whether a child ought to be
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
able to participate in any one of these
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings including the adjudicatory
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding there are federal funds that
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
are available not a lot so don't start
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
spending them too quickly but if we
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to um take advantage of them for
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
E funds um which are federal funds are
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
available to defay the cost of
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
representation and what all the policy
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
and rules say um about the
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of 4 funds and using them
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
for this purpose is that those funds are
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
available at all stages of the
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding it does not ex say that you
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
know if the children cannot participate
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
or have attorneys to participate in
 
00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:40.310 align:start position:0%
or have attorneys to participate in
these

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
hearings so it would really of of the 38
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
or so states that have um fully
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
established rights to counsel for
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
children none of them say that the child
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
cannot have counsel at a judicatory
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
hearings so you know if we we were to
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy like that New Hampshire
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be an outlier um like I said I
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't know that this would come up very
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
often but to hamstring an attorney
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
prevent an attorney from doing you know
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
what they would be required to do under
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
rules of professional conduct when they
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
have a client the child I think would
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
really be a disservice to everyone okay
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
follow I if I may uh in your experiences
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
have you seen where uh judge uh Woulda a
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
child and have the child speak or is
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
none I only um thus far I've had one
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
case it was a physical assault case
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
where a mom allegedly broke her
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
teenager's jaw and the mom wanted like a
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
criminal case to was alleging uh
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
self-defense and it was before the
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
statute was changed we were successful
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
in keeping the child from being required
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
to testify at the family court proceding
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
proing at that time there was um we had
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
denovo appeals to the superior court and
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
the superior court judge allowed um
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
denied I had filed a motion in lemon
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
that uh to prevent the child from being
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
required to testify and in that case and
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
personally I think it's because Superior
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
Court judges weren't accustomed to
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
seeing uh a lot of family cases and also
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
see more criminal cases um but that we
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
we have had one case where that was
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
required the child so I'm I'm I'm
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
looking to get a clear indication as to
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
why it's
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
problematic uh with an attorney in the
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing uh one of them was
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to subing the child I
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
mean if the child if for the for the
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
attorney to be there I mean for example
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
Casas do not participate guard and
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
private Guardian Adlabs do not
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
participate in the adjudicatory hearing
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
they are not referenced as participants
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
in the adjudicator hearing statute are
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
they they they of course they are
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
present they're present at the
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing and they're present
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
to certainly hear all that information
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
and we are not saying that children's
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys if they've been appointed an
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
attorney should not be present but
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
should not um participate in the
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing okay and and uh if
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
I may ask M Rosenberg a question
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh having having having the attorney
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
present in my opinion would give the
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
attorney the you know the upper hand to
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
know what's going on so that he could
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
immediately represent the child knowing
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
what the discussion was all
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
about where where what's what's
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
important to you where the attorney has
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
to be part of the
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh what if the evidence does not
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
indicate that there actually was abuse
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
or neglect that it's not pro that really
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
poverty and the child wasn't connected
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
the family wasn't really connected with
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
the kind of resources that were
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
necessary so that the child could have
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
adequate nutrition or what if it was
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
some you know something else is going on
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney's participation could be
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
critical in deter in the Court's
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
ultimate determination about whether
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
this should be the complaint should be
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
petition should be founded or whether
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
there ought to be other services looked
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
at or put into place rather than a
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
founded petition which could you know
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
these decisions have a effect okay so I
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
think you know it off the fly it's hard
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
I me I think some of my colleagues might
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with some other
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
examples of where having an attorney
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
would be really could be important to
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
children like I say I don't think it
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
will come up very often but to basically
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
prohibit this upfront instead of relying
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the law that currently exists that
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
gives courts discretion about whether
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
children participate in any of these
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings or whether their Council
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
participate um um we don't need to touch
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
that with this amendment okay so so the
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
intent of what I'm hearing is there's
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
another statute that would have to be
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
change because the intent is with the
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
petitioner uh with the two parties uh
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
which of course the children are brought
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
up uh so that's where I'm trying to
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
define the importance of the attorney
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
being there I I lean towards yes um it's
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
important if if this attorney is going
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
to represent that child um going for
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
forward that in every aspect they should
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
be there uh I'm I'm in the middle of
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
just being there uh allowing allowing an
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
appointment of an attorney to uh be
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
present uh you know at minimum yeah I if
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
if I could respond to two things um I
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
think the cases that we see and as you
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
know we see hundreds of these cases and
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
we're involved in hundreds of these
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
cases it's very infrequent that the what
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
when a child is removed or when a
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
petition is filed that it is for things
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
like neglect night um not being fed well
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
or poverty dcyf H investigates
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
investigates and investigates and
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
reports are made and reports were made
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
if if anything we see the reverse of
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
that we see petitions being filed that
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
should have been filed much sooner and
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's very rare that it is just that a
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
family is in need of services because
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
there are other referral opportunities
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of work being done and
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide in the whole prevention Arena
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the kids never even show up in court
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
and the families get what they need in
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
advance because it is a horrible
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
experience for everyone
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
involved one of the things that could
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
potentially happen and I'm not an
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
attorney so these kind speak to this
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
better um but I think if if the attorney
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
at the judicatory hearing is
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
representing what their client wants
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
their expressed issues and if that
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
12-year-old little girl who's been
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
sexually abused repeatedly by mom's
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
boyfriend's stepdad says I want to go
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
home I really want to go home it's up to
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
her attorney then if they're at that
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing to say my my client
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
wants to be returned home it's clearly
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
not in her best interest to be returned
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
home cuz Mom can't keep her safe or for
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reasons but he needs to argue
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
that point to the court if he is truly
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
advocating for what his client wishes
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one of the
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
complicating figures things that could
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
get factored into the adjudicatory
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
hearing I mean we have had so many cases
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
where kids do want to be returned but it
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
isn't safe and if that attorney is
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
representing what their client wishes
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is what their role is that that
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
gets it's messy and it gets it puts kids
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
at risk of being returned to unsafe
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
homes so I okay okay that if so no so so
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
would would you be okay with an
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
appointment of an attorney prior to the
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory however they could they
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't participate but they would be
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
present I that's that's not an issue I
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
don't think so I don't think so no she
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
she no we don't think so hang on Karen
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
geez okay okay thanks
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
thanks I know I'm a lot um I I mean I
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a big difference in being
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
at a hearing and having your hands tied
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
and not being able to represent your
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
clients interests and just because a
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
child has an attorney appointed who
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
represents their CH their clients
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
expressed interest doesn't mean that the
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
attorney's going to win right we know
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
that there's basically it's just going
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
to raise the level of the discussion and
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
what's what the court considers so the
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
court will hear from the casa who will
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
present all the facts I'm sorry they
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
hear from D they'll hear from DCF excuse
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
me I stand corrected thank you um who
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
will hear the petition and all the facts
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
that they're relying on they'll hear
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
from the parent and they'll hear from
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
the child's attorney and the court will
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
make a decision having heard all of the
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
arguments and it as Marty discussed
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
where there are you know very detailed
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
investigations where decisions maybe
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
should have been made long time ago and
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's multiple incidents the courts
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
will hear that and when the attorney if
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
the attorney happens to be appointed
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
because the child was placed
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
residentially and the child says I
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
really want to go home the attorney will
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
engage in a discussion with their client
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney will say here's what the if
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
if they're doing their job they'll say
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
here's what the evidence shows I'm
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
really sorry but the evidence shows that
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
you've been victimized 20 times over the
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
last year and you sexually assaulted and
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
all these terrible things and that all
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
of the interventions that were done on a
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis didn't work and so the
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
court probably isn't going to say you
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
can go home but let's talk about what
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
you're you know what's what what else is
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
going on here may maybe there's some
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
other Solutions and so maybe what the
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
attorney would do is look at did DCF due
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
due diligence in looking for kinship
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
placements as an alternative to a
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
facility because we're only talking
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
about children now who are in facilities
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
did they did DCF um really exhaust
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
Foster families as an as a potential
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
Source did you know did is the facility
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
that you're placed at even appropriate
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
is there another facility that's closer
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
are these things that you might consider
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
and and they might be able to actually
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
talk to their client and get Authority
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
from their client to express the
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
client's desire to return home but maybe
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
with some interim steps so it's it's not
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
black and white but what this does is it
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
prevent it presents an opportunity for
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
the child to feel respected that their
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
opinion is respected that they are that
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
what they say matters and what they care
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
about matters to have it fully
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
considered by the court because if their
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
attorney is there you know even if the
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
attorney tries to get the you know talks
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
to their client about what they think
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know might be reasonable or that the
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
court might order in Le of you know
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
instead of bringing them home and and
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
they make the argument and the court
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that the child is heard the
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
child is empowered in this situation
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
where they've been completely out of
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
control where their world is upside down
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
where really even though they're their
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
abusers their parents are the only
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
parents that have been their parents at
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
least they've been heard and can be
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
empowered by this but if their attorney
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
has to just sit still idly it's okay I'm
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
glad I'm not the only one we're both
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
grabby people I'm I'm worse than she is
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
all right I admit I'm worse than you
 
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.589 align:start position:0%
all right I admit I'm worse than you
Marty

00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
Marty
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
um if if you know that that at least the
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
child would be heard and the judge will
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
make a decision about what needs to
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
happen BEC and and like I said attorneys
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't always win see but I'm thinking of
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
the potential of conflict with the child
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
and their new attorney also if if I I
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
mean I don't believe again I'm not your
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
the experts as you
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
are but I know there have there have
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
been abused and neglected children that
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
want to be with
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
their parent it's their parent they know
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know yeah so so I I get that right
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and for an attorney who's who's the
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
child's being told that they're going to
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
represent your expressed uh wants what
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
what is it that you want and I say I
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to go with my mother uh and he
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
explains to me well you know your mother
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't done a good job so far uh you
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
know in a nice manner um you know that
 
00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:54.030 align:start position:0%
know in a nice manner um you know that
may

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
diffuse the child feeling that this
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
person is representing me and we want
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we want the child to feel like
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
they're empowered okay I have somebody
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
who has my best interest you know so I
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know right from the get-go
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
if I tell I want to be my mother and
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
they explained to me that it's not a
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
good idea that I would be like wait a
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
minute I you know yeah I yeah if I if we
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
could just back up again we were in
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
complete agreement ment about a
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
a children who are placed in residential
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
facilities should have counsel period
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
the end we're in we're in agreement with
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
that where where we got stuck was that
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
that appointment happened at
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
adjudication so if I mean there's a lot
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
of consensus but that was one of the
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
points because P to representative long
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
because that could potentially
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
complicate things for the child but that
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
attorney representation if their in
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
placement is abs absolutely we support
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
that we think it's important and so that
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
those and primarily it's youth that are
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
placed in residential facilities that
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
they have that they have a voice in that
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
proceeding that they have an attorney
 
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
standing by their side they also will
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
have a casa standing by their side or
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
another G so um but I think that was
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
that was one of the sticking points was
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
that when the appointment of that
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
Council occur of council occurred right
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
so so in my mind I'm thinking not
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily when uh but participant or
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
present I mean as far as the
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory present is okay your issue
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
was uh um
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
participating and we actually have
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
language that we could forward that was
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
an amendment to 169 c18 that
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
specifically stated that the if if an
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
attorney is appointed pursuant to uh C10
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that they would not participate at the
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing that was language
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
we asked to be um included just for for
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
this issue and we understand reasonable
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
Minds disagree all the time uh but this
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
language did not make it into a a final
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
consensus draft but if that is important
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
to to the representative we could
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay anything
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
further from the individual to your
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
right Madam s thank thank you so much uh
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
Lisa Wolford for the children's Law
 
00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
Center of New Hampshire I I um they've
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
covered a lot and so I I don't want to
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
retread old ground but but I will say
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
because the statute now the child
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
protection act does not um does not
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
weigh in on when
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
Council on whether Council or the child
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
should be present at the adjudicatory
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
hearing I I I don't think that's
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
something um that you should be
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about I I think it is best to
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
leave theate statute as is and and as is
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
is that the statute does not address uh
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
who should be at the adjudicatory
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and who should not it is it is
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
accurate that 169c
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
183 talks about uh the matter being
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicated so whether the parent is
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
neglectful or abusive and refers to the
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
state and the parents uh and the parents
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
um so if a child's lawyer came to an
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing because their child
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be their client wanted
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
them to be there and their client wanted
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
them to participate in the hearing the
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney presumably would let the
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
judge know that that was their intention
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
they they they can't just uh barge over
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
to the witness um uh you know they they
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
can't just start calling Witnesses right
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
so I I think that this is a ter a
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
determination that our judges are
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
equipped to make uh and I think in the
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
first instance we should leave it to
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
judges to make those determinations
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
I mean we we we I I don't recall the
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
um yesterday so yesterday apparently we
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
talked about it yesterday but that flew
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
over my head that that is something that
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
that I I don't think makes sense and and
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
um and would not a agree to to to if I
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly and it's not
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
before you it has not been uh proposed
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
to you but as I understand it correctly
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
what attorney delini was saying is that
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
the The Proposal was an amendment to uh
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
c183 that would exclude um the child and
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
their councel from the adjudicatory
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
proceedings which we think for the
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
reasons that you you've you've discussed
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative long um and attorney
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg have address are not
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate because we do think children
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
when they decide that they want to be
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
there which is not going to be every
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
case and so we're talking about a
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
limited number of cases right and
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
limited number of kids who want to
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
participate but when they decide they
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to be there
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
um they should be empowered uh with that
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
presence a a at the time when uh a
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental decision which will
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
profoundly alter their lives is going to
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
be made right and if I could just uh
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
give one more followup question on that
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh do you suspect that there will be
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
more children knowing that they have an
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
attorney that would want to go to the
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
judicatory hearing and that would be a
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
concern of mine I I'm thinking I'm 12
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
years old I got an attorney I'm
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
stretching my sister Benders and uh yes
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
I want you there and uh by the way I'd
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
like to be there myself um so I I so but
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
that won't necessarily be the case
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no guarantee I I
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
think that's right there there isn't I
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
mean I have clients who don't want to
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
come to court and and their causas and
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
um their caas beg them to come to court
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
DCF wants them to come to court the
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
judge wants them to come to court they
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to court okay um I I
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
have clients who do want to come to
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
court and I I file motions to ensure
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
that they're transported um so but I
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
think the difference at the adjudication
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
is that's where their parent I mean it's
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
like a trial right that's where their
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
parents and and for them to potentially
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
witness that yeah I I don't I think that
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
can add just another trauma to the
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
traumas that they've already experienced
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I I guess
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we struggle with this
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
appointment at adjudication because if
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
if the attorney if the if the child who
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
is like a client of the attorney wants
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
to attend the client really has
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
has to do what their client is directing
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
them to do so but the judge doesn't
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
right and so so
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
inry happy to give you my one copy which
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
is in my binder but in regg makes very
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
clear it is up to the judge whether the
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
child testifies and and presumably the
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
judge could also decide and maybe
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
there's a legal argument about the
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
child's rights whether the child has do
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
process rights to attend versus the
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
judge's determination of their best
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
interest but in Reg
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
in that case that child dcyf represented
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the to the uh Family Division or the
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
tri might have been a superior court
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
case but represented to the trial judge
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the the child's therapist would
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
provide testimony that the child should
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
not be present in court and should not
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
testify um and the Supreme Court said
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
that is great judges should make those
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
determinations and take all of that
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
information into
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
consideration agreed if given the
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity right well the judge will
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
always have the opportunity I I yeah I
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
understand that I think if a child
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't NE a child could be present but
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be required to testify
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
and just being present in the courtroom
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
could be traumatic for the child but the
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
judge could make a determination about
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
presence understand so am I witnessing
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
how your conversations with these last
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
couple couple of weeks it's complicated
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated and you wanted
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
something simple I believe
 
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
something simple I believe
representative

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
long but but I'm I'm still not sure why
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
I well I I get that I guess that that's
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
what Kasa wants I mean I think the the
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
agreement is that CH more children
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
should have lawyers um children who are
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
in placement should have lawyers and
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
then children we believe who are at risk
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
of placement risk being defined the way
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
we've proposed um which we think is
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
clear which relies on the language of
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
dcyf policy
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
1615 um those kids should have counsel
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
the the issue about the adjudicatory
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
hearing is one that every judge in every
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
case can
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
decide and at risk of placement means
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
residential placement just so we're
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
residential placement just so we're
clear

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
Members thank you Mr
 
00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
Members thank you Mr
chairman

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
clarify I got a little more uh
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
clarification on on the RIS of placement
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
of of um residential
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
placement uh so that that's clear there
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
so it's residential placement uh with
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
respect to cans what what you know when
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
when we when when a child um an
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
emergency is placed in a residential
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
placement and they are going to do the
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
cans uh assessment um what what is that
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
time frame because is that sort of a
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
child in limbo or or what is what is the
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
time frame of this assessment when when
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
would the when would the courts get a um
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
assessment you may approach the bench
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
Miss mford yes yeah just get comfortable
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh and and in anybody's
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
experience has that been problematic uh
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it has been a few times
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
but percentage wise is there is there a
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
um uh there was a lot of added trauma to
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
children when they're waiting for 30
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
days in a placement and then maybe some
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the assessments say you know what I
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
think we have a
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
foster uh family that would be able to
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
take this child because my understanding
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
is those can assessments that they do
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
levels okay and my understanding is uh
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
some of these placements when you give a
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
level um it's a turnoff yeah no we're
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
all set we we we're not interested
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
um so so I'm wondering if uh um I'm I'm
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh after an
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
assessment has there been
 
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.549 align:start position:0%
assessment has there been
reconsideration

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
for whether a foster home or
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
um you know a family member
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
know

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the cat it's the cat assessment the
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
Maximus cat um not the cans which is a
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
different assessment uh but where the
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
where the cans concludes that the child
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
does not need to be removed in in uh and
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
put in placement in my experience um the
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
kid was not removed so they the DCF was
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
waiting for the for the cat assessment
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
result before moving the kid I I mean DF
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
should would be referring kids for cat
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
assessments if they believe that the the
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
child's needs indicate residential
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
placement and that should be done prior
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
to a child moving um I think probably
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
and and maybe maybe others will have
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
other information but the times during
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
which the cat is done after placement
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
are those emergency placements okay yeah
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just trying to get my arms
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
around the emergency placements that's
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
seems a little problematic so so I I
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
agree with with attorney Rosenberg that
 
01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:32.349 align:start position:0%
agree with with attorney Rosenberg that
that

01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
emergency means what its common
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
dictionary definition is and and that
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
DCF should know what that means the
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
party should know and a judge should
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
know there's nothing in the language
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we've proposed that would inhibit
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
DCF from placing a child um based on
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
their perception of what an emergency is
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
I mean once Council for a child is
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
appointed um the attorney might take
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
issue with the the uh emergency
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
assessment and I I suppose that could be
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
litigated but but dcyf could move the
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
child um and they do move children based
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
on a conclusion about emergency
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
emergency in my experience means the kid
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
has to move right period all right very
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.789 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
would anyone have any further
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
here oh you can get get up right right
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
heard good afternoon for the record
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
Cassandra Sanchez child advocate for the
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
State of New
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and as others um May had
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned prior um my office had been
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
involved in meetings discussing the
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments that are before you today um
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have been in agreement with the
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
assessment that was put forth by the
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
jrpg um in which um this is the one with
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
the more extensive language um in which
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
children in residential placement or at
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
risk of placement um are able to be
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
assigned councel at the discretion of
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
the Court um and to just refer back to
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
some of the other questions that were
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
asked earlier comments that were made
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
earlier um I do think it's important to
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that the resarch research does
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
not tell us that children being present
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
at a a judicatory hearing is going to be
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
traumatizing there are many instances
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
for some children where it'll actually
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
be a healing process for them especially
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
if they are able to see their
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
perpetrator held accountable for what
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
they have done to them um so we don't
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
have an outstanding amount of research
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
that says that that is negative and
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
impactful um process for them to
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
participate in um and I do feel strongly
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
that their attorney should be a part of
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
that um and have an opportunity to voice
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
what the child wants um like others said
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
before me I do believe that the judges
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
have the ability to differentiate the
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
fact that many children do want to go
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
home and love their parents because that
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
is all they know but understand the
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
facts of abuse and neglect and when it
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
is safe and appropriate to remove them
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
from that setting
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
I did also want to speak on the question
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
about the cat assessments from
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative long it is my
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that the now that the
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
program has been in full swing for quite
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
some time now there have not been many
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
delays in getting those assigned um they
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
are sent out timely Maximus has the
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing currently to be able to keep up
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
and and do those assessments so I I do
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
believe that time of referral for the
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
cat assess assment is critical for the
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
notification to the court for an
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
attorney to be assigned um there are
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many times still that my
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
offices is receiving complaints from the
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
community in regards to placement of
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
children High numbers of children going
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
to Residential Care where there is
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
adequate family available that has not
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
been explored and I think that is the
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
critical piece of having the attorney
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
involved from the very beginning of of
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
that process so they can Advocate and uh
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
you know there are times that a a child
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
may get so the the cat scores is five is
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
the highest and n one is the lowest and
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
there are times that a child could have
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
a three or four cat assessment but
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
residential placement may still not be
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate placement for them
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
I have met with many children who do
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
better in smaller settings family like
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
settings as opposed to Residential
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
Treatment settings and so although the
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
cat may be saying they have difficulties
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
that need to be met at that higher level
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
with a small smaller environment and the
 
01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate Community Based supports
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
they can be more successful than being
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
placed in a residential facility and I
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
do believe there are times where an
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
attorney can adequately voice that to
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
the court and ensure that that placement
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
is truly being reviewed before a child
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
is sent there I also did want to share
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
some of my personal experience um before
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire I worked in
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and in the state of
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts every child is assigned an
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney at the beginning of the process
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
and throughout to to the end and this
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
was not just children residential care
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
but it was all children and I felt even
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
being on the other side at the time I
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
was working for DCF and I felt that they
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
were able to advocate for the children
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately they were able to have
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
some of those conversations some of
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
those difficult conversations that came
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
up earlier around um child's expressed
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
interest but what's in their best
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
interest and from my experience the
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys did a very good job of
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they voiced the child's
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in court but then
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
also discussed a backup plan so with the
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
child if yes you want to go with Mom and
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
Dad if that cannot happen then what and
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
then the child may say oh so and so
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
relative so then in court they are
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
saying first and foremost this child
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
wants to remain with family but if
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's not possible and the division is
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
going to be winning their case here the
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
child would like to ensure that this
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
particular family member is adequately
 
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
explored and and so they are able to to
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
somewhat represent both and I do think
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
that um skilled attorneys as long as
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
they have the the appropriate training
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
to do that um Can ensure that they
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
maintain that trusting relationship with
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
the child and truly clarify and and
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
Advocate and voice for what they want in
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
court while ensuring that there is also
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
an appropriate backup plan knowing that
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
much of the time going back home may not
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
option representative long thank you Mr
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um so a couple things uh so we
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about uh residential
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
placement yes with respect to the
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
attorney okay so not not all um now did
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
did you say the data doesn't show uh
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
added trauma to the kids or there's no
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
data it does not it there is the
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
research right now does not
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
outstandingly say that it is additional
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
trauma to the child by being present at
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
a adjudicatory hearing um there is some
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
research and support of children
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
attending these types of hearings okay
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
uh and also what uh piqu my attention uh
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
that an
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
attorney uh may drive towards family
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
placement it seems that seems very
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me that that could happen
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's what your you've
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
experienced in mass is that um instead
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
of residential placement they went
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
either with a family member or somebody
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
else yes yes I have had the experience
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
where attorneys have been able to get
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
children placed in homes and it it does
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
work a bit different there where um the
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
department in Massachusetts could not
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
approve them as a foster home because of
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
certain barriers um and it could be
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
something as simple as the space they
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
have in their home and to be a foster
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
home it requires certain space and so at
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
that point the attorney would advocate
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
for the child to still go to that
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
placement knowing that they could
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide the adequate care and maybe
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
would have to uniquely change around
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
their configurations of their house to
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
be able to fit the child in there and so
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
those are some of the situations that I
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
saw where attorneys were very successful
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
and keeping the child in a least
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting with family that the
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here today
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
I was hoping you would come what is the
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
definition of at risk like is there an
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
atrisk defined here that we would be we
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
did not come up with a definition of at
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
risk rather we pointed in in this
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
amendment here um to when we understand
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
that the the dcyf would be moving
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
towards seeking out these types of
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
placements and as um Lisa Wolford
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I was president up here
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
it is in their policy um that they're
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
there comes a time where they are
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
sending a a a cat referral out as well
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
as the child's um case packet they may
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
call it where it has all information
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
about the child to seek out placement
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so that is what we were leaning into
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
as at risk because that is the
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that that is our
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way in which the
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
division already operates when they are
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
looking for place placement Beyond
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
it m m Sanchez I'm I'm Sorry Miss
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
Sanchez let make sure I address you
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
correctly no no problem uh the the issue
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
as specific to HB 535 as
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
introduced what does that not do that
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of the Amendments that we have
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
before us will allow that flexibility to
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
do in meeting the child's needs for
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
representation the importance of that is
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
ensuring that children who are in
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
placement would have access to an
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
attorney because we do understand these
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
are our most vulnerable children that
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
are in that level of care and if we are
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
not specifying that um specifically
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
those either in residential placement or
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
at risk of residential placement would
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
have an attorney then we are missing our
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable youth having the
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate representation to ensure
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
their needs are being met appropriately
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
of course we do have Casa in place who
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
can advocate for their best interest but
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
um it is really important the a a point
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
that was made before me it is really
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
important to ensure that our children
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
feel they have a voice and that they are
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
heard this is a process where their
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
entire life is being controlled by
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
adults that they don't know um it's hard
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
enough for children to adjust in a world
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
and grow up where their life is
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
controlled by their parents whom they
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
know well and they have an understanding
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
of what the expectations are in that
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
home but to have strangers who they are
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with is very unsettling and
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
um what we see for a lot of children is
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
when there's that unknown and someone
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
else has control over their life they
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
seek out other areas of their life where
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
they can take control and often that
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
Behavior so so that with that statement
 
01:11:53.199 --> 01:11:55.189 align:start position:0%
Behavior so so that with that statement
being

01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
heard the bill as written does not
 
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.229 align:start position:0%
heard the bill as written does not
provide

01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
that access to
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
representation as it states in here
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
where it says it shall be entitled to
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
representation of
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
council it does not um because it does
 
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.310 align:start position:0%
council it does not um because it does
not

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
specify when they shall be and um and
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
especially that that piece of those at
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
risk is not those in placement and those
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
at risk of placement is not clarified
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
there and so it leaves a lot of
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
discretion to the court without
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
Youth and and then one followup with you
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
is the amendment I mean we have two
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
us the narrative that you refer to that
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
would give give this strength to the
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
application of Law and spec of law
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
representation which lines do that in
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
the amend in and the the amendment from
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh the the jrpg draft yes it would be in
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
there um and we have in um
 
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:09.330 align:start position:0%
2B and it is
 
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:10.830 align:start position:0%
2B and it is
[Music]

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
the um so down a little lower where it
 
01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
says such notification so about Midway
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
um such notification shall occur prior
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
to referral for an independent
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
assessment or sub submission of child
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
specific information
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
to such
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
placement is where it speaks about that
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
that time frame to notify the court to
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
request an attorney um as well as that
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
that additional place down there um
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
where it says the line following in case
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
of an emergency NES necessitating
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
immediate placement of a child um that
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
they shall notify the court within two
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
business days and so that is um ensuring
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
that the court is notified as closely as
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
possible and within a reasonable time
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
frame for the division to meet them that
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
um to be able to assign attorney but it
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
also leaves space for the division to
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
act in an emergency and place a child if
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
the only option is residential at that
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
time they have the ability to do that
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
while the attorney is getting
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
assigned okay and the reason I was
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
bringing this up since we um I'm
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
grateful that we received this when we
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
did but uh the butt is is dealing with
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
RS say one 1 70 and not 169 and as a
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
result this see that the difference
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
between the two I just have 169 in front
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
of us and not 170 to see what where
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
we're coming uh deficient so that so
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
that what's recommended will have the
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh result that is being
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
advocated here and that's to look after
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
our our the CH our children the the
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
minors and I just want to clarify from a
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
minor standpoint it's there's 18 is
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
majority age at the moment what's the
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
other side of that is it and from age
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
one on it it would be birth but our
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
residential if we're talking about
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
specifically those in placement children
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
in placement typically range from 5 to
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
six years up um ideally it should be 12
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
up but um we have seen children as young
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
as five or six placed in residential
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
facilities um I would like to clarify as
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
well um the important insertion in 170g
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
is to inform the children of their right
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
um which I believe is is very critical
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
to include here um because and again
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's not saying that it guarantees them
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
a right to an attorney but it is just to
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
inform the child and and add this to the
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights because if
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is a right that children have they
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
should be aware of that they should be
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
informed and have the ability to know
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
when to ask for an attorney and when I
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
was just shown by my colleagues here was
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the uh age of majority is to 21 not
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
18 and that's dealing with the mental
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
health challenges so I wanted to make
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that that is then concurrent
 
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
with what your expertise is yes there is
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
an extension to 21 for for those um
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
develop disabilities as well as those
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
that um choose to sign on into um after
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
care but they they then have some
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
decision-making power with that um but
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
there is also a a differentiator for
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
those that have disability and are
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
placed by schools that would actually go
 
01:16:29.239 --> 01:16:30.510 align:start position:0%
placed by schools that would actually go
to

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
22 okay and uh one one additional
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
question ask again we want an open
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
concept here for guidance from our
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
professionals we have the another draft
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that was in effect taken out a
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
sentence uh did you you did you get a
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
copy of that or do you have a copy of of
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
that one is this are you referring to a
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
prior amendment that was was worked on
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
between the groups or are you referring
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
to the the casa amendment that was no we
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
just referred one today from froma um so
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so yes the casa Amendment um does not
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
speak in depth to um those children that
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
are in need of placement or at risk of
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
placement and my understanding is as
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
they share today um there's some
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
reservation around some of that um
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
defining of that and when it's
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate for those attorneys to
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
hearings okay and just a clarification
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
from from for me is when it states to
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
represent the and the Word was moved
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
from one part of the existing law to
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
here the expressed interest of the child
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's the definition of
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
expressed so the expressed interest
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be the interest in which the child
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
is stating themselves rather than what
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
which what Casa represents is the best
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
interest of child which is taking taking
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
into account what is appropriate for
 
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.229 align:start position:0%
into account what is appropriate for
them

01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
developmentally um and safety wise which
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
is also um the office of the child
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
advocate also operates to ensure the
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
best interest of children is protected
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
so those two can differentiate that's
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about those
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
situations where a child may want to go
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
home to their parent that is their
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
expressed interest but it is not in
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
their best interest for safety purposes
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
to go to that
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
setting and that would be also at an
 
01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
setting and that would be also at an
adjudicatory

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
hearing as it stands in their Amendment
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that is not to
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
be at the adjudicatory hearing okay and
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
just so I'm clear myself because it's
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
always a moving Target here what's the
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
definition of a judicatory hearing I am
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
the one of the only non-attorneys in the
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
room so I am going to pass it off to
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
someone else finally I got a question
 
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
someone else finally I got a question
you

01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't but yeah no just hold right
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
there but yeah like
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
toire Legal Assistant so um the
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
definition of an adjudicatory hearing is
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
the trial so it's the trial to determine
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not the child was abused or
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
neglected um the the amendment would
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
allow representation at any stage of the
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding If the child is at risk of uh
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to residential placement so that
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
could potentially be either at or prior
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
to the adjudicatory hearing if the court
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
has removed the child from the home and
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
placed them in residential or there has
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
been a request to do that prior to the
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing and so there are
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
two touch points the preliminary hearing
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
right the adjudicatory hearing and then
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's the dispositional hearing which
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
is like the sentencing like what's going
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
to happen going forward okay wanted to
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
make sure the definition hadn't changed
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
here but thank you very much for that
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
and um Miss Sanchez we we have
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Greg has a question for
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
you so in your experience before you
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
worked in Massachusetts where you had a
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
lot the attorneys for children um was
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
there also an organization like was Casa
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
there as well yes they they were not as
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
widespread as Casa is here in New
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but yes they they do exist
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
they have Massachusetts chapter as well
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
so what does that cooperation look like
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
as far as if a are they still involved
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
like if a child has an attorney then
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
Casa is still involved I'm just looking
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
at what this looks like if we have
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
attorneys for these kiddos and what does
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
that what does that cooperation look
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
like absolutely that is actually a great
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
question um they do they would have both
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
um but again in Massachusetts they were
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
not always given a casa it would be
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
appointed by a judge I can share
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
especially in the work that my office
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
has done closely with the office of the
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
child advocate in Massachusetts that one
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations that came out
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
from their Harmony Montgomery report was
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
for there to be Casas and attorneys for
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
every child and I think that's really
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
critical right because it is important
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
for to honor the child and ensure that
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
their expressed interest is heard in the
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
court but it is also critical that their
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
best interest be represented in the
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
court and a partnership between the two
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
working together for the child is when
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
we see the best work done and the most
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
successful outcomes and so with the work
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
that they did and
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing how Harmony was placed with
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
her father they recognized that in that
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
case there was an attorney but the
 
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
missing link was also having a casa rep
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
representation so I I do believe and and
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
hold firm in my conversations with with
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
them and their full assessment of of how
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
the court proceedings played out in
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that it is very pertinent
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we make sure we maintain the casa
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
program while adding these attorneys to
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
children thank you Miss Sanchez thank
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
comments what's that oh there you
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
are good afternoon Representatives I'm
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
Erin krian I'm the general counsel for
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire judicial branch um I I
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank everyone for for having sent me
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
their their drafts since your last
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
meeting um and for accurately
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
representing what I told them which is
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
that of course the courts don't stand in
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
the shoes of the legislature when it
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
comes to making a policy decision uh you
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
weigh these interests and you write the
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
law and we will apply uh what you write
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
and we typically limit our commentary to
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
issues of what the court can do and can
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
enforce and whether there is a question
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
for us about what you are intending and
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
what you want to have happen when the
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute is applied um typically I would
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
say the larger the change in the law the
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
the better it would be to have great
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
guidance from the legislature about what
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
it is that you want to change and what
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
you want to see the judges doing um in
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
saying this I'm not saying that this is
 
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
not an issue that is extremely important
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
to the judges that work in this area
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
that they're not extremely passionate
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that ultimately when you weigh all
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
these interests you might not find that
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
one one policy alternative is superior
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
even maybe vastly superior to the other
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's we're we're not commenting because
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
it's not our place but not necessarily
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
because we're telling you that these are
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
the same or that we're indifferent to
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the result um it is it is
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally committed to you to
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
answer this question within our role of
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
how do these things impact the courts as
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
I look over some of the drafts um
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
certainly the draft that says that there
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
will be discretionary appointments is
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
one that the courts can easily
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
administer it is not confusing to us
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
what is being sought in that draft uh
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the other drafts um I
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
think there are questions and I think
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard them come up in the
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
conversation today that there's a term
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
that will be interpreted by the courts
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
that the courts will decide what this
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
will be um you know for example just
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking an example of
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
emergency if you have a vision of what
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
it is that you want that to be or to not
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
be or if you want it to be committed to
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the court or committed
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the discretion of DCF guidance from
 
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
you would be very helpful uh I think one
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
of of the issues that's been raised is
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
that there are not very many Attorneys
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
at this time that that do this kind of
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
work and so it is possible that there
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
would be a situation where the statute
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
calls for mandatory appointment and
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's no attorney available if that's
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
the case what is the guidance that the
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to give the courts on
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
what we would do at that
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
point um if there is going to be an
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
attorney representing the expressed
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
interest of the child in a hearing on
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
their best interests are is the
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
legislature envisioning that at some
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
point the courts could find the express
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
interest trumps the best interest or are
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
you envisioning that the expressed
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
interests would always defer to the best
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
interest uh if you're not expecting that
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
the attorney for the child would
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
participate in a judicatory hearing
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
would they file a motion to participate
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
would there be a
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
standard like a low one or a high one
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances that would
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
need to be demonstrated there are
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
questions here that I think we do have
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
because it if this were implemented
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
there would be changes in the way that
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
things are done and we want to make sure
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
we implement the vision that you have of
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
how these problems should be solved uh
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
because although you can solve them by
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
committing some of them to our
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
discretion um we may read your silence
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the issue as mandating a different
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
result or anticipating a different
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
result uh so I I appreciate all of the
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
consider a that you've given to this
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
issue it is a very complicated issue it
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
as as these different groups have
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussed how to address these problems
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
there is a lot that they have brought up
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
for each other that I think was very
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
productive and I appreciated reading
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
about it and I think uh they are some
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
good points to be made but there are
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
still questions that the court would
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
have in how to implement the vision that
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
you have for what the policy in this
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
area should be and so I I want to flag
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
that for you that is our limited um
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
area representative long thank you Mr
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
chairman you probably you probably can't
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
answer this now but if if we could
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
possibly get an answer um in your
 
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
opinion do you believe this would be
 
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
helpful on behalf of the judges or the
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
court system when you say this well like
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
about um attorneys being appointed uh
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
for children just like I asked you about
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
the parental uh yesterday's you know I'm
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
relieve you know we already know that
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
the judges hands a full uh for many
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'm looking to relieve that
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
do you think that this would be one of
 
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.470 align:start position:0%
do you think that this would be one of
those

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
AIDS uh with helping the judge determine
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:53.149 align:start position:0%
AIDS uh with helping the judge determine
issues

01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is a very difficult question I do
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
think that when I first reviewed the
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
language about offering more types of
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
discretionary appointment it's hard to
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
see how that would be harmful because if
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
the court ever thought it was harmful in
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
any particular circumstance they would
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
not appoint so it's difficult to see
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
what a negative side of that would be uh
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of a mandatory appointment it's
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a negative but if you
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney available or they
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
are allowed to argue Express interests
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
versus best interest it raises questions
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
for the judge that might be difficult to
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
deal with so I I don't want to suggest
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
that it would always no matter what is
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
provided if there's an expansion of
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
attorney rights that it would be easy
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
for the courts to administer um but
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly in terms of offering more
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
discretion it's hard to see how there's
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
a downside on discretion we just want to
 
01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that we would appropriately
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
handle any mandatory requirements that
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
you impose okay thank
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:58.189 align:start position:0%
you impose okay thank
you

01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
Miss it's krian yes sir I want to make
 
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
sure I said that correctly um Miss krian
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the um the bill there's a fiscal note
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
that has all zeros in it because there
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
there's but there's a very I believe a
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
strong comment from the judicial Council
 
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
stating what the challenges are and and
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
what what you just recounted if I may is
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
what is being stated in the in that
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
section of the proposed
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
Bill and without speaking for the
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
judicial Council they do pay for these
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys right now the parental
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are appointed so it's it's
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
very likely they their funds that would
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
be implicated if there's an expansion of
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
appointments so they the issues they
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
raise in terms of availability of either
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
funds or attorneys are are certainly um
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
issues which they're poised to comment
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
on and as uh as representative long has
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
stated clearly
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have a judge capacity issue uh to
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
meet the cases outside of having a a
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
wait list that could go on at nauseum I
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
would I would imagine is um do you have
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
would you have any guidance relative to
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
the gal uh Silo of resources being
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
expanded versus an
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
attorney the attorney Silo when that's
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not available what is what
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
would be what is the the alternative
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
strategy when the representation is
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
clearly needed or there's there's no one
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
no one there in this case for the
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
subject subject that we're talking about
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
here the young young children that's a
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous challenge in terms of funding
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
the the limited resources that a state
 
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
always has to spend and how it spends
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
them and also our National Labor
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
shortage there is no area that is not
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
impacted by a lack of talent a lack of
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
people that we can attract into public
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
service while they're very very very
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
desirable in private service I was uh
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
talking today and seeking to answer some
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions from a hearing yesterday about
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
Guardians Ed lium about our current um
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
status of the guardian of lighten
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
program and we have not been taking in
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
new recruits very frequently for the
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
last few years um it has been a
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
challenge attracting the the the gardens
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
that let them that appear in the
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
parenting cases typically that are
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
typically paid by the parties we just
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
have not been able to attract a lot of
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
new people into that profession so that
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
is a that is a challenge I'm not sure
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't a shortage in other
 
01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
areas as well but we certainly do have
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
some institutions that already exist we
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
have Guardians at light and we have a
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
certifying board we have CA there are
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are structures that exist um but
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
you're right we're impacted by a
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
resource and and a and a Personnel issue
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
in many
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
areas and that being stated is and
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
passing know and passing a methodology
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
to meet the this challenge that we have
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
without appropriate fun funding and let
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
alone if the funding's there if you
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the the Professional
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
Resources individuals to fill that
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
need how are we meeting that how is that
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
being met
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
now I my understanding in terms of the
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
the parenting attorneys who typically
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
appear under the statute's current
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to appoint parents have
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
just been decreased by about two that I
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
think went to go work for GCF and I know
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we are we are facing a very real
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that we are not going to
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
meet some of the existing mandatory
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
appointments in the very near future we
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that won't happen and I
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
know that there are are folks that are
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
working on recruiting people and and
 
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get more talent but that was
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we notice um with
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
this proposal speaking not at all on
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
whether it is a good policy idea is the
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
courts probably will need guidance on
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
what they do if there is not an attorney
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
available for a mandatory
 
01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
appointment and then they
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh a unique opportunity to have have you
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
here for this so you got gu is on
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
reading the bill along with our
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
professionals do we need to make a
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
change on this right now I want ask you
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
right now do we need better services for
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
our children for children
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
families if we don't if we don't have
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
these in other resources to support it
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
where it's like a false commitment
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
unless we have the com the funding and
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
the the have the professionals ready to
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
be there when the when the judge uh
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
makes makes that DEC makes a decision
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
for representation for the children in
 
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.109 align:start position:0%
for representation for the children in
these

01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh in these family court cases that's a
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
great question I you you have
 
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I wouldn't want to direct
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
you as as to how to handle those issues
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether you would want to handle one
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
part of the issue first and and then
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
expand from there I I I couldn't say the
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
the best way for you to handle that
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
challenge but I think it is a challenge
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
and it's one that I know some of the
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
folks have flagged as well which is you
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
have your idea of what might be the
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
perfect system and you have the question
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
of whether you would um Implement that
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible in a a well-funded
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
Consolidated measure or whether you
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
would try to do interim measures and
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
work towards something which might have
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
the advantage of giving you some
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
feedback on what works and whether there
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
are unexpected challenges but also has a
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
negative that you're not necessarily
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
getting everything that you want right
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
away um that that's that is a very
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
difficult question I do not envy the
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
situation that you are in in
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh that change well one one last point
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
to have to get the benefit of your
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
guidance on uh and I'll preclude it with
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
this comment in in all bills there's a
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
May and a shall and uh in this in the
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
presented it was saying that there may
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
be a appointment and then that but at
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
the end it then it shall be there's a
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
shall be entitled you're entitled but
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
you may be a
 
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
pointed is is when we're looking at
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation here should the
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
word shall be a standard to ensure the
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh I call the different silos of
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility know they have to perform
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
so there's not a I change my mind I
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to do it even though even
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
though others directed you needed to
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
until it comes to a criteria that says
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
if it's not available and by available
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
meaning for funding you know and if the
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
funding is not there to provide the
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
resources what's your view on that there
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
we certainly Implement both types of
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
statutes we Implement statutes that have
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
a May um and give discretion uh or wait
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
till resources are in place and we
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
Implement some statutes which are an
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
absolute lock that something has to be
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
done it shall be done the legislature
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
has decided that the courts should not
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
have discretion in that area and some of
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
those are extremely appropriate uh so
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that you would never need
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
a sh um to say you shall appoint uh an
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
attorney for an Indigent criminal
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
defendant that that shall happen
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh if you do not have the
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
resources in place I could see that that
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be difficult so if if you are
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
going to mandate that the court shall do
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
something and the resource is not
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
available I would suggest giving an
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
alternative for what the court would do
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
if there's if that resource is not
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
available yeah it's interesting what
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
that you just referred to was shall for
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
Indigent criminals but may for children
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
there are many there are many issues
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
like this in our law that the
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to have an attorney for an
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
Indigent criminal defendant is in the us
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
and state constitution so it is not
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature could
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
choose to obate if they wanted to that
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
is something that we must do or else we
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
will have the case will the conviction
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
if there is one will not stand um this
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
is an issue which I understand that
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
states have there is not a
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate which is not to
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
say that one could not be passed by our
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
citizens or ultimately interpreted to
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
exist but at this moment there is not
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
one um and so it is committed to the
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
legislator's discretion which again is
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
not to say that there is not something
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
you will determine that Justice requires
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
be done in the case um but that is that
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
is a distinction legally between those
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
two different
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
situations thank you very much uh
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
chairman so I think I heard you say that
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
if it's discretionary then uh make clear
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
our intent uh so we're getting what we
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
intended to get uh okay and also um with
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the effective date they like
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
to see the beginning January of the
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
following year so so any effective date
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
should be January of 2024 January first
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
does that give enough time well it
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't give enough time yeah
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
it' be 25 okay yeah if you're looking at
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
January 2025 in terms of our training of
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
our judges I believe we could do it in
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
that time period in terms of making sure
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
that you go through the budgetary
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
process with regard to the needs of the
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
judicial Council will have in funding um
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
I would defer to you I think you may
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
have more information about how you
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
would ensure that the mandates that you
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
have are
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
funded okay thank you thank
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
you I just was going to make a comment
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
on that is I found it just in the past
 
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
that when there is a new uh requirement
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
for spending it's the next budget cycle
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
so it's what we we put the policy in
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
place but it's moot if it requires a
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
funding uh component until the budget is
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
heard and
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
25 or or the next budget cycle unless
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
there's a executive order to move money
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
from a from one location to another we
 
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
from a from one location to another we
fund

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much thank you did we
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
something put that button yeah thank you
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Jay Bucky I'm
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
currently the deputy director of the
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
judicial Council um as I was saying I
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a name tag yet because I'm
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
quite new taking over for Richard San
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
perel uh and I'll take over as executive
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
director on November 2nd and uh of
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
judicial Council judicial Council yes um
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to add just a couple things since
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
I heard our agency mentioned our my main
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
role to is to listen to the legislation
 
01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
see what the impact would be but I want
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
to add a couple things since the fiscal
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
note had been referenced and just a
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of more Nuance in terms of
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
the uh for the judicial Council the
 
01:38:32.669 --> 01:38:32.679 align:start position:0%
degrees of appointment and what that
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
language would necessarily mean and I'll
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
just start off um briefly by talking
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
about for the judicial Council the big
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
difference between uh a right to counsel
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
one moment are you an attorney yes sir
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay attorney uh let's see Buckingham
 
01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
move that mic right to your face now
 
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want anyone to miss your
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
word words here okay thank you as you
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
can tell it's my first time at this desk
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I can't uh great
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so for our agency the difference
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
would be um between having a right to
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
counsel and then a right to appoint a
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
counsel that would be a major difference
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of expending resources just by
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
way of analogy um the way I think it
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to think about it is
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
for people who are accused of speeding
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
tickets um DUIs you know minor
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors like that you have a right
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
to counsel in those cases if you can
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer you have a right to have
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
one in those cases um however in a class
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor case or a felony case you
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
have the right to appointed Council
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
which was what was referenced by uh
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
attorney krian um so that would be the
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
difference in the language that would
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
matter for resources because if someone
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
has a right to appointed Council then
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
obviously our agency would have an
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to expend resources to uh
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
fund those attorneys so that that
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
language would be very important if
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's a right to an attorney um but
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
but it's not a right to to an appointed
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
attorney our read of that would be you
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the right to have state
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
funds expended for that attorney unless
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
we received um some other order to the
 
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.950 align:start position:0%
we received um some other order to the
contrary

01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh in terms of funding
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
generally I think our fiscal note was
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the funding was indeterminant and
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
because um the way it's currently
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
written is it didn't create a new right
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
to appointed Council if it did obviously
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
that would create a more substantial
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
need resources however I would know that
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
there would be you know regardless uh of
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether that language is included or not
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
anytime there's a uh a new right to
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
council or a new opportunity for Council
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
to be appointed that would uh
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
necessitate an addictional expenditure
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
of resources and I think you all already
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
touched on the need for having an
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
additional time period so that we could
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
seek funding and have that approved so
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
that would be available and also to uh
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
seek and procure additional training
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
resources for attorneys because that
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be appointed excuse me important
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's it's been mentioned
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
already that there is and continues to
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
be uh an issue with obtaining lawyers
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
who provide these services and cases
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
obviously they're important cases and
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
having the right training and the right
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys is also important um but
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
finding the appropriate attorneys to
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
take these kinds of cases throughout the
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
state it can be difficult you know
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
there's not especially in more rural
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
parts of the state it can be hard to
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
find attorneys who will take these cases
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
so um there is a resource issue there
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
and um whatever the you know the
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do we will do our
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
best to execute that Vision um but I
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide a bit of context
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
there in terms of the different degrees
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
of what level of funding what level of
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
passed thank you attorney Buckingham and
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
um do you have a copy of the the five
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
you no I don't believe I do okay well go
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
from memory then maybe you read it but
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
um when it when you were saying the
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
difference between the right to council
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the right to you say appointed or
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
appointive appointed appointed councel
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
that would need you recommend that we
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
and looking how to move something
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
forward here is to put language in law
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
that made that right if that's a
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
definite cause and effect that when
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
asked it shall
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
happen by by how you describe it am I or
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
or not just just to be clear I think at
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
this point I would just say that it
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
would make a difference in terms of the
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
resources necessary so if if it's
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
written that there's a right to have a
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
lawyer appointed then that would be one
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
thing if there's a right to counsel
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
that' be another thing or do I have
 
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:42.709 align:start position:0%
that' be another thing or do I have
sorry

01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
just just the last oh did the attorney
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
give you a copy I she pointed out that I
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
didn't I was looking at the statute not
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
the House books excuse me oh oh well yes
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
I have it the house bill is the
 
01:42:56.669 --> 01:42:56.679 align:start position:0%
authority having jurisdiction yes thank
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you for supporting
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
that that I just to go to the last the
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
last line uh well well it's three um
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
where it says the council indicates Etc
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's two sentences right
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
there and it was just where the bill
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
does not direct a court to appoint
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
counsel and does not include a public
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
funding source for such representation
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
that's when when you're providing your
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
guidance there that would be something
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
that would need to be in in a a bill
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
narrative to ensure that this does take
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
place and then would require funding to
 
01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
place and then would require funding to
be

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
present was am I saying that that's what
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
that's directing us yes exactly so if if
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
the intent was to create a right to an
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
appointed to appointed counsel that
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
language would need to be explicit and
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
and have to be changed and and by
 
01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
explicit just to get your guidance here
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
what else uh would
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
need would need to be added to that oh
 
01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
it might say not to this per se but the
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
comment of um the right
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
to to appoint
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
Council and then to ensure that the
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
funding is there because then it's moved
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise the funding wouldn't be there
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
to pay for
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
it when what narrative would need to be
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill for that to happen would
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
would you have a recommendation on that
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
I think um in the first instance i'
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
probably want to take a look and consult
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
with the current executive director and
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
maybe provide a written resp response to
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
with our suggested language again at
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
this point I wouldn't be taking a
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
position either way but we could
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
certainly provide a written response
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
that which would indicate what language
 
01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
we would uh we would read as creating a
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
right to appointed Council yeah I asked
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
that because I wouldn't want it to be
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
quote under appeal after the fact you
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
know when it said well you didn't ask
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
the authority right here like yourself
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
on how what would be a correct narrative
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
should this move forward so that's why I
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
was asking uh your guidance in that
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
regard certainly I I can also take a
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
moment moment right now to uh consult
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
with the chair of the judicial council
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
is here as well I could consult with her
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
and get back to you but I do think
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps our you know in terms of my
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
preference today since we don't we
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
didn't prepare a revised version we can
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
only point out what our understanding of
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
the law is as written we certainly be
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
happy if the count if the committee
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
would like us to come up with language
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
that would mandate an attorney we could
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
do that whether or not the committee
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
should do that obviously that's up to
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
you but we could certainly provide
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
language that we think would be
 
01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.350 align:start position:0%
language that we think would be
unambiguous

01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
unambiguous
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
well what we have uh we have the uh
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
children and family law is uh making a
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations on this retained bill in
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the 31st of
 
01:45:35.310 --> 01:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
October is uh so then I ask is that
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
something you could get to the
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee certainly uh prior I mean
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible so and then we
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
can we'll decide well they decide what's
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
that the next steps to do sure then we
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
can get that we can get that J on that n
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
very quickly yes right thank you

any anything f for attorney
Bucky

01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to add sort of a
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
little context because it might help um
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of of some of the
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
numbers Kasa currently has
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
127 Children and Youth that are placed
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
in residential
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
facilities um so and we estimate that we
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
have about 75 to 80% % of those total
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of children from Ab only
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
involved in abuse and neglect
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings 127 are in residential
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
facilities the new director of DCF is
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
very committed and I think Cassandra
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
could speak to this too to um
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating as many residential
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
placements as possible and putting those
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
kids into foster care kinship care or
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
other resources within their their
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
community so there is that movement but
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
just so you have some con text of what
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
the numbers of attorney
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
representation um for kids for Children
 
01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
and Youth and residential it that's what
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
our numbers are at this at this present
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
time 127 127 children that are in
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
residential placement yeah and is that
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire only that's new H well
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
no some of the 39 of those children and
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
I and that that in those numbers are
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
about two weeks old so it may have
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
changed but we are really working hard
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
at getting our children who are in outof
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
State placement back to either placement
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
within the New England region or within
 
01:47:59.589 --> 01:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so um that's
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
and that is happening we're seeing more
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
kids coming home so third but at the mo
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
at the moment not at the moment it's 39
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
out of state it's 127 in residential
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
whether in state or out of state or
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
within New England um but 39 of those
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
are Beyond are outside of the the state
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
so just to keep that number in mind it
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
just gives you a sense of what potential
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
attorney how many attorneys we could be
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
looking at if this is mandatory um
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
without developing a pool of of
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
well-trained and qualified attorneys in
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
so rep representative long yeah just
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to both proposals are they
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
replacing the whole
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
bill uh it looks like it looks like um
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
that was yeah that was attorney
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
rosenberg's is that was the intent okay
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
so yours is I think that the the jpg1
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of amends the first section of
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and then takes out the
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
second section and replaces that second
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
you anything further uh from all our
 
01:49:22.679 --> 01:49:25.589 align:start position:0%
you anything further uh from all our
professionals

01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
happened you've had
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
enough oh jeez I'm not feeling the love
 
01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden what happened it's not
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
now if we could just talk in general
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
without asking anyone questions you guys
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
have been so gracious with us on all of
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
our questions and thank you you know I
 
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
have to the rest of my um subcommittee
 
01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.990 align:start position:0%
have to the rest of my um subcommittee
here

01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously this is this is an
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
issue and gosh even there's a story on
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
Netflix right now taking care of Maya
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
where a girl was um you know taken from
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
her mom and you know lots of different
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
things and so I have concerns about
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
cases like that not only where kids are
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes rightfully taken out of an
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
abusive home but also when they're
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately taken out of a home they
 
01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be where they're you know a
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
doctor may be overreacting or there's a
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
lot of different
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
cases you know when we get into this I I
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
keep saying this it's like aable you
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
like think you get a piece of it and
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
then it seems to grow at bare minimum we
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
have to take this 30-day window out we
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
have to let the judges you know be able
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
to do this whenever I am highly
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know what in the J
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
jrpg draft also um I do think that we
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
need something like that I'm I'm so
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about our limited resources we
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
have in New
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and saying shall and what
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to do you know in a perfect
 
01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
world we would say okay every kiddo
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
should be able to do this I think that's
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
important especially if the lawyer is
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
working in concert with Casa you know or
 
01:51:11.709 --> 01:51:11.719 align:start position:0%
the other child Advocates because I
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
think that's necessary we can't only
 
01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
have a legal brain in there um I'm just
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
not I'm really I I think
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I think um there's a
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
lot of information here I I am worried
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
about resources and I think am I getting
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
that right and you can just say yes or
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
no Kasa that is your your one of your
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
largest concerns about this larger one
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
is the amount of resources that we have
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
and that we could hang this
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
up and this is another we have a lot of
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bills that come to us
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
that in wanting to fix a lot of problems
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
we can make more problems S no matter
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
how we decide to do this especially
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
after just hearing from judicial
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
counsel if we don't word this exactly
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
right or if we don't have a sunset kind
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
of plan or something where we give our
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
ourselves time to build these
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
resources we can cause a massive problem
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
I do think it needs to happen I do think
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
that we need this representation for
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
children especially ones who are at risk
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
I think we've kind of defined enough in
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
here at least for me in this session
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not in the bill so much about what
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
that at risk looks like but I do know
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
that kids once they get into a treatment
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's its own trauma once they get like
 
01:52:34.069 --> 01:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
in a residential treatment or whatever
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not we bring them back
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
immediately because it was a mistake or
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
we give them a lawyer once they're there
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's a problem because I think
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that is a trauma right there um
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
that particular thing I just we're not
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
there yet and I it's unfortunate that
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's a divide in the people that we
 
01:52:54.069 --> 01:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
we really do look to you for a lot of
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
advice and I think it's all good advice
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody's wrong in this I
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
think we have a complicated system with
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
our lack of funds our lack of funds our
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
lack of resources part of that is we're
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
a small state
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
um I just I I don't know what it takes
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
us to get to a final place but I do
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
think at the bare minimum we've got to
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
take off that 30-day restraint that we
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
currently have on judges um but anyway
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's just my kind of musings I guess
 
01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.950 align:start position:0%
that's just my kind of musings I guess
on

01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
this um one just one quick question um
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
the 30-day 30-day issue where in the law
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
is that specifically so right now so
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
you'll see it on both of them where
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
they've crossed this out so it's by the
 
01:53:33.079 --> 01:53:34.910 align:start position:0%
they've crossed this out so it's by the
first

01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um where it is so it's by the first
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
uh gosh I don't even have it now I mean
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm was just looking at the so the
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
by the oh the dispositional orders so
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
dispositional orders is usually within
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
30 days that's why I said 30 days it
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't say 30 days it says
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
dispositional orders so right now as it
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
stands they would the judge would need
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
to do it by dispositional orders which
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
is generally within that first 30 days I
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a legal
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that that be within the
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
first 30 days the dispositional
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.079 --> 01:54:18.669 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
any ERS so so the recommendation for
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
both sides to take that out so that it
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
can happen prior to the disposition
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
orders which is within 30 days of the
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
right exactly so that's the seat belt
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so right now there's a seat Bel on
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
our judges and I think some judges are
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
going above and beyond anyway but right
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
now that's not as clear so that's why I
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
say the 30 days I would hate to think
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
because a lot of cases when you have
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect you have other things
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find out in the
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
first 30 days it could take a few months
 
01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
it could um kids as they're away from
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
their um abuser uh will tend to open up
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
as they realize that that's not normal
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
quote unquote that that's because that's
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
the only thing they know so so many
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
things come out after that first 30 days
 
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
that are imperative that we not have
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
that on there but anyway that's what
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
that was about oh well that being said
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
is if that now that's in rules because
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
thenu the rules aren't here this is
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
showing the policy and then there's the
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
application of the policy that's why I'm
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm always Wonder know where that is but
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
if it's 30 days and all our
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
professionals here have said yes that's
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
the fact uh what um then what would you
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
recommend taking the place of that in
 
01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:36.679 align:start position:0%
rules uh in the Court's rules is that
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
open-ended or or or what would a number
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
be well I'm not sure that we would need
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
because I this is one of those cases
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
where I think the judges who are seeing
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
all the different aspects of the case or
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
as many as are getting presented to them
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's their their discretion at that
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
point because we don't know um you know
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a kiddo has been sent to
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment now we're three
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
years out or something you know that
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
they the judge should be able to say you
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
know wait a second we need to do this so
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
that would be their discretion I would
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
not put um a time constraint and
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually so kasa's Bill while it while I
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
do think it's bare minimum on what we
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
should do it does actually um in their
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh in 535 it takes that out or their
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment to 535 I don't know there's so
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
many amendments here but um it actually
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
takes that out you'll see where it takes
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
out for dispositional
 
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.270 align:start position:0%
out for dispositional
orders

01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think that we would put
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
another time constraint I'm not sure if
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful but basically the
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
casa Amendment currently 169
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
C10 um and I misplaced my glasses the 2A
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
2A the language only allows
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
a judge discretionary appointment um if
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict between what the
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
child and the guardian and lium
 
01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
represent as stated interest and be best
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
interest and if there is a conflict with
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
the dispositional orders and as
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Greg referenced the
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing is in the early
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
part of the case so after the
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing and the adjudicatory
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
hearing the very next hearing is the
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole another potentially 12
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
months even years potentially that that
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
can happen in the life of a case so for
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
all all of us who are concerned in cases
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
where Casa has tried has filed motions
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
for Council to be appointed we're
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes three years into the case
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
where a child um disregulated could had
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
to be removed from multiple foster homes
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then was placed in an out ofate
 
01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
facility and so we're even at this point
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
the that the parents rights may have
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
been terminated but that 169c case is
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
still open so here we are 3 years later
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
that child wants to come home Casa is
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
saying we want that child to come home
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
we think it's in the child's best
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
interest because current statute reads
 
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
conflict and we're beyond the
 
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.629 align:start position:0%
conflict and we're beyond the
dispositional

01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
dispositional
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
hearing there are Judges who deny that
 
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
motion for counsel and say my hands are
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
tied we're too late in the case
 
01:58:22.109 --> 01:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
and the the guardian at Liam and the
 
01:58:22.119 --> 01:58:23.270 align:start position:0%
and the the guardian at Liam and the
child

01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
agree so I'm sorry M well where in law I
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
mean specifically because I'm not seeing
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
it in well I'm just looking at the
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
documents I have what's the number and
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
location for what you just
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
stated I just can't find my glasses one
 
01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.830 align:start position:0%
stated I just can't find my glasses one
169

01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
169
 
01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.589 align:start position:0%
169
c102

01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
C all right so we're what we're what KAS
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
is requesting is some of that limiting
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
language to to be stricken and we think
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty easy statutory fix and by
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking out the language that we
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
recommend it would give judges
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
discretion to appoint Council for
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
children at any point in the case and
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
would give judges discretion to appoint
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys even if the guardian at Liam
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the child are on the same page and I
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's the example I'm giving
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees this child should be in
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
a a less restrictive environment but you
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
we're filing you know a motion for for
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
an attorney to be appointed and the
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
judge is saying we're too far along I
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't do it you want to see what your
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
comfort level is on on this one and and
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is the discretion issue uh for
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
judges has been a uh my my bias in the
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
discuss in multiple discussions on these
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
bills we've been seeing is what is that
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
um in question is how much discretion a
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
judge has and how much should be um
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
directed by by law
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
is this discretion in this case you're
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
that something you discretion as to when
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
an action would take place uh here you'd
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
be you're saying that that's the more
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate is to have the judges decide
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
how quickly or not how quickly u a
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
direction relative to dispositional
 
02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.709 align:start position:0%
direction relative to dispositional
orders

02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding where we are right now
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes I mean in our cases our judges are
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're there for every step of the way
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
and we feel with the lack of resources
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
now that the limited attorneys we have
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
should be appointed to those cases where
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
they're really needed that's where we
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
should start and the judges so parties
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the child can ask the guardian at lium
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
can ask the parent can ask and judges
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
right now sitting in those cases have
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
discretion to say yep and we're we all
 
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
may be arguing to that uh but yes so
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
where we think we think it that's where
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
it should start okay and as rep Greg
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out relative to his 30 days is
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
is that the dis to use the word
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
discretion here for the judge could take
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
up to 30 days for a decision or in or
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
with taking it as this as we put it
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
right in as you're hearing in the
 
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
amendment what the law reads is whether
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
or not there's a conflict with the
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
dispositional orders and that happens to
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
occur at the time of the dispositional
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
hearing so the law doesn't reference 30
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
days from from the adjudicatory hearing
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
it just references the dispositional
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
orders so it's cas's position if that
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
language is just as stricken uh that we
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
would get to a really good first step so
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
that children right now who need
 
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys and we have kids right now who
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
really do but there are Judges who feel
 
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied that this law is
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
tying their hands and they can't appoint
 
02:01:46.069 --> 02:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
and and just one clarification point
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
then is does that indicate that time's
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the essence
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
when you have this you know taken that
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
out that for the the sense of message to
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
to the the message that the status of uh
 
02:01:59.790 --> 02:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues is as quickly as
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
possible KAS From kasa's perspective we
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
would like this we do think there are
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
children right now who would benefit
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
from Council Council right now Casa
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
files motions for Council to be
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
appointed in some cases they're
 
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes denied because because of this
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
law okay I'm not sure if that answered
 
02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.870 align:start position:0%
law okay I'm not sure if that answered
your

02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
question so yeah clarification on the uh
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
30 days we're looking at 60 days also so
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
is it placement at home that's 30
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
days I I'm not sure what where the day
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
reference is coming from uh 169 C 15 is
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
that C15 y col 15
 
02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:45.639 align:start position:0%
the we're referencing that particular
 
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
part of 169 days that they're still at
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
home but 30 days they've been taken up I
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess from kasa's perspective
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
the the Striking of the language would
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
make it clear that that there shouldn't
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
be Court the hearings unfortunately are
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
not always scheduled exactly when they
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
should be um so having a day limitation
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
helpful oh well you were
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
successful yeah I come on up so we
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
you I don't think that there is a
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
limitation on dates I think the 30 days
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
sort have got a little bit confused
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
because um the the dis we just know that
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
the dispositional order is within 30
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
days of the judicatory I think we can
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
put 30 days aside and just say that the
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
ca Amendment would allow discretionary
 
02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
appointment of council at any stage of
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
the proceedings and I think we don't
 
02:03:43.229 --> 02:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
need to talk about the 30 or 60 days
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
because I just don't think it's relevant
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
to that analysis I do just want to put
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
forward one one maybe alternative one of
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
the things that I've been hearing
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
throughout this is that there's a lot of
 
02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on the policy the policy of
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of kids um
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
and and you've heard that from certainly
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
the folks that I work with from the OCA
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
and even from Casa that there's a lot of
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
agreement that attorneys can add value
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
to this process and that the issue
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
really seems to be a resource constraint
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a dispute about the policy
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
which I think puts us in a really good
 
02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:19.719 align:start position:0%
place and so one thing I think the
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
committee could consider is doing the
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
discretionary appointment of council so
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking that first piece and making an
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
effective date now you know within the
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
next you know within the next year
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 but then um put push
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
out an effective date of a mandatory
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
appointment because I think what the
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
concern of of lawyers are is that
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers aren't going to train up to do
 
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
this work unless they know that they're
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to be there's going to be work for
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
them to do and so if there's an
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
effective date that's pushed out that
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
would give us the opportunity to say
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers there are there's work for you
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
coming in the next couple of years let
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
us get you trained let us work with the
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
law school there's lots of lawyers
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
sitting in this room willing to train up
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
new lawyers to do this work and so if
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
that date of the mandatory right is
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
pushed out we wouldn't run up
 
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily against um a restriction on
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not a mandatory appointment
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
would actually result in an attorney
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing available but we
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
could work really hard to make that
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
happen when I hear 150 cases the case
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
load at the public defender office is
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
120 at any given time I don't think
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good number um I think it
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
should be much lower but we're talking
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
about two maybe three lawyers we're not
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
talking the the the number 150 sounds
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
like a lot but in terms of litigating
 
02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
these types of cases there are lawyers
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
who handle a lot higher case loads and
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
do a pretty good job um so I don't think
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's unmanageable so I just want to to
 
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:50.679 align:start position:0%
throw that out there as an option since
 
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of agreement on
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
policy Miss uh Michelle wangr sorry New
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal
 
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
assistance spell your last name it's w n

02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
n
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
yes um just what we provided just am I
 
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
doing uh be quick here where it said
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
under 169 C15 hearings must be held
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
within 60 days from filing unless the
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
child is out of the home and then it's
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
30 days right but this would this the
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
first part of the amendment would allow
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
appointment of councel at any stage so
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
it it could be at the preliminary
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
hearing it could be at the adjudicatory
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
hearing it could be at the dispositional
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
it could be at a review hearing so I
 
02:06:37.229 --> 02:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't think under this amendment that
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees on I don't think there's
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
issue if you notice on the jrpg they
 
02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
actually he took out the exact same
 
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
thing that cost a debt on the other one
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that this is something that there is
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
an agreement on this is not a split the
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
baby this is like everybody agrees but I
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
do think that it's a bare minimum at
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
this point like I don't it doesn't solve
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
all the issues I do actually like the
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
idea of pushing out this other mandatory
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
part to where we can make sure we're
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
building resources we certainly can't
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
spring it on everybody but um it is a
 
02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
bare minimum start I do like that there
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
is agreement on
 
02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
that and the definition of bare minimum
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
is the amendment from Kasa
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
Kasa we like to think of it as a good
 
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.109 align:start position:0%
Kasa we like to think of it as a good
first

02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
start that's a the first step First Step
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
because start goes to a stop immediately
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
when you leave the room good first step
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
yeah okay anything so yeah if I can just
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman uh so I on
 
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
the other hand I look at policy period
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
policy pure policy what is in the best
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
interest of the child I'm not concerned
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
of what the cost is is I I just need to
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
know what the general court thinks is in
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
the best interest um I speak to a lot of
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
people uh uh talking about the Sonona
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
Youth Center you know it's costing us a
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars a child I say fantastic
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
as long as that million dollars is
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
delivering opportunities for that child
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
that child deserves that million dollars
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um so hopefully we
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
can hopefully we can um come to a
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
consensus between us that we could
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
advise the full committee uh and
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
reaching a consensus to where
 
02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
um like like representative uh Greg said
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's still some improvement that we
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
could we could do now um not the whole
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
bite uh but not the smaller of the piece
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
either um so I think there's some um
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
absolute best interest interest uh that
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we should be able to deliver to
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
kids

02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to hear
 
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.189 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to hear
representative

02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
Goan another quality decision by our
 
02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
Goan another quality decision by our
staff

02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.310 align:start position:0%
staff
member

02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:24.030 align:start position:0%
member
myself

02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
I think that we had the professionals
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
come in and tell us um what their
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint was they put something in
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
front of us that they believe is going
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
to address issues right now that need to
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
be addressed in the court and I'm um I'm
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
for supporting what I'm being given so
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
the larger I'm just wondering if there's
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
a way like you said to break it up and
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
then having the two different start
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
dates um for one and then the other but
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
I don't I just want to make sure that we
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't take this hard work that they've
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
done and forget that it was put in front
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
of us so I would love um we have some
 
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
other avenues that we can look at um as
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
far as getting the second half through
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
um if that's not a possibility then I
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
would I would prefer to um take the
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
hand

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman move moving forward um it
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
looks like we may schedule another
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
meeting I mean I'm fine with that this
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
this is important enough for me I'll do
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
three meetings tues um okay so we'll
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
schedule another meeting and we have
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
answers coming forward I believe from uh
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
oh attorne attorney Bucky yeah Buckley
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
Buckley or when it's regal it's Buck oh
 
02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.229 align:start position:0%
Buckley or when it's regal it's Buck oh
it's

02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:51.549 align:start position:0%
it's
Bucky

02:10:51.549 --> 02:10:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay and what was there questions from
 
02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.589 align:start position:0%
okay and what was there questions from
Aaron

02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
Aaron
 
02:10:59.549 --> 02:10:59.559 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
say well what what what we have uh to do
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
that I guess what we have as a challenge
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
here is there is uh our our deadlines
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it's only can be one amendment by
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
the way right that uh that we uh can do
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
and and uh the uh 31st is for the the
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation before the the committee
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
on what that Amendment uh would be and
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's how how now that being said I
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'll just make my comment on this when
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
it comes down there to the financial
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
will that uh well no we can it it's well
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
let me offer this to you it's um I'm one
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
that even though we're a policy
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh we're de facto a a funding
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh we're a finance committee also when
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
we know what what's the what we don't
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
know what these costs would be but that
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
would be the excuse not the excuse that
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
would be the rationale to do nothing
 
02:11:59.470 --> 02:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
after a Bill's passed because the
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
funding isn't available and but in terms
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
of um what we saw first not first I mean
 
02:12:08.430 --> 02:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
what's been presented here in our
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
discussion is uh like the amendment from
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
the caser amendment is doing something
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
at at the at the first thing uh for us
 
02:12:21.549 --> 02:12:21.559 align:start position:0%
to offer for recommendation to have to
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
have this into a formal Amendment and
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
then it's in terms of these other issues
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
which are multi multifaceted here is I I
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'd say we need a study committee for it
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
and the and the reason is because of the
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
financial components that's that's the
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
reason if there's any of the policy
 
02:12:42.750 --> 02:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
issues that could happen without having
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
a funding issue so there's not a reason
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
to delay what what's being recommended
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason being what we don't have
 
02:12:52.669 --> 02:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
qu the money right I a little concern on
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
that then just one last comment is I I
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
had a similar thing in my uh previous
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with the uh uh
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the U developmental
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
disability weight list and that went
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
into a delay mode constantly but and
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
always a quality intent but the funding
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't there and candidly I was the
 
02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:14.559 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee that then made it
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
give it a short version of reality when
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
we did the funding had the had the full
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
package it passed that we haven't had a
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
weight list issue for six seven terms
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
now um but it recognized is is not to
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
think hey we're doing half my words half
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
the job without doing the funding for it
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why I I was looking here
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's a consensus for us of what we
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
can do policy-wise that does not have a
 
02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:39.069 align:start position:0%
can do policy-wise that does not have a
fiscal

02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
impact by by definition and uh and and
 
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
then having a a the study committee have
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
like the full commitment to have U for
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
next well for next year is to have this
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
fully funded so that our court system is
 
02:13:58.109 --> 02:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
not put into a shagrin as I call this
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
say gee we'd like to do it but we can't
 
02:14:02.189 --> 02:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and do it meaning appointment of
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
attorneys or are the costs that it takes
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
for our for our children so I just off
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
of that as a as a concept
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
concept web yeah so so I'm sorry wa a
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
minute I just wanted to remind you that
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
it was brought to our attention that we
 
02:14:23.950 --> 02:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
do the states do have um access to the
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal funding through that title for
 
02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act um to help pay
 
02:14:31.549 --> 02:14:31.559 align:start position:0%
for attorneys for Children and
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
Families yeah which which again fund
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
those are things that would need to be
 
02:14:37.149 --> 02:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
part of the research that's done of how
 
02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
to get in line for that and to make sure
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the funding from the federal
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
government uh is allocated for New
 
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
government uh is allocated for New
Hampshire's

02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
proposing well I always use that it's
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
for the children yes no I understand and
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's but as an aggressive Advocate
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
with manners I have found dealing with
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
faceless bureaucrats you better be fully
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
loaded when you're doing it and that's
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
with with our uh you know I'm not trying
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
to be funny there but that's what I've
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
learned over time is uh is make sure
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing that have the right thing so
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
intellectually we've we've covered our
 
02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
our bases and we have the right answers
 
02:15:17.549 --> 02:15:17.559 align:start position:0%
to say here's the here's the reason for
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
the investment and we want access to
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
this funding for the betterment of our
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
all our C all our citizens regardless of
 
02:15:25.199 --> 02:15:26.709 align:start position:0%
all our C all our citizens regardless of
financial

02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
ability when they come to court but yeah
 
02:15:33.069 --> 02:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
anyway could we long thank you Mr
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
chairman I I so I'm I'm hoping that the
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
general court could take a consensus on
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff whether whether
 
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
there's a payment coming forward or not
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh knowing that you know first of all I
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
I agree uh if this has to go to Finance
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
Finance is going to say yeah we're all
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
set uh we got the budget out you know
 
02:15:54.669 --> 02:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
wait till 25 when we're redoing that
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
budget but I'm I'm wondering if there's
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
is a uh consensus that could be taken
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the general court you know a vote
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the general court saying um saying
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
positively yes um we agree with having
 
02:16:09.719 --> 02:16:10.390 align:start position:0%
positively yes um we agree with having
uh

02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh appointed uh a must um at
 
02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:15.830 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh appointed uh a must um at
some

02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:16:19.229 --> 02:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
level um without without the implication
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
of a without the implication of a
 
02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.430 align:start position:0%
of a without the implication of a
financial

02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
note um I I don't know if that's ever
 
02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
been done um but I mean I I I I learned
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
a lot today with both presentations both
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
sides um and um and I lean towards both
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
sides um and I don't want any of that to
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
go to waste so so um I I mean I I like
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
the effective date
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
scenario uh maybe uh postponing the
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
financial finding out what the
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
federal what feds have to offer um so
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
implement this uh one of
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
24 and then uh take a couple of other
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
bites that we may want uh to implement
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
up oh I'm sorry 125 and then
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
126 it would start yeah the initial
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
would start at 125 right this one here
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
can you that's what the court system
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
obligate oh you can't obligate another
 
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
future future body you know they have to
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
be part of that that's that's that's
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
what I've that's what I've learned thank
 
02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:43.509 align:start position:0%
what I've that's what I've learned thank
you

02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
here okay through through the special
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
Committee of family uh Court
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
Court thank you just a couple things I
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
mean if you're considering like having
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
different start effective dates which
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
would be a really good way of um
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
avoiding this financial Pitfall that
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of one thing to keep in
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
mind is that if you are going to start
 
02:18:16.830 --> 02:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
with the discretionary appointment of
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
councel then jrpg would ask that you
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
also do something that is not very
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
costly at all which is to make sure that
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
children's the foster care children's
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights is amended to reflect
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
that discretionary the right to ask for
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
discretionary appointment of councel so
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
because we see those two things as going
 
02:18:36.599 --> 02:18:37.469 align:start position:0%
because we see those two things as going
hand

02:18:37.469 --> 02:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
inand and the the casa Amendment does
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
not include amending the CH Foster
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights to inform
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
children that this is an Avenue they
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
might decide to
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
pursue what what's the law the law
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
number on that so that's the
 
02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
170g hold on 21 oh okay that's so the
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
idea right so the idea would be to at
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
least you know we that's where we notify
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
children in foster care of they're you
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
know the pan of all the rights that they
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
have if if the inclination is to add
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
this right the right for them to seek
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
discretionary appointment of council
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
then they should be so informed in that
 
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
booklet that they get with all of their
 
02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:26.389 align:start position:0%
booklet that they get with all of their
rights

02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
enumerated please do representative Greg
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if we're not
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
including the stuff on uh
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
placement we you still I I the if if
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
we're just doing the bare minimum and
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
then the placement stuff we're doing for
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
kicking out a little bit um the Bill of
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
Rights would still need to be
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
because because I don't see the
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
placement it does it's not tied just a
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
placement it would say to the children
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
courts have discretion to appoint
 
02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
counsel for you you have a right to ask
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
a court to appoint counsel for you at
 
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
any stage of the
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
proceeding okay and it and it and it
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't well and it could be clear to
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
say that you know that discretion
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the Court's gonna say
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
yes but okay right but it would at least
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
be an accurate um representation of this
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
expansion because it is an expansion
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
right yeah um and then the other thing
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
um just to throw out there is that
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
generally you know in court appointed
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
councils there Council cases there is a
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
cap to what attorneys can generally
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
charge so when we're looking at
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 150 cases a year with like
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
a $2500 cap that's a total of
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
$325,000 for $ 150 cases so it's not
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's not breaking the bank um just so
 
02:20:48.190 --> 02:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
that you know and I understand that one
 
02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
way of dealing with this that and and
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
but the other part of this is that um
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
the fore money the federal money which
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
is there it's not a huge amount you
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
should just know um it's probably around
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
I think we figured out it was around
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
what 12 or
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
14% of that cost so it's not going to be
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
a really huge it'll be it'll it can help
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
but um I just don't want to represent
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
that as like a huge portion of what the
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
cost would be it would help to spray the
 
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
cost and hopefully having kids out of
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
residential facilities would free up
 
02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:32.270 align:start position:0%
residential facilities would free up
some

02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
money Casa uh respectfully request that
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
you just stick with the the casa
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that everybody agrees to part
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the issue with the Bill of Rights
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
from Casa's perspective as we got into
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
the adjudicatory hearing issue that you
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony about so we may
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
get there and I think we we likely will
 
02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
but for now uh it's kasa's position that
 
02:21:57.309 --> 02:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
we should stick with the good uh first
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
step of of the casa
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment and agree to the
 
02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:04.590 align:start position:0%
Amendment and agree to the
commission

02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
divion one yes no divion one is where
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
is the judicial Council would be paying
 
02:23:03.309 --> 02:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
me so the study committee I I probably
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
should have my microphone on would make
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
sense normally I would say oh I don't
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
want to kick it out because it would it
 
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
would take too long I do think that the
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
special committee that we've had on the
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
Family Court has been incredibly
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial the amount of time it's taken
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
would take no longer than if we just put
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
something in and we had to kick it out
 
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
because of Finance anyway so that way it
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
would give us a clearer cut look at what
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
we are actually looking at get some real
 
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
numbers so that like you said in your
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
case where we can then push the entire
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
thing through we don't have a lot of
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hang-Ups here and there so I know that I
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
think a lot of times when we say oh
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be this special
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
commission or whatever I know I thought
 
02:23:47.309 --> 02:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
that like that's so much time but we're
 
02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
already looking at time anyway because
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
um you know just to implement this we
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to overwhelm a
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
system and make it you know bad for
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
people who would normally it would it
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
flow a little easier anyway so I I think
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
that would be a I see where that would
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for sure and I think you
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
did bring it up last time that maybe
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is so big but this is so big and we
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
respect everybody's opinion here and I I
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
always say it's not that we're fighting
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
different battles we're fighting the
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
same battle just in a different way so I
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
think we are are looking at this and I
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
want to really
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
be really be thoughtful on that so I
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
think the commission I that would be my
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
that oh wait a minute there was
 
02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:43.710 align:start position:0%
that oh wait a minute there was
another

02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
yes no no it's Steen well well I'm I say
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
no let's just clarify where we're where
 
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
we are at the moment uh right now is um
 
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
addressing the casa Amendment as the uh
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
as provided to us here to
 
02:25:06.910 --> 02:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
replace uh the uh the amendment that was
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
provided in total the original not
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the the original bill as
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
provided to us and this being uh
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
replacing all doesn't say in here it
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
just says amend one section I should say
 
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
one section of it the rest rest of the
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill are remaining the same well no they
 
02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
intent is to uh their their intent was
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
to replace the whole bill oh replace the
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
whole bill okay it doesn't say that on
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
agreement from everyone that 535 is to
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
not go that's that I know I did get that
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
last time that was the one thing
 
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
everybody agreed on last time was that
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
535 is not
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
workable oh all right yeah I'm I was
 
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
looking for it to replace to re replace
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
it just says amend and to a specific see
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
I actually read what you provided so I
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
read all these things all right but that
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
is that is to um uh replace in total the
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
the bill uh and with what we have here
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation and now and that being
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
would notwithstanding comments to come
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
right now but that would be our
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the uh the full
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee yeah uh on on the
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
31st that's the the product of our our
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
action number one that's our action and
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
the 1A is the establishment of a study
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
committee to to uh to be formally uh
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
appointed immediately and then we meet
 
02:26:33.870 --> 02:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
meet stop meeting immediately and that's
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
also over the summer
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
nextd

02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
sir

02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
should we meet one more time on the 25th
 
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever or or or do you think we'
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
got it I mean I'm I'm I'm looking at
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
what additional non Financial
 
02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
consensus I would say I don't think
 
02:28:04.399 --> 02:28:05.110 align:start position:0%
consensus I would say I don't think
there

02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
is I mean what I've heard here unless
 
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
unless there's an something to add to
 
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
this to to an amendment un that's in
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
that regard yeah yeah picking from the
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
other Amendment
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
something that's not as critical or or
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
not yeah yeah yeah that's I mean I think
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
a study committee now is is good um
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
because uh you know we want to be able
 
02:28:30.750 --> 02:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
to bring something forward uh in the
 
02:28:32.590 --> 02:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
next uh the next
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
B yeah yeah the whole point about on the
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
study is because of the financial issue
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and and that's when we have the
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
full um Mo all the professionals
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
participant in that so that we don't
 
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
something isn't missed and then it
 
02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
become by missed or overlooked not
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
missed it just what and but it takes
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
takes the time to do instead of being
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
under a rush like like this and and uh
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
have all entities spoken for represented
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
and that gives the uh the the weight
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
when the advocacy takes place before the
 
02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
respective committees everyone will be
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
in play and on and on the same page and
 
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
not have a conflict uh on interpretation
 
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
is it a dog or a cat we got to we got to
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
make sure we're on the same
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
page so that so that being said uh oh go
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative B sorry my
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I go back to working in the best
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
interest of the children and I'm
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about dragging it on because
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
how many children are going to fall
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
through the crack or how many children
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
are going to not have their needs met
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
because we're delaying putting forward
 
02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
something that we know that is needed um
 
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I do agree that we have other bills
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
that are going through that have a
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
financial note on them and
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I just think unless we have it down
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we say this is what we need to do
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get done it won't get
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
put in the budget either so I think I'm
 
02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
put in the budget either so I think I'm
just

02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:30:06.990 --> 02:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I would like to just move forward I
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just saying I'm thinking about
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
the children and what they need and
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
pushing it out a year you just have to
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
wonder how many children are not going
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
to have their needs met um and be
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
represented properly
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
um I would be in favor of pushing it
 
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
forward and letting the full committee
 
02:30:23.469 --> 02:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
make a
 
02:30:26.269 --> 02:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
decision well off for one thing in that
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
regard uh the and J looking at the
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
amendment there from Kasa here it is
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
stating and
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
relative uh in representing the
 
02:30:37.389 --> 02:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
expressed interest of the child as the
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
states here is that there they the
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
appointments will take place the
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
question will become in how many cases
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
you have is will there be the money to
 
02:30:47.710 --> 02:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
pay for that attorney attorney to do it
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
and if it's not there it ain't happening
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's and then we we'll be saying
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
well we'll hope it happens because if
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
the funding isn't isn't there it will
 
02:31:00.190 --> 02:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
not take place you know so um so in
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
looking here is at the at the lease that
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
saying when they say may appoint an an
 
02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
attorney that's going to be be driven by
 
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
a uh value judgment based on okay what
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
who who we hiring and then what's the
 
02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
cost of that hiring and does it fit
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
within the current budget that's
 
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
available and uh so this is is looking
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
out after the children and I'm I'm I
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
joined with Miss ball I said I I'm a
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative ball and that's here I
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
have the same uh commitment to it
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking after those who need assistance
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
and doing it doing it now but I I am
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm not one is to say passing a
 
02:31:39.070 --> 02:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill and then it doesn't have the tools
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
to effectually apply the bill in this
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
case the the cost of the service and uh
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm looking here is how
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
do we get this get this started so that
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's a commitment to a resolution and
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
not a constant Battle of U where the
 
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
funds come at any given
 
02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
time on on
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
this representative long thank thank you
 
02:32:05.469 --> 02:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah I mean I'm feeling like
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing all I can is the way I'm
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
feeling um and I I agree that pass the
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
policy uh and then let Finance know that
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is what we're looking for um you
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how if I'm on finance
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
I'll find it but I'm not on fance so
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's your job to find it um I you know
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
because I I
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
I you know I I get that scenar I've had
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
plenty of bills pass where Finance just
 
02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
says yeah we don't have the money and
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't the money we do have
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to put towards this and
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
I had to accept that but at least I gave
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
them my opinion this is or the state
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
gave them their opinion this the policy
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee gave gave them their opinion
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is what we need um you know and
 
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of uh there's a couple
 
02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
advantages I think for the uh children
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the um appointment of
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys um that I I agree is gonna is
 
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
g to be give the state of New Hampshire
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
Better situated uh with with helping
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
helping giving these kids
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities um so yeah so
 
02:33:18.269 --> 02:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
it could be a discussion in the full
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
committee I guess because I I'm you
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
know what what what can we add from from
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
if I may from uh the from the other
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
uhg on on that as part of the ca draft
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment what
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
else was yeah um would you recommend I
 
02:33:41.070 --> 02:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
mean actually I I like the option of the
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
effective dates um I think that's
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
helpful uh and and I need to confer with
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh what would be no what would be the
 
02:33:58.750 --> 02:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
what what would be not the major
 
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
controversial issues but something that
 
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
will allow us to get the general court
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
to agree uh to to have a stance on some
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
issues that we want affected um
 
02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:25.469 align:start position:0%
issues that we want affected um
the

02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
allow it would
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
allow piece of it to go through the
 
02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
budet get and
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
then the bar to build up the attorney
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually would some of those
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
administrative that you heard about and
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
and enable this to move forward in a way
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that a judge they will be to we think
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
that there will be a great opportunity
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
to do that so but again you know there's
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
study committee My worry is if there's
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
no statement of policy there's no money
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
attached who's going to come to a
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
training to train up to do this work
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting to see what happens
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
are lot of
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
attesting yeah I I personally at the
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
study committee I you know I sat here
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
for a couple hours and I'm I went
 
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
through a study committee I I know much
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
more than I've ever uh thought I would
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
know uh and thank you for that so I I
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
agree about the study committee I don't
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's a study committee needed I
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
think we I think the general court needs
 
02:35:59.469 --> 02:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
to set policy and let the finances roll
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
wherever they're going to roll that you
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
know it's um not out of you know it's
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
not in the hands of
 
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:07.830 align:start position:0%
not in the hands of
CFL

02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
CFL
 
02:36:10.670 --> 02:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
um um
 
02:36:13.469 --> 02:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so I think there's I think
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's um you know I just want to make
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the I just want to make our stance
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
stronger um you know because I'm I feel
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
it I'm not 100% in it um you know it's
 
02:36:29.269 --> 02:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
not a Band-Aid it's substantial but not
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
as substantial as I think it could
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
be I mean what what you could consider
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
is in that like a phase in you have the
 
02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
discretionary happen you know is I think
 
02:36:43.469 --> 02:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
it couldn't occur before depending when
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's passed before January of 20 24 is
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
that correct yes and along with that you
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
could huh it's 25 oh 25 I'm sorry yeah
 
02:36:56.349 --> 02:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
okay 20 and then you could have the um
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time the change in the
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
notice to the children and the Foster
 
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights and then you
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
could have the right to counsel now and
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
and I have to say this is limited
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
remember we're only limiting the right
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
to counsel to children in placement in
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
residential facilities or who are at you
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
know very imminent risk of that
 
02:37:15.439 --> 02:37:16.550 align:start position:0%
know very imminent risk of that
situation

02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
that you could have kick in like July
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
1st of 2025 because then you're in the
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
budget year so then it could be included
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:28.230 align:start position:0%
in the
2025

02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
2025
 
02:37:31.309 --> 02:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
budget does that make sense did I get it
 
02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
right the law so if they pass the law
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah listen to yeah the next next
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
budget is uh is in 25 the next budget
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
25 but again no law no funds no right
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
they're not gonna something that is so
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
26 but we can't tie another legisl
 
02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
26 but we can't tie another legisl
that's

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
2025 the one hiccup for CA was that we
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources we don't have
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
the people that's right there one hiccup
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
right do we think that we get enough
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
people have I mean I'm all I think they
 
02:38:39.269 --> 02:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
will I think Michelle I agree with
