um uh i i think have some questions or
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've had from hearings
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
and there's probably
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
need for some uh amending language and
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the amending language and all some of
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
those bills have that written but ols
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
has been so far behind we just don't
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
have that stuff back yet
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
or i haven't even submitted it so um
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
we won't be discussing the other videos
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
that are listed for today
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
so just so you're aware of that if we
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
handle this right we may be able to get
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
out by noon
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is a challenge but perhaps that be
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
welcomed by all the stores so that with
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to get right into
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
the bills that we went through just now
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
open up with hb 608 and i'll
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
emotions

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay i move that we retain six zero
 
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.189 align:start position:0%
okay i move that we retain six zero
eight

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second for retention about hb
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
608 represent leia
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
high second and representative uh
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
seconds that motion
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
so we have the floor to retain
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
hb608 that's a funding bill
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
an early bill uh representative does you
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
have any discussions
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes um going through
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
the way the monies are and everything
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
way too many towns who are the ones who
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
most need the money
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and they're losing money and towns who
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
we need the money
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
are gaining a bunch of money and so the
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
numbers are obviously not
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
not right um trying to get amendments in
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
a timely manner with covid
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
is very difficult and we're basically
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
out of time the bill's not ready
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%

i'll agree that the need-based approach
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes again uh we had a
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
good discussion on uh hb 20 yesterday
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
by uh all committee members uh i'm
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
always been and i will continue to be an
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
advocate for
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
education choice and opportunity for
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
children and i believe the intent
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
and the direction that hb20 is going is
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
needed throughout the state i believe
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's many
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
policy considerations that have gone
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of hard work however i
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that there is still room for
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
us to further discuss
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
and clarify uh some of the issues that
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
may have been brought up yesterday
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
so with that i have passed that this
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill be retained
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh president do
 
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh president do
you

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
have any comments uh yes thank you uh mr
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i i would just like to
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
add that the bill
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
of this significance needs to be right
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
and the lines in this committee uh
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
aren't the folks to do that so
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think this is this is a good move to
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
pause reflect and
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay well can you hear me yes i can
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh first of all i i want to uh thank
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh chairman ladd for yesterday
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
we had a deep discussion
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
with which we were able to pose our
 
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.629 align:start position:0%
with which we were able to pose our
questions

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
and attempt to get some answers to some
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
very serious questions
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i would concur with uh
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative allard
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
that this is probably i believe this is
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
the most significant bill
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
in the nine years that i've been on this
 
00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:06.069 align:start position:0%
in the nine years that i've been on this
committee

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i want to uh i'm going to support
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
the retention of this bill
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
because i do think that it represents a
 
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
because i do think that it represents a
recognition

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready yet based
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
upon the concerns that we've ex
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we've uncovered yesterday
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to thank the chairman for
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
yesterday's hearing
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank him for the
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
retention of this bill
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
at this point in time this does not mean
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
that i support this bill
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
but i do support the issue of retaining
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
and uh so for further work can take
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
place on it
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr our
 
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.629 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr our
representative

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
are there further representative cornell
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
i see your hand up
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
i just i don't know if i would ever
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill but i'm glad that it's
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
being retained and i would support that
 
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.350 align:start position:0%
being retained and i would support that
because

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
i could never vote for something without
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note knowing how we'll
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
impact um the city of manchester
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
and our property taxes and what it will
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
do to our school so
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
fiscally i i would just need much more
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
information before being able to
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
to vote for this so thank you for
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
retaining it
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
thank you susan
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
it represents shaw yes um i just
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um i think that
 
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um i think that
eventually

00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
um school
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
choice is going to be
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
a part of education and i think that
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be done and it's going
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
to be done correctly
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
we have to have bipartisan support
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it has to be proven that it's going
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everyone to the taxpayers
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the parents to the children and
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
to the parents to the children and
mostly

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the children and i think that this
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
is a great move that we're going to
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
retain it and look at it and work on it
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we will have a bipartisan
 
00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we will have a bipartisan
agreement

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
at some point and i think that that is
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
the only way
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
that this can be uh processed
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh properly and it's the only way that
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
will be able to understand and to
 
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.670 align:start position:0%
will be able to understand and to
realize

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
realize
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
that something has to be done has to be
 
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.350 align:start position:0%
that something has to be done has to be
changed

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the way to do it is to do it
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
together and i appreciate that
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%

the
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
speak to the entire bill i would uh move
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we uh

second okay the second has been made by
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative shaw so
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have now 320 civics testing we have
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve the bill
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
as amended with zero two seven
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh famous joe uh very briefly i went
 
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:15.909 align:start position:0%
uh famous joe uh very briefly i went
over

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
the merits of this initiative in the
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and i'll just simply say
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh it's not a a radical
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
measure at all many other states do this
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
my sense is that the parents want it as
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
i said in committee
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think is someone who
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
favors publication public education that
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
supports public education
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think this is a nice step to help uh
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
improve confidence in public education
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh one other comment my friend dr kyle
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
radd who
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
you all know i don't know if dr ladd is
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
listening uh
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
you may have picked up that he
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
ironically was a civic student of mine
 
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.029 align:start position:0%
ironically was a civic student of mine
uh

00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
many years ago i i was not his student
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
he used my students some
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
folks get those mixed up uh and after
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill i
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
was not able to speak and dr rad who i
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
think the world of
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
um he and his family from grofton
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh he did make a comment that he was
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
very comfortable that
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
the way that civics is being taught now
 
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
the way that civics is being taught now
in

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the schools is is fine and uh
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think it is fine in some schools some
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
schools it is not
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's very uneven uh and the the
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
final comment i would simply make would
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
be uh if i would have been able to ask
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
dr ladd a question i would have
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
asked him about simply driver's licenses
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know every student
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
in school who takes driver ed has a
 
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.549 align:start position:0%
in school who takes driver ed has a
class

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the class before they
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
get their license they take a driver's
 
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
get their license they take a driver's
test

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i by the thinking of some they
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the driver's test they're
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
fine just with the classes
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
well you see my point i think that with
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
something as important as civics
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
i think we should augment the the class
 
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
i think we should augment the the class
with

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh this wonderful assessment that uh
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
that naturalized citizens need to take
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
so uh that's all i have to say
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the donate i hope uh
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
you'll support it thank you very much
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
are there any comments from
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
the second no i agree with
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative market
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative tanner uh thank you mr
 
00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:28.789 align:start position:0%
representative tanner uh thank you mr
chair

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
i uh thoroughly agree with civics
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
education and with dr ladd that it's
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
being taught in our
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
our schools my concern with this bill
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
and and i don't mind uh students taking
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
this test uh i think it probably would
 
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
this test uh i think it probably would
be

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
a good project within the civics
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
classes however it's set up in this bill
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
to be a high-stakes test
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
that they have to take it to graduate
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
those people that have a difficult time
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
those students that have a difficult
 
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
those students that have a difficult
time

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking high stakes tests uh those who
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
have trouble with
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
certain learning disabilities will we
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
cry require
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
extra time extra effort um
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
extra money in the schools to do this so
 
00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:17.029 align:start position:0%
extra money in the schools to do this so
it's

00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an unfunded mandate that um
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm very reluctant um to put this
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
burden on our public schools right now
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against this bill
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative yes i just
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to amplify what representative
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
tanner said
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
taking the test is fine but not from a
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
high-stakes standpoint and that's what
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh proposes and i'm against that
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a proposition in order for
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
somebody to graduate from
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
high school thank you thank you
 
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.710 align:start position:0%
high school thank you thank you
representative

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of points and i won't
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
reiterate although i do concur with
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative tanner and
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
milo this is a huge piece for a
 
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.390 align:start position:0%
milo this is a huge piece for a
youngster

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
youngster
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
saying the most important thing to
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
graduate basically is that you pass this
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
test with a c or a c minus at a 70.
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
um but the information that's contained
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
examination is already prescribed
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
in our rsa in the pacific curriculum
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
each school is already required to have
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
a civics curriculum each school is
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
required to have each student take the
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
service curriculum
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
before they pass this is just adding a
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
additional requirement on local
 
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.029 align:start position:0%
additional requirement on local
communities

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
on how to establish their graduation uh
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
program requirements and that that by
 
00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.070 align:start position:0%
program requirements and that that by
itself

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
is is not a good thing uh we try to stay
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
away from telling local communities
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
what to put in their curriculums how to
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
evaluate teachers what they do the whole
 
00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:01.029 align:start position:0%
evaluate teachers what they do the whole
piece

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
that's not our role so i would i would i
 
00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:04.470 align:start position:0%
that's not our role so i would i would i
would

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh concur with representative moffett i
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
think is terrific
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the intent it should be
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
be great to be
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
to augment any uh curriculum that we
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
have in civics but clearly not to be
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
passed or not pass from high school on
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
i agree with um with
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
with what um uh representatives uh
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
tanner miler and woodcock have have said
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
but uh but going further um you know i
 
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.269 align:start position:0%
but uh but going further um you know i
was

00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
i would be hopeful that uh that the
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee would consider retaining this
 
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
committee would consider retaining this
bill

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
particularly because of some information
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
we received
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
from from martha madison who's the
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.830 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
institute
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
for civic education and i would say is
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
the leading advocates for civics
 
00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.310 align:start position:0%

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the state and uh she and and
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
her organization have set up a round
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
table of it's a bipartisan nonpartisan
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
group that that involves some
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
some of their trustees including dan

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
should be used to to assess some
 
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.269 align:start position:0%
should be used to to assess some

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
sorry civics competency in new hampshire
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
and they expect to have that work
 
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
and they expect to have that work
completed

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
in october of this year and
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
and given that i think rather than
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
rushing in with
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
um with a federal naturalization
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
civics exam that is rapidly changing
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of um new questions
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
that are introduced and
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
and things that we um that we defer
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
to this um this bipartisan nonpartisan
 
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
to this um this bipartisan nonpartisan
roundtable

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
roundtable
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of recommendation and and i
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
think uh you know i think retention is
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
probably the
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
better uh uh choice with um
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
with this bill right now thank you
 
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.310 align:start position:0%
with this bill right now thank you
representative

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman first i'd like
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
civics in a lot of schools is not being
 
00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
civics in a lot of schools is not being
taught

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
taught
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
you see the word civics and teach other
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.430 align:start position:0%
you see the word civics and teach other
things

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
so without being taught next taking you
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
can see surveys on the street asking
 
00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
can see surveys on the street asking
people

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
one of the three four three levels of
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
government nobody knows
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
who's the vice president nobody knows so
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's a big problem
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
with civics being taught also
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
interesting one of the
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
when we heard it said that even though
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
she was against it
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
when she taught civics she used this
 
00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:56.149 align:start position:0%
when she taught civics she used this
test

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of her course and the
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
test after the course
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
and but her argument was there wasn't
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
any time
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum to do it again when
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
she taught it the worst time
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
the also uh
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah oh that's it thank you thank you
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
very much represent woodcock do you have
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
i apologize chairman admiral thank you
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%

okay thank you uh further further
 
00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:28.950 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh further further
comments

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i am in favor of
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
as you know by looking at me i don't
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
have children in school
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
but i have many parents contact me
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
and parents are
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
don't like it because their children are
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
not being taught
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
what they need to be taught in schools
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying this is in
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
every school the ones that are doing a
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
good job in civics
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's great but the ones that at we
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
need to bring them up to standard and
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
personally i think this bill will do it
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and i back it
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
cornell i guess if it's supposed to be
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
being taught in the schools um which it
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
is it's one of the competencies and if
 
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's not being taught
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
isn't that the department of education
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to oversee that and make
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
sure that what's
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to be taught is being taught
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
and i know they're very busy and they
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to do that
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
but i don't think passing a bill saying
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
they must pass this test where teachers
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
might just take teach to the test
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
instead of students
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
learning civics they're going to
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
memorize the answers to a test
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
which they will forget in a month
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
because that's what we do when we have
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
to memorize something
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't relate to anything else
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not taught it's memorizing
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think making them take the
 
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think making them take the
test

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
i i think there should be more civics
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
that kids take you know
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
every day i realize things that i don't
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
know as an adult who
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
reads newspapers and and keeps up with
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
things and every day it's like
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that and so i i think
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
there's plenty that
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
students could be taught but i don't
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
think making
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
the this test part of their high school
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement will accomplish
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.350 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement will accomplish
that

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know but i think they should be the
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
schools should be responsible for
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
for teaching civics and someone should
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
be checking on that
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you very much uh rep
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
sound luna
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again mr chair um i
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
agree with everything
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative cornell just said um but
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
the reason i put my hand up
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh was was because i'm very concerned
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
particularly after what um
 
00:32:58.399 --> 00:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
particularly after what um
representative

00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
baum and andrews said that that civics
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
um is not being taught in uh in a lot of
 
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
um is not being taught in uh in a lot of
schools

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
and the effective date on um on
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 320 is 60 days after passage
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm really not sure what the
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm really not sure what the
schools

00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
and the seniors are going to be
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
expected to do or or what people expect
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
um even this during this school year
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
if um uh if this if this passes uh
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
and and and is going to apply to
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
students in those districts where civics
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
education is currently not being taught
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um i i'd like to
 
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um i i'd like to

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
i did a little experimentation
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
if your ten-year-old passive that uh
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
tells me that uh
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not a high-stakes
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
test in the sense that it's uh
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
terribly demanding information is out
 
00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.510 align:start position:0%
terribly demanding information is out
there

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
eighth graders some given
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the school district
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
i do want to respond

students the bill specifically
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
allows districts to administer the
 
00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
allows districts to administer the
assessment

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
to students with ieps in accordance with
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
the recommendations locally of the
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
district uh
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
and also uh representative luna would
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
mention martha madsen who
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
is as he stated is uh at the forefront
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
of civics education
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
here a very very long conversation with
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
her two days ago and she was
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh we had a wonderful conversation about
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
all aspects of civics education which
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
she supports i support
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we both agreed that assessments
 
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
and uh we both agreed that assessments
are

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
important i don't know that i would say
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
she specifically
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
endorsed the spell i don't think i won't
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
i would go that far except to say
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
that we had a wonderful conversation she
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that assessment is very
 
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that assessment is very
important

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the big picture thank you
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yeah i haven't had a
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
chime in yet uh several years back uh
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro myself introduced
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
legislation which has become law
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
and identifies various themes that i've
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
been placed into
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
law topics regarding civics
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
and we also recognize that instruction
 
00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
and we also recognize that instruction
curriculum

00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
is a responsibility of the local school
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
district so it's not up to doe to come
 
00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
district so it's not up to doe to come
down

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
and give that assessment in fact when we
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the statewide assessment
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
several years back we looked at
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
mathematics and language and writing and
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
reading the other areas of assessment
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
are those
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
that are of the local community
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i think this is not a responsibility
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
of do
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
doe to ensure that this is being done
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's a responsibility a local school
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
district to ensure
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
if it hasn't been done then it belongs
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
down there
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
however we have before identified these
 
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
however we have before identified these
themes

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
themes
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
and topics i see absolutely no problem
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
with our administering this assessment
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
especially if we know
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
a 10 year old is able to pass this and
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
do it i think every every person ought
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to pass it
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and to understand that the
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
this test identifies various principles
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
and beliefs that this country
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
yes go go ahead um on
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
just for my own notification on the
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
amendment i didn't see the
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh effective date although i do see it
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
on the primary bill of 60 days
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to clarification
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh from the protocol maybe
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt or you could
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
explain it to me
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
if a high school student has already
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
taken a civilized course
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
in their uh process right now that would
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
say a junior
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
or a senior and pass that course
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean we have to go back and
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
set up a separate
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh program to have them take that test
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
even though they've already passed
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
civics it's question a and question b
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
is uh is that effective date uh
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
would it i understand 60 days from
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
passage at least on the primary bill
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
does that mean that that would be
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
effective this year pastoral
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's two questions to respond to your
 
00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:19.589 align:start position:0%
that's two questions to respond to your
question

00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative it says 60 days
 
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative it says 60 days
following

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill being you know approved or
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
um upon passage and we're looking that
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
we're just concluding the month of
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
february so it's march april may
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
left in this school year very little of
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
june and so this bill has to float
 
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.870 align:start position:0%
june and so this bill has to float
through

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
our body on the floor go to the senate
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
same thing there
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
i doubt very seriously if it's going to
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
be signed into law
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
prior to june 30 of this year and that's
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
the end of this fiscal year
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the term for those students that are
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
seniors this year so i don't think it's
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to be relative to
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
to a senior having to pass this to
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
graduate this year
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that could you answer
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
what was your part two if i've already
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
if i've already taken the civics course
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
on high school and passed it
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
where something would there be a whole
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
special testing for this
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative you want to answer that
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
part uh
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question uh as
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative vlad said
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
should this measure move forward the
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
60-day time thing would push it into the
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
next school year
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
and so uh current students who satisfied
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
local civics
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
requirements by taking a class would be
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
off would be all set to graduate this
 
00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:39.910 align:start position:0%
off would be all set to graduate this
year

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
if this measure goes into effect then
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the districts would need to adapt to it
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh in 21 22.
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
so to follow up they have to if i've
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
already taken a class i'm
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
a sophomore or junior right now i pass
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
civics with an a
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm done civics so i the school system
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
will have to set up in the future
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
some special testing about the process
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
well there was the the intent of this
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
is to have this assessment in place for
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh 2022
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh is a graduation requirement not not
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
not this year it's so bad
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that thank you thank you mr
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay um representative thank you mr
 
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
okay um representative thank you mr
chair

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
one point of clarification the amendment
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
only replaces child
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph one so the effective date
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
stays in place
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
so with this you know june going to may
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
if we're not definitely not going to be
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
april 30th so this would uh definitely
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
apply to the following school year
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
and if a student is a senior and already
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
had civics in high school i would assume
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
that just because you finish your civics
 
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.069 align:start position:0%
that just because you finish your civics
class

00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
and you can now forget all this stuff i
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
think it'd be a great idea that they
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
be administered the civics desk before
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
they before they graduate
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't take a whole lot of time
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'd probably sit down and take it for 30
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
seconds or
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
30 minutes 30 minutes
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative mullen
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair so i
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
could not agree with you more that i
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a local control
 
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.829 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a local control
issue

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing that prevents a
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
school system
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
from utilizing this exam as
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
part of their curriculum i i think i'm
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
correct in saying that
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
um but but i am somewhat
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
dismayed at our indicating that there
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
are schools all over the state
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
that are not teaching civics education
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
to the standard that they're supposed to
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
reflecting back on the idea that
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
the department of education shouldn't
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
have authority over those schools to be
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
go in and work with the school to make
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they're meeting the standards
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
in fact set by the doe so
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
that concerns me and uh
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward from this point whether
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's the exam on civics education or not
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to be taking a look at
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
the claims that are made
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
against school systems that they are are
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
not doing something that they're
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
and where the jurisdiction lies
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
on corrective action for those school
 
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
on corrective action for those school
systems

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further comments
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent thank you mr chair
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
should the should the bill be amended to
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
like something like
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
7122 something like that based upon this
 
00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:44.470 align:start position:0%
7122 something like that based upon this
conversation

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't believe so i think that you
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't think it's going to be
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh going in effect during this fiscal
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
year and so the following fiscal year
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be signed a law on the front side
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
of that and there's ample opportunity
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
for these schools to
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
get up and get going
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
so so excuse me so you believe that the
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
60 day after
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
is going to take place subsequent to
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
this school year
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
well it at the time frame for this to
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
to go through the senate and then be
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's highly unlikely that it's
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know be done before the at least the
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption though okay that's
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the concern of
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
that was just my concern the timeliness
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
of this and when it would take place
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
very much further further comments
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative thanks mr chair um
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
and and thanks for your time on on this
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
um do
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
what at what point do um
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
do school districts develop curriculum
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and assessments
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
and even if this does roll into the the
 
00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
and even if this does roll into the the
fy

00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
fy
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
22 school year
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
do school districts have time to make
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
changes to curriculum and assessments
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do that particularly when when
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know students graduating that year
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
may be taking
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
civics well they might be taking civics
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
this year i think as representative
 
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.349 align:start position:0%
this year i think as representative

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
said so i think the effective date is is
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
potentially a very
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
important element of this if we want to
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%

funding to the to the municipalities
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
rather than first to the school
 
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
rather than first to the school
districts

00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
um in our discussions with the
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
department of education this will be you
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
know there should be no more than a half
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
day difference in time frame
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
and this will give clarity to the
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities in order to make sure
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what is heading to
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
these school districts there are already
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
other monies that go through the
 
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
other monies that go through the
municipalities

00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that this is a good bill
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
that for good clarification and good
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
transparency thank you
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative do
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
you have any comments yeah just to
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you mr uh
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
do your the town or the municipality's
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
tax collector flex
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
all the other taxes going to
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
town and the school district so
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is a way for the tax collector to
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
know how much money
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
there is and how much money to then
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
distribute to the school
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
on a timely manner so yeah this
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh both cases is not a problem but in
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
some cases it seems to be a problem
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
so let's move forward with it
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
open to discussion from the committee at
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just want to
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
reiterate what uh the superintendent for
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
kearsarge said
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um with any kind of regional district
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
with multiple towns
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
that means that the paperwork and the
 
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
that means that the paperwork and the
transfer

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
is not just really easy it's done times
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
seven towns in the
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the kearsarge district um that's
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's 14
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
more times and in the past we have had
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
issues and i know other regional
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
districts have
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
issues with towns who have not
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
paid their portion of the school tax
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner for one reason or
 
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.790 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner for one reason or
another

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
and i think this just exacerbates that
 
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.549 align:start position:0%
and i think this just exacerbates that
problem

00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
um i i see the the
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
process working well right now i really
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a kind of a bill looking
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a problem
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
and uh it's going to create more
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and more paperwork so uh i'm
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent luna thank you thank
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um the um we did hear quite a bit
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
of testimony
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh on this but uh but but nothing
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
in the in the affirmative from from
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
from anybody involved in the in the
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
actual transaction
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh on either side of the transaction
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
either from the school district side or
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
from the municipal association side
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
we also didn't hear any evidence at all
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
that there was any credible problem
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
and any evidence from the department of
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
education that there's any credible
 
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
education that there's any credible
problem

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
to be solved by house bill 110 but we
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly did hear
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
of um of problems that um
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
or just additional effort that's uh
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
born on the part of the school district
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of this so
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i you know i i i would not support
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh this bill thank you further further
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
comments represent woodcock
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%

and the hearing
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things one of the things is
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
not true what i just heard now
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
all money doesn't necessarily go to the
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
tax collector
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
federal grants go to the go to the doe
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and does some of the school department
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
so they all don't go there this is this
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
is a duplication
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
for many systems to do it twice to get
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
it out there so it really has
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
it has no usefulness it doesn't do
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
anything except made one more
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%

email this morning with this amendment
 
00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:21.430 align:start position:0%
email this morning with this amendment
that

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
might have gotten caught in affiliate 4
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
hcs was
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
mailing them out so i was not sure so i
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
sent it out
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
basically the amendment um is based on
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
discussions with the department of
 
00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:39.270 align:start position:0%
discussions with the department of
education

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh who originally requested this bill uh
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
problems with a just a handful that's
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
that of
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
schools or charter schools not providing
 
00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:52.870 align:start position:0%
schools or charter schools not providing
information

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
as required and this amendment
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
clarifies really a
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
miss misunderstanding
 
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
phrasing in the original bill
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
and the intention was not to require
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
private schools to submit reports
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
or tax for teacher salary information
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
that applies really just to public and
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools so
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph 1a
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
was added and
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
the teacher salary report was stricken
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
from 1 and 2 clarifies that it
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
is just the public and charter schools
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
that are to submit the
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
average teachers salary support so that
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um all right is there a
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
is this coming from a request from the
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
department that they want this
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
information or
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative just to try to
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
genesis for the amendment or are you
 
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.670 align:start position:0%
genesis for the amendment or are you
talking

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
like the whole bill yes
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
i have represented cardinality thank you
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes this uh really uh originated
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
with uh discussions with the department
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh they contacted me
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
um about problems that they have had
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that there was recently a
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.270 align:start position:0%
charter school
that

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
turned in their charter based on
 
00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.789 align:start position:0%
turned in their charter based on
problems

00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
found there and that is i believe one of
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
the instances where
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
they have been unable to get information
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
as required by the department from that
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
some teeth were needed in the statutes
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
to require the public and chartered
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
and in some cases non-public schools to
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
supply the information to the department
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
because in some cases that is also
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
federally required
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
information that has to be gathered by
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
the state agency
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
so they felt it was important to give
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
the department some clout in terms of

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
promote her representative lad
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
you just said jen okay
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um caitlin can you hear us
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'll take just a second
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
morning good morning um just just so you
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
know i was
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
in another meeting and i heard my name
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i came back over this so i missed
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
some of the preliminary conversation
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so um but i'm here um and i assume
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're still talking about hb442
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that is correct right um so the
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
department actually did
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
reach out to representative cordelli um
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the year
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
actually um the history of this bill is
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
um we had originally worked with senator
 
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
um we had originally worked with senator
khan

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
khan
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
last year to get this bill sponsored um
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then unfortunately with
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything that happened with kovan 19
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the delay in the legislative session
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
last year the bill
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
was tabled and we did not have a
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
resolution that the department needed
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so we then reached out to
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli over the summer
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and asked if he would sponsor this
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
legislation on behalf of the department
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill currently so our goal with
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
this bill was never to expand any
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
um it was just to give the department a
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of teeth for some of the
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
that are already in law that we have
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
that that same
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
kind of teeth that we have for district
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
public schools to expand those same
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
teeth to either
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or charter schools so
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit different in the
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
sense that for
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
a right now if a school district
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
fails to provide a regular district
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
public school district fails to
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
provide reporting the department of
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
education does have the authority to
 
01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.309 align:start position:0%
education does have the authority to
withhold

01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
withhold
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
various funding payments either federal
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
and or state
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
until those reporting requirements are
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
but we do not have that same authority
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
over charter schools
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
and or non-public schools with
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
we do not provide them any funding so we
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the authority to
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
hold any payments but we could ask the
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
um to potentially
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
revoke their approval if they fail to
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
report more than two years in a row
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
some of the reporting requirements that
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are general
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
statistic information meaning enrollment
 
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.309 align:start position:0%
statistic information meaning enrollment
information

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
or health and safety this emergency
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
operation plans which are already
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.390 align:start position:0%
operation plans which are already
required

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
to be submitted in state law and then
 
01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
to be submitted in state law and then
for

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools we asked for
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
either the author the ability to ask the
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
state board of education to revoke the
 
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.309 align:start position:0%
state board of education to revoke the
charter

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
charter
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
or to hold payments in the case that we
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
are making payments
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
so for example we have a charter school
 
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.109 align:start position:0%
so for example we have a charter school
that

01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
is operating and has not had an audit
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's required
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
already in state law um we
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
we now if this legislation passes we'll
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
have the authority to
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
not pay them any more state funding
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
until the audit has
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
been um done so
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the department
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
i just i i even though we've uh voted on
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
this representative vlad
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
caitlyn i'm assuming that this uh the
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
amendment that we've already
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
just passed strengthens the uh original
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill that was
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh purported so yeah so the amendment um
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.549 align:start position:0%
uh purported so yeah so the amendment um
was

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was the original language was a
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so it just it
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
the um the non-public school folks had
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
kind of reached out and said
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
they their interpretation was it was
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
requiring them to submit other reports
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
that they were not required to
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
submit um so the amendment clarified
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
that no
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
we were just we're going to require them
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
to submit everything that's currently
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
in law um and there's just a little bit
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
of teeth for the department to do that
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that the amendment was just kind of
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
pulling the non-public peace out and
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
just clarifying that further
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%

thank you just to add a few comments
 
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you just to add a few comments
here

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh for those and i think reps and milo
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you may have been a part of this and
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
aware of it but
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
remember when we had the 30 million
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
dollars for the infrastructure
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
monies for the safety security and
 
01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
monies for the safety security and
connectivity

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
connectivity
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
in schools and a director plumber at
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
that time for homeland security and we
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
were looking at this
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
and it was brought to our attention that
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
a number of school districts
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
had not gotten their emergency
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
management plans in correct but we put
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
it to them and said you want to get the
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
money from this pot
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to get these done
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
bam those things came in to us
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
like greased lightning and we got all
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
that reporting done
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's incumbent on us to try and
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
support the department here
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that reporting is
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
timely especially regarding someone's
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
federal grant money
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
so they could be holding up uh the whole
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
application or they could be holding up
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
the new revenues coming in so
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think there is definitely some merit
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know anymore but are there any
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're not hearing any uh are seeing any
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
