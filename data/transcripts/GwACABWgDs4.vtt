00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
title exemptions for vehicles over 20
 
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
years it came out of committee 170 one
 
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
on the consent
 
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
calendar uh and the funds that are
 
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
budget does anybody have anything they'
 
00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
two go ahead represent thank you Mr
 
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
chairman how what is the dollar amount
 
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
is it it's 24,000 that I see here yeah
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
but it comes out of their current budget
 
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
you anybody else yes obviously the
 
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
original Bill set a date 2000 then
 
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're going forward and it becomes
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
you know now it's 24 you know it's it's
 
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
24 years ago so 20 years makes more
 
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
sense than just saying before the year
 
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.670 align:start position:0%
sense than just saying before the year
2000

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
2000
 
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
so seems to me it's pretty obvious that
 
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
that language need to change and that's
 
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
done yeah nobody else as much as they
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion okay like to move
 
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
to recomend to the okay do all motion
 
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
seconded do we want a show of hands that
 
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
would that be sufficient would we like
 
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the
 
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
role show a hands all those in
 
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 align:start position:0%
favor okay it's
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.910 align:start position:0%
 
10:55

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
10:55
 
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
okay that will give me plenty of time to
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:20:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
ments and putting up unauthorized
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
Moorings uh administrative law requires
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
specific authorization for a type of
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
fee and they don't currently have a fee
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
for for replacement decals the the
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
original decals are covered in statute
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
and this um allows them to charge for
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
replacement it is not the same statute
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
basic boat decals which is the subject
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
of the bill but we felt it
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
was it was close enough to use this bill
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
as a place to put it we Jael car
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
approved the rule with the
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation that
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety worked with various
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
legislators to get legislative
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
clarification so if you approve if you
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
decide to accept this amendment it will
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
back up the rule if you reject this
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
amendment the department of safety will
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
probably have to revise their rule
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
because they don't have authority to uh
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
charge a replacement fee I'll be glad to
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
rulemaking part if you have questions
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
about the decals we have someone from
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety who who
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
understands what's going
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
on any questions
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
yes there's a couple of things that that
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
come to mind when I come to section two
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
exemption from
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
registration and then they put that
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
section in there then they don't list
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
anybody that's
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
law well it I'm not I'm not familiar
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
with the current with the existing law
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
on decals if canoes and paddle boards
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
have to have a registration that could
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
be what the exemptions
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
are that's in the existing law so it's
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
not shown would that's the only reason I
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
can think of they'd have the heading but
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh not any
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
text thank
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions clear's
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay any more
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
clarification uh I know the department
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
is here if we'd like to hear from them
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
but if not um I just wanted to mention
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
that um as chairwoman Maguire mentioned
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
that both the Senate members and the
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
House of Representative members
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly agreed that this would be a
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
good move for the for the fix and we
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%

all

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%

you we have plenty of time okay so I I
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
expected Captain dunlavy to be here this
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
morning um and actually he was over in
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%

this bill in prefacing that we'd like to
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
add a Germaine amendment to it for the
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
Jael car fix and um they they mentioned
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
that their work has been completed early
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the first committee before the Jael
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
car issue was raised so it seems like
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
the policy issue had been thoroughly
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
vetted before this gel car matter had
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
so I mean if that gives you any sense of
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
how how the committee how this bill
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
ended up here under these circumstances
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and to add to that a little it's the
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
bill really is about policy I don't
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
think we need to talk about the policy
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
it passed the house on a vice Voice vote
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
there was not a lot of a controversy and
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
the financial impact is basically nil
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
because it will cost 48 th but those
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
will be recouped as you know as part of
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
the fees that they're issuing so you
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
know I I don't feel that a lot of uh you
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
know argument discussion is needed
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
here um if I may Mr chairman I do have
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunley here um I think he might
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
be better suited to answer some
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
questions about the primary Bill all
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was in the
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
restroom Mr chairman honorable members
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee Tim Dunley I am uh
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
representing you uh the department of
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
safety Marine Patrol unit before you
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
this morning uh in regards to this bill
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
before you today this uh has a bit of
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
History I won't get into it too much
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
other than to say just because you're on
 
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
camera if you would like to sit down it
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
you there was a bit of History here
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
um the Marine Patrol receives about a
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
million and a half dollars a year from
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government through the Coast
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
Guard recreational boating safety
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
Grant as part of the receipt of those
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
funds they do an audit to make sure that
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
our program is complying with federal
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
law it was determined that during our
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
boat registration
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
process that we were including fees that
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
went to uh Public Access search and
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
rescue a dredge fund overseen by the
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
Port Authority in in in Portsmouth and
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
um funds that go to the Department of
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services for the fight
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
against aquatic invasive
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
species federal law prohibits the state
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
from collecting any funds other than
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
specific boat registration fees at the
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
time of that financial
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
transaction New Hampshire is one of
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
numerous states that were doing so and
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
as a result we got our letter from the
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard saying we need to remedy
 
00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:17.350 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard saying we need to remedy
this

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
process as a result um this went to
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
study committee uh and during study um
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
um chair uh representative kraton
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill before you today to
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
create a second decal
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
program that requires a person who is
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
registering their boat to also purchase
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
decal that is capturing those fees that
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
we can no longer charge uh with the
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
registration it's basically creating two
 
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
registration it's basically creating two
Financial

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
transactions and that's all the Coast
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
Guard is looking for is the creation of
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for a person to just pay
 
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.350 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for a person to just pay
registration

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
monies and not anything
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
else however uh this bill is designed to
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
make sure ensure that the person is
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
still paying those
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
fees if that's clear as mud please let
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
me know go ahead question just to make
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure I understood it correctly the
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to allow you to
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
operate the same way you've done before
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
but with a proper legislative backing
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
and with a minor headache of now having
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
to do two decals and two transactions
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
instead of one like we used to be
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
precisely and the only difference in
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
fees that the individual will pay from
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
five years ago or if this bill passes
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
when it's implemented is an additional
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
$3 to cover the cost of that second
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
decal that is all that is before you as
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
far as uh a change in any fees that the
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer the boat owner will see
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's not changing who has to register
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
it's not changing the the amount of the
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
fees that have been collected for our
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
instate Partners all these years it's
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
just separating um the collection of
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
those fees that are currently in
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law this is a nosy
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
question how long have you been doing
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
how long has this process taken just out
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
of curiosity uh we've been doing this
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
for well I started in the late 80s with
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol and it's been that way
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
the fees have changed no I'm saying this
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
this pulling it apart so you got a new
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
decal when did the Coast Guard get after
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
you about that uh we're now uh well they
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
went to they went to study first so
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
we're we're in our fourth year okay
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's F I was just curious yeah yeah
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
any question yes oh this is just sort of
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
a more of a comment as a question
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it since other states are
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
involved dare I say wouldn't it have
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
been easier if the Coast Guard had
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
changed their rule
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
no I'm told as a federal agency that is
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
a a tremendously
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
long uh uh process I will say in closing
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
that because we are not the only ones
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
and uh our partner agencies as well as
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the department of safety here in state
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
are working with Senator Shaheen's
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
office at the federal level with other
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
states to remedy the current language in
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
federal statute that being said we know
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
what that process may or may not look
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
like in time so we've got two parallel
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
courses um we're encouraged by what
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
we're seeing at the federal level uh
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
however representative kraton did not
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
want to back off our efforts here for
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
fear that if the feds take a little
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
longer it it could jeopardize uh our
 
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.509 align:start position:0%
longer it it could jeopardize uh our
partners

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
funding representative wer I'm still
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
curious about the bill we have says
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
exemption from registration but it
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't list anybody is that because
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
we're only seeing an incomplete part of
 
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.789 align:start position:0%
we're only seeing an incomplete part of
that

00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh no you're you're seeing it all I
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
think the exemption from registration
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
was just from certain fees and it's
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
because there's a second decal being
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
added they're not technically
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
registration fees any longer so I think
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
that's that perhaps is the reason for
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
the language you don't have to register
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
canoes and paddle boards right that is
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
correct and none of that is changing all
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
exemptions from registration that exist
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
today will continue to exist thank you
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
just to again make sure I understand it
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
correctly the language the only change
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
we see is in the heading of the chapter
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
because the body is left unchanged and
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
therefore doesn't need to be listed we
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
just list what we change and we are just
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
changing the title to include the new
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
decal references and all that so okay
 
00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:49.669 align:start position:0%
decal references and all that so okay
thank

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
you and and you'll recoup the this has a
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
a a fiscal note of
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
$48,000 and that's buy the initial
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
inventory and stuff that's exactly right
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair did did are you also
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
mentioning that or taking
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
um um are you're also noting I should
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
say that the fiscal note was amended
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
that thought because the initial bill if
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
it goes into effect would only be a half
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
year um so it would be 24,000 in the
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
first year and then 48 in the following
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
years thereafter right that's that's
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
what I've got but it comes out of the
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
fund yeah yeah so it's really to us it's
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
fun okay thank you sir thank you very
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
much appreciate it okay we have a motion
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
for the bill as amended all those in
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
favor raise your
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
hand okay
 
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.629 align:start position:0%
hand okay
unanimous

00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay we now have until 11:20 whoa we're
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty close here I'll be darn
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
right on here while there's money in the
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the actual bill is
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
authorization just the authorization
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
looking for the Department of Education
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
will have to come back to to the fiscal
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee actually to fund
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
execution uh and and we know we know
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
that the education trust fund has
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
sufficient money so that's a nice
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
approach do anybody have anything you
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
like to comment on the bill itself
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Heath thank you Mr
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
chair I just would like to hear about
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
from Amy about how she sees this rolling
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely good morning for the record
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy Clark and I work for the
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in the school
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
facilities Bureau and I believe my
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
program would be responsible for rolling
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
this out uh if we had funds to do so um
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the current Law requires us
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
to do this facility assessment study
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is just a um if you can see above
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
um on that Amendment there's already um
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
language that requires us to do so this
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
is just adding additional clarification
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
language I I think that uh
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative lad may maybe thought was
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
necessary so uh but we still don't have
 
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
funds for performing this study that's
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
been required by um the agency for a
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
couple couple of years now one or two
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.630 align:start position:0%
couple couple of years now one or two
years

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
this uh Mickey do you know do you know
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
what why this is showing in 2025 $75
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
revenue is that on the fiscal note yeah
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
um I think the if I is your fiscal note
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
dated the 21st of
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
February no so you should have one dated
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
the 21st of February for the bill as
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
amended how it how it passed the house
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.109 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
what's the number of the of that house
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill 1570 if you don't have it I have
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:23.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay so this one
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that 75 million
 
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
so that 75 million
disappeared

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
right not that this changed a lot
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yes represent Heath so just a
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
question um I remember
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
Years Gone by in school approval um
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
school districts were supposed to do
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
some kind of an assessment of their
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
buildings there as part of the school
 
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.190 align:start position:0%
buildings there as part of the school
approval

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
process um many years ago probably it's
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
changed since because staffing has been
 
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.390 align:start position:0%
changed since because staffing has been
reduced

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
um so this would replace and authorize
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
the department to do an assessment
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
and to hire the necessary people to do
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
it would there be a um a sequence of of
 
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.549 align:start position:0%
it would there be a um a sequence of of
years

00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
or so I'm not familiar with the prior
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
assessment I'm not familiar that the
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
state has at one time the state did do
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
um somewhat of a self assessment for
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
facilities um and uh we have that in
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
paper form I think it was done maybe in
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the '90s uh and schools check checked
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
off whether they had a boiler and HVAC
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
system what type of roof they had it was
 
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
more like a survey uh per se uh and but
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
since that time there's been no fac this
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide facility assessment and
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
again the requirement is already in law
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
this bill just adds some clarification
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
to that but there still is no funding to
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
complete that assess assessment so if
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
the state wants us to be able to
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
complete that we will somehow need to
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
get funding to do
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.430 align:start position:0%
get funding to do
so

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
I I think the funding source was the
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund and and my
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
thought process on this is it's looking
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
for somebody
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
to interview Consultants or
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
subcontractors and come up with a number
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then go to the fiscal committee and
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
say here's the number I that that that's
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
what we've been have dialogue about I
 
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.630 align:start position:0%
what we've been have dialogue about I
don't

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
know does that make sense um I'm not
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
sure that does but uh um I have not been
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
privy to that okay uh information but um
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
we have look I could be making this all
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
up I I'm not sure what our next step
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
would be uh um if we had uh funding to
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
perform the assessment we certainly
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
would uh put out a RFP for that and
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
before we found out the exact dollar
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
amount right um we have um in the
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
ballpark we have about 15 cents a square
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
foot we know that it'll approximately
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
cost lost 15 cents to 20 20 cents a
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
square foot we have about 33 million we
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
actually don't know how many square feet
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
we have because we don't have an
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
assessment but we estimate we have about
 
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
33 million square feet that that's about
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
$5 million for the assessment on
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
potentially the low end question not as
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
a qu not as much of a question as a
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
suggestion since you know in order to
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
perform this before the new budget year
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
which would be a long way down the road
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
the funding has to be approved by the
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal commit ittee maybe you know it
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be best if you uh contacted the
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask them exactly
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
what is the process they'd like to see
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
before you come in front of them to
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
request funds and I'm sure they'll be
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you with proper
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
guidance yes yes and the commissioner
 
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
may have um started that process as well
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay question does this bill give you
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
the authority is is that what this is
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
looking for the authority to go to
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal no that well whatever the
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
language is they're that they're adding
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
they already have the ability to do
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
that rep I those questions are good for
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative lad I I'm not sure you
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
intend no language is needed to
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
authorize that they can go to the fiscal
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
committee for you know any need for
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
additional funding that was not part of
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the budget process that's authorized by
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
law and part of their mandate so adding
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
new language would be you know we got
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman right here he could tell us
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.349 align:start position:0%
the chairman right here he could tell us
exactly

00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
oh yes so just to remind everyone fiscal
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to just
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate money to any agency who
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
requests it there are statutory
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
authorizations for that so this this
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
program I don't believe
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think if you wanted to make it very
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
clear for the Department of Education
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
had the authority to access education
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
trust funds through fiscal I would add
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
it to this bill so currently under
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
current law they've got the ability to
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal to access funds if they are
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
short to administer School building Aid
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
payments it could be argued that's not
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
what this is so I think if you wanted to
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
have your position be that this is uh
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
the policy is that they could come for a
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
warrant through approved by fiscal to do
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
this project or this uh assessment I
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
think it might be best to add it to this
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
bill so sound the
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
probably the thing to do is prepare an
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so that we if it's the if it's
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
the division's intent to allow the
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
department to go to fiscal to seek funds
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
to do this assessment you could add it
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
to this RSA and sense we're really not
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
approving anything I mean yeah I mean
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
like I said there there is an RSA 19839
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
an ability for doe to come to fisal if
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
they to administer state aid programs
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
like to disperse funds I I'm not sure
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily completing this
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
assessment but at least that way you'd
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
be covered the department would be
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
covered and have a clear just by a show
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
a hands how many people would like to
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment propos preped okay so
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
can you get get us an amendment I don't
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
know when we're going to meet again
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
because we got elections next Tuesday
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we have we don't
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
14 Okay so we've got a little bit of
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
time all right yeah yeah thank you Mr
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
chair um one or two questions depending
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
on the answer to the first um how long
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
how effective what's the the the shelf
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
life of doing an assessment of each
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
building in terms of how long how
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
valuable is that over time and the other
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
thing is if it says an additional 250 to
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
500,000 each year to the aafter T date
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
so this would be an ongoing project as
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
well and so it's not a matter of the
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
shelf life of the of the project it
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
becomes self-correcting as you you're
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
nodding so that's a um it's actually a
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
very great point because there are
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper options where you can do uh one
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
time and be done it's that data just
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
gets outdated so fast so for it to be
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
any use for us for the state to for
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
planning purposes it really does have to
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
have a ongoing maintenance cost of um
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
you know I Envision a system where
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
schools are able to update annually the
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
systems that they've added any kind of
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
capital projects that they've added if
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
they've replaced roofs or anything like
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
that that they can log in and update
 
00:52:48.839 --> 00:52:49.630 align:start position:0%
that that they can log in and update
that

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
information yes and well they have staff
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
to do that I mean some of the schools
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
are very small
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
um some are you know they're very some
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
are very large um do they have the staff
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
to maintain updating this or if it's a
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
very large school perhaps the Department
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
of Education would have to help out a
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
little bit um it just seems like you
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
have a wide variety of abilities and um
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
attributes of different schools uh I
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
believe it's not a huge undertaking for
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
the facility manager every district has
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
for most for the most part um every
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
district has a facility manager and they
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
are this is these are their projects um
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
so I don't foresee that they that it
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
would be a a large burden to update that
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
year so the and also that information is
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
part of the CIP for the town correct
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's actually critical
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
information that the school needs to
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
talk to their school boards and
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
everything about the status of their
 
00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.150 align:start position:0%
everything about the status of their
school

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.829 align:start position:0%
school
right

00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes do you need any other authority to
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
conduct this
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
um just um in the amendment the
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
authority to go to fiscal but also the
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
authority to conduct this first review
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then annual updates do you want
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
something in this bill that would say
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
what should look
 
00:54:14.119 --> 00:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
what should look
like

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
I the more I guess that would be up to
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
you all from my take the more specific
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
driven from those of us that are not
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
fully um sure what the proposals will be
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like um putting out those rfps
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
seeing what comes back what is actually
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
useful information would be good to have
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
that flexibility in there um but if
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
there's something specific that the
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
state wants to see in there um so to
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
back up there's there's something called
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
the facility condition index it's it's a
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
standard um number that it's calculated
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of different ways by different
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
organizations but it's a standard
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
um term in the industry and that's
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
really what we would be looking for is
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
that facility condition index as well as
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
that is for any type of building right
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
you could do a facility condition index
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
of this building it would take in a
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
bunch of factors and you'd get this
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
number which tells folks in the
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
industry how well the building is doing
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
and the life of the equipment and what's
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to break down next um there's also
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
what I think is really important is the
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
educational suitability um of a building
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
as well um the example would be you can
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
have a bu bowling alley that has a
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
excellent facility condition index
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it suitable for an
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
educational facility so when we when
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
other states look at this they're
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
usually looking at the condition of the
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
facility and the suitability um of
 
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.029 align:start position:0%
facility and the suitability um of
educational

00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
purposes and we don't have anything like
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
that right now we we do not thank
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
you yes uh while we're on the the
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
subject it's not on this bill but uh
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
construct building construction or
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid um
 
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.630 align:start position:0%
building Aid um
applications

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
so I've noticed that school district
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
gives away buildings and then asks us to
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
to build new building shouldn't they be
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
maximize the value of of the buildings
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
they're discontinuing and sell them so
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
that money can be used for the new
 
00:56:24.599 --> 00:56:27.109 align:start position:0%
that money can be used for the new
building

00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar of that happening um
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
our building Aid has been very limited
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
over the past um decade U plus um I'm
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that being a
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
substantial issue with the um buildings
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
themselves when they turn them over
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
every town is different um if they were
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
to sell the building and make a profit
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
that actually um does get reporting on a
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
building aid application and the amount
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
of state aid is reduced by that amount
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
if they're rolling it over into a
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
municipal they their local taxpayers
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
already then um I know that they yeah
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
the local taxpayers supposedly own the
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
building but if they give it away the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
Boys and Girls
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
Club that's not a local tax organization
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's not so it would seem to be wrong if
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
you're just giving away this building
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you might have got a couple million
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
for then you come to West and ask for
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
more Millions right so the building Aid
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
has a requirement in the law that the
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
building be used for at least 20 years
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes or they have to
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
pay the building Aid back um so but
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
beyond that I mean if um beyond that the
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
law just requires that to be 20 years
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
and another instance I heard of where
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
they they were selling a building and
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
the only offer was a charart of school
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
which we have in law they're supposed to
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
be the first ones they refused to sell
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
them they should then be not eligible
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
for any building AG
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh I think there's a new law that
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
requires uh charter schools to have
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
first right of refusal for buildings and
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps that was prior to that law but
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's now a law that requires after
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
that law yeah well that's a legal issue
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that school then for not complying
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
with the law but I think they should be
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
exempt they should they should not get
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
any building
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
Aid if they're not obeying the law I
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
think that should be also in the
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
criteria how you select that's a fair
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
statement but it isn't right
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have a law specific to
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools violating the law that
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
requires them first right of refusal to
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
you Micky do you have enough for
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I guess the one thing I'd want
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
to clarify is would you want that
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
Authority for the Department to go to
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal to be in perpetuity or just to
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
bridge you until the next budget so just
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
to be for fiscal 25 only and then they
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
would just budget this contract moving
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
forward Li yeah yeah limited so it'll be
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
a budget item in the future I I think
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
they'd like it the other
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
item question and the whole point of
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to fiscal committee is that we are
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
asking them to do this off budget you
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
know in in the middle of a budget rather
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
than during a budget otherwise we would
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
not even have this discussion so you
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
know the safe choice is to just
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
authorize them on a temporary basis and
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
then we'll catch it in the next budget
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
cycle I mean works for
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
me any other comments well we have we
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
have to yes oh I just had a question if
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
the committee has a strong sense of
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should include the two
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
measurements that Mrs M Clark was just
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
condition or the educational
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
suitability is that something we should
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
try to include or is that too much
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
policy I don't I'm not smart enough to
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
say yes and I'm not smart enough to say
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
so if I may suggest you know thinking
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
about it I would be hesitant to
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe to the department exactly how
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
they got to do their job circumstances
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
change statutes are a pain in that wish
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
to update if a better index comes along
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
I would expect that Department to go use
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
it instead of so I I would rather not be
 
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.589 align:start position:0%
it instead of so I I would rather not be
that

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptive okay so we have I would say
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
fortunate or unfortunately we have a
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor made second it but
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
table if well I think we'll just suspend
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
the motion we'll consider this our next
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
work session Mr chair it it has been
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
practice of the division before to vote
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
knowing I'm drafting an amendment I'll
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
draft it based on your wishes that way
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have another work
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
session on this if we've done that
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
before well we're going to have to have
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
another work session on a couple other
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
ones anyway okay if yes if it's an easy
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
enough Amendment sounds like it might be
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps it'd be ready by the afternoon
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we could come back to this no our
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
head so I can withdraw my motion okay
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
and so we'll just consider this at our
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
next work session we be have due notice
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much we and
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll see you
 
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll see you
again

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
okay we have five minutes until our
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.630 align:start position:0%
 
morning

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
so this bill coming up also has a
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note just so everyone has
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
that uh if you didn't have it before
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
that packet I just passed around has all
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
the revised fiscal notes so you may have
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
some duplicates now but at least you
 
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.109 align:start position:0%
some duplicates now but at least you
have

01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
have
everything

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:06:34.589 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
11:45 I'll open the work session on uh
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%

Cuts anybody like to make any comments
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%

01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
good morning almost afternoon I'm
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander from gtown um
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
so to put a little bit of perspective on
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is a product of the
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work of the special committee
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
on housing um this bill would place a
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable timeline on Das to sign or
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
not Das do to sign driveway permits um
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
as they're related to residential
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
Housing Development so um representative
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
mccon is here to kind of give the story
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
of after I dropped the bill off in
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
public works hands um what they ended up
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
doing with it I know they condensed it
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
um amended it a little bit to just
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
relate to residential uses but um this
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill mainly is a product of the need for
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
um a faster more efficient way to get
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
permit signed um this was something that
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
we heard in the special committee and as
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
you see this bipartisan co-sponsor list
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
um it puts a reasonable timeline on dot
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
um the amount of permits they in they
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
indicated this effects is such a small
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
amount that I think this could help move
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
the ball in the right direction if we um
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
pass this bill so I I'm going to let
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
represent makoni speak to how it was
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
amended I think the fiscal Noe is a
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
little bit lower now than it was before
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm going to kind of refer let
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
him um speak more to that um
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
additionally I have an amendment to this
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's so minor it's a technical change um
 
01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.189 align:start position:0%
it's so minor it's a technical change um
basically

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
the um there was an incorrect paragraph
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned um by OS um this just
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
references the right paragraph So This
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
is a technical error OS couldn't make
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
the change because it's already passed
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
the house unanimously on consent so um
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
again this is really important bill I
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
think it'll help streamline the housing
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
process and approval so I hope that
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
you'll support it no matter what the
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note looks like thank
 
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.789 align:start position:0%
fiscal note looks like thank
you

01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
additional

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
comments good morning Mr chairman Steve
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
members of
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
Finance um when this when this bill
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
first came to Public Works in
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
highways uh it had a larger scope uh TR
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
after um the mention of uh
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander uh the special
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
committee on housing that was set up by
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker and we' met for months
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
nearly a year uh to discuss what were
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
detriment to Bringing housing forward
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
and we looked at all the Departments
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
department environmental services do uh
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
land planning and so forth and an
 
01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.950 align:start position:0%
land planning and so forth and an
overriding

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
overriding
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
um mention kept coming from
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
developers uh was that it was taking
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
such a long time to get a driveway
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
permit uh from the department and um I
 
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.189 align:start position:0%
permit uh from the department and um I
fully

01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
fully
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand um you know being coming from
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
a rural area some of our specifications
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh roads and things are a lighter Duty I
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
fully understand that some of these
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
projects are from down south where it's
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
more congested but I offer to you that I
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
have Conway and other areas in my group
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
that are are complicated also after
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the department uh talk about how
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
much energy this was going to take to
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
make a wholesale change to their
 
01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.510 align:start position:0%
make a wholesale change to their
permitting

01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
process um we had paired this project
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
down and said we will take one piece at
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
a time the the housing uh was a is a
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
high priority for those on this
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee and the speaker and so we said
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
well let's just look at driveway permits
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
for this very specific person uh for
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
this purpose which is including
 
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
this purpose which is including
multifamily

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
multifamily
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
development um proposed residential land
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
including multifam development we went
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
we went on to ask the department so it
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time we understand that
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
how much of percentage of time does this
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
take from your department of all the all
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the permitting that you need to do and
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly the department
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
had said that this was at most 1% of the
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
volume for for um for their
 
01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:28.750 align:start position:0%
volume for for um for their
department

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
so I I fully understood that you know we
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
could pair this down and this sounds
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
like a simple place to start and the
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
original proposal when it came forward
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
the department thought it was going to
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
take at least seven more Personnel to
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
handle that the the whole scope uh but I
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
was unaware till I walked in here today
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and it my mistake um that the department
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
is still calling for four Personnel to
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
handle something that is less than 1% of
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
of their um of their
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
workload and I fully understand that it
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
takes more but the governor and the
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
speaker and many people uh in this
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislature believe that moving forward
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
with housing projects sooner than later
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
is is a good a good thing to do there
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
was a second change in this propos
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
proposal because there was a concern
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we weren't giving the planning
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
boards enough time so lines 28 to 30 I
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
have I've not had a chance to look
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
through representative Alexander's
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I'm sure it's warranted uh
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
saying that the planning board that
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to the timelines in
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph two and uh in their review I'm
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing shall not exceed 65 days so
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
I from my time here in the
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
house many times physical notes are
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
generated by the
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
department and I love this department
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong I've been in public
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
works and highways for nine terms I came
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
in in 2002 I have nothing but the utmost
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
respect but I I feel it's a
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
priority and
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
um if if language needed to be amended
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we're to say a once a complete
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
application was presented to do that
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
that time still remained at 30 days I
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
think that would go to appeasing uh the
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
department somewhat and would be a more
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable request so with that I'm
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions just thank you Mr for
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
testifying and for taking questions the
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
last thing you said is kind of a you
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
know bit of a concern to me because I
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
understand that the department is in a
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
tough position if they receive an
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
incomplete application and the timeline
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
starts that's fair but would that make
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
it possible for the Department to keep
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
resetting the timeline by just
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
continuing to ask for new and du
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
documents when they may not necessarily
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
be there I'm I'm trying to balance it
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
between making it too harsh or too LAX I
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
I I thank I thank you representative for
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
the question I and there is that
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
possibility but if if I
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
can move off that Center for a moment if
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
I could Mr chairman Department of
 
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
I could Mr chairman Department of
Environmental

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
Services um had in subsurface had a
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
regulation back in the 80s that said the
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
department uh shall approve uh an
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
application brought forward in 30 days
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
and what the department was doing
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
routinely then was doing exactly what
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
the representative suggested they would
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
wait till the 29th day and then they
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
would issue something's missing
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
something needs to be
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
corrected that was that was that brought
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
more legislative legislation forward and
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
um but what's happened in the department
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
environmental services is they've moved
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
that timeline now to 24 to 48 hours they
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
weren't told to do it in that time frame
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
but they've become that efficient
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
because holding up families from having
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
a septic system or a failed septic
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
system and and I offer it and if the
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
department if I if the uh finances does
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
not agree I would withdraw that
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion I have I have faith enough in
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
the department that uh I believe it's a
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
good faith judgment we're pushing them
 
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
to 30 days we know we know that's a
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
number but we don't aspire to do
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
something until we're given a
 
01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
something until we're given a
deadline

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
question we've had experience in our
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
town recently that they waited for a
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
driveway permit and then word came down
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to put in a traffic
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
light and of course you would have to
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
pay for all the expenses and the lane
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
widening and so on and so forth and and
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
of course they were not able to reply to
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
that right away so it was like a year to
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
go back and having refiguring on
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
everything and and you know that that
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing there ought to be some
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
warning if you're going to be coming out
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
from the traffic light instead of wait
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
till the last minute say nope no permit
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
till you put in a traffic light it seems
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable thank
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative question
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um can you point me to the
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
difference between the amendment and the
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
small got it thank thank
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.310 align:start position:0%
small got it thank thank
you

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
you made a You made a comment I'm on the
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
planning board and have been for a long
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
time and the the operative word there
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
was an accepted complete
 
01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
was an accepted complete
plan

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
so the 65 days is the same amount of
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
time the planning board has in statute
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
now okay once once they have agree they
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a complete plan the question is can
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
applicant can a developer come with an
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
incomplete plan to make a request a
 
01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.470 align:start position:0%
incomplete plan to make a request a
driveway

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
request I um I the Departments here
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
could probably answer that better I'm
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I would assume that that might be a
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
possibility other
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
you someone from the Department would
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.990 align:start position:0%
you someone from the Department would
like

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
right good morning chairman uh committee
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
members my name is Mike citus I'm the
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
director of operations at nire do um
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to that question yes you
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
can file and routinely we do find uh
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
incomplete applications um normally the
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
basic application
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh is a form that's filled out uh but
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
then you also need to provide Deeds to
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
show how that particular parcel uh was
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
in 1971 so that you can see if you're
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for um your own driveway or not
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
as well as you need to provide some kind
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
of documentation we prefer a sketch uh
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
of site distance you need to have at
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
least the minimum sight distance one of
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
the things that goes in with that sight
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
distance piece also that a lot of people
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
misses the driveway should be at the
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
safest location you may have 400 feet
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
but there may be a safer location for
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
that um so that's that's one of the the
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
places we get hung up on um that's for a
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
basic single family driveway which is
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
also the basis for uh if you go up to
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
anything larger uh a major generator
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
when you go to a major generator there's
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
another section our policy and you come
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
up with additional material usually it's
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
trip generation you know basically you
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
want to know what kind of volume of
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
traffic are you going to be generating
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
or expecting to generate from that and
 
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
where are they going um that basic you
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
know those two pieces kind of help you
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
decide is there going to be an impact
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
and are you going to need
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
mitigation and that's that's kind of the
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
the big pieces that we we work
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
towards um you know I guess what we try
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
to set and there's uh in our process now
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
you basically file an application if
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
it's a major generator which is usually
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
anything over six six uh residential
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
unit subdivision or commercial you would
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
go to a scoping meeting um which would
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
have people invited from our traffic
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau Highway design uh might be
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
environmental uh we us try to invite the
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
town representatives and other
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but they that basically
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
sets the information that's going to be
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
required ired to support that
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
application once that information comes
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
in The Next Step would be to review the
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
traffic study because basically that's
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
going to tell you how much traffic you
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
might need to
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate once you figure out once they
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
approve the traffic study you take a
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
look at mitigation it maybe in in many
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
cases you don't need any but if there is
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation you really need to Define
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
what that is right at the beginning like
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
you said so you don't get halfway
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
through it find out oh there's more you
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
need to do you know we want to set right
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
at the 30% or right at the beginning
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
what is the mitigation required and then
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
you go through that final design process
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
which the final design process can be
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
lengthy you know our opinion is if
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to do work in the state
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
RightWay it should be to the same
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
criteria that we hold any consultant or
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
any engineer that does work in our right
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
away which when you get to different an
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
engineering firm some that are Highway
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know have Highway design
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
capabilities they understand that some
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
that do more let's say in the uh design
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
phase or or offsite you know site work
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have quite the same
 
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
constraints that a highway design does
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
so um I don't know if that helps y
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
question now here we're going to make a
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
decision on money so we've had a fairly
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
mild winter there should be some Surplus
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund is it possible this
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
Surplus in the highway fund could be
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
used to fund this until the next
 
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.590 align:start position:0%
used to fund this until the next
winter

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
winter
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
um that that's a finance question I
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
guess I can't I'm not sure about that i'
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
have to talk with our finance folks and
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
see you know using that money seem to
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to be able to do
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
that rather than you know whole new
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
propriation the fiscal note actually
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
says Highway fund yeah
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
your question is there enough funds in
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
the highway well I'm assuming the usual
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
seven or eight million in a in a mild
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
winter in Surplus well I don't know if
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
we'll quite get that far but yes we will
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
have our projection right now is
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
assuming we don't have anything out of
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
the ordinary which I still expect at
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
least one more storm we will have a
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
surplus to it yeah thank you
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair in the
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it says depending upon the
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
type of permit applied for the deadline
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
shall be 30 or 45 days for which failure
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
to act by the deadline will result in
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
the issuance of a permit by
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
default that sounds very dangerous to me
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's one we'd like to avoid I mean
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
basically we we try to avoid denials
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
right off the bat um but I'm
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's kind of what we
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
think it might result in more denials
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
versus working with the contractors to
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
or the developers to to kind of work out
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
some of the issues um again what we like
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
to say is we're not the only force in
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
the application it really depends um a
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
lot on the engineers and the applicants
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
that are submitting information the more
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
complete the information is the more
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
accurate the you know the quicker the
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
review times are going to be just just a
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
followup um with regard to your
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
statement about um whether or not the
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
driveway would be in the best loc the
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
safest location who determines that um
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know we give a lot of latitude to
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
our district engineers and our field
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
staff um they base that a lot on site
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
distance um but they also base it a lot
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
on what they're getting reported from
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
the field Crews you know if there's a
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
location that seems to I don't know have
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
an issue that they they want avoid they
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
might try to to move it away um so it's
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's a lot to do with our our district
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
office you provides that and one more
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being so patient
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
with me um in terms of the four
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
positions do you believe that with those
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
four positions New Hampshire is in a
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
crisis in terms of housing we all every
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
Community M Manchester we we all are
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
short of of housing units with the four
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
additional position i s do you believe
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
that you could comply with the timeline
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
presented um it's going to be very
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
difficult I I don't know for
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
residentials it will be very difficult
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
we have talked about how to do it um you
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
know there are some some ways there are
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
certain thresholds we think we could
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at that we won't need
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
mitigation that if the material comes in
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
complete we may be able to take a look
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
at uh complying with that within 30 days
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
um at least getting through and and you
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
know we have basically the the six
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
sections or six criteria if you can get
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
through and provide a pretty good
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
traffic impact study to begin with and
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
we can show no mitigation the last P
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
well you don't have to go through
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation or design so the last pie
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
really is making sure that you have or
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
certify you have all your
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
permits uh basically making sure if you
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
have any impacts any place that you uh
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
for utilities that you have the
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
utilities relocated in there and any
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
easements um that's at that point we
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
could probably either issue the permit
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
or you know the conditions in the permit
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
so in those cases we think we could
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
probably do it part of the reasons why
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
we still want are looking for four um
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
additional positions as well as within
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
that uh funding source is funding our uh
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
we we use a lot of Consultants now
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
historically we've always used uh cons
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
traffic staff from our traffic Bureau
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
and Highway designers from our project
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
development staff um those are not no
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
longer really use uh we can't really
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
schedule them they've got so many other
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
priorities now um that we've had to go
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
and start using more Consultants um so
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
we've you know spend about
 
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
135,000 on getting Consultants to do
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
design review for us and we need to
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
continue that in order to you know look
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
at again when you have a a you know a
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
couple hundred major traffic plans or
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
traffic permits a year we still need
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
that consultant assistance as well as
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
replace those people historically that
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
we had from from Highway design some
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
from traffic and then somebody to
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
basically get out in the field and do
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the field work those are the people that
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
we still need in there if we're going to
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
expedite and again it's I we're looking
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
at somewhere between currently about 60
 
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.229 align:start position:0%
at somewhere between currently about 60
65

01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
65
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh residentials I can foresee if you
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
pass this that number is going to go up
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to expedite those
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be jumping those permits
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
over people that are already in the
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
queue for reviews so in order to you
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
know we can't just look at those
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
specific residentials to jump we need to
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody else gets in the
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
review so again that's why we've left
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that consistent is we're trying to take
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
measures to move everything forward
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
measures to move everything forward
represent

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
just to revisit an issue I discussed a
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
bit earlier you mentioned you know
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
complete application and again I
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
understand the need to have that
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
information but at the beginning when
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
you describe the application
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
process I understood you to say that for
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
a major generator you need a scope
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
meeting which will set the information
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
needed to support application that leads
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
me to believe that if I'm a major
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
generator I cannot just have the
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
documentation ahead of time cuz I
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through the scope meeting
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
so now I got to wait for the scope
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
meeting to happen then I know what I
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
need then I got to produce that and then
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
my clock would start if we decided on
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
the complete application this seems to
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
be amazingly excruciatingly slow is it
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
possible in any way for the Department
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
to make it clear exactly what is the
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate documentation based on type
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
of project ahead of time so hopefully
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know reduce the need for scope
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
meetings or is that something that's
 
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
meetings or is that something that's
just

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
essential to how your process works uh
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good question uh the
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
the type of material is all laid out in
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
the um driveway design manual or the our
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
policy and you know most people if
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're doing a major you've got an
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
engineering firm and they know generally
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's being provided what we generally
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
see now is the appli application comes
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
in and they'll submit you know some
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
additional documentation like you know a
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
a traffic impact study and
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
that based on that basic guidance is
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
what they used to start with the scoping
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
study is say okay this is you're going
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
in the right direction but here's
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
additional material one of the things
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
we've talked about um just kind of ball
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
U you know spitballing in there is um do
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
we move for these residential ones do we
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
move the meeting ahead of the time to
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
lay out what the requirement is that's
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
something similar to what they do with
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
one of the wetlands permits is 30 to 90
 
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
days ahead of submission they have a
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and lay out what's required so
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
we have talked about doing something
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
similar um and again that would be
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
something these people that you know the
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
new staff would be
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
handling thank you just as a quick
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
followup so I I don't want to
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstand what you said but I think
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
what you said is
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
basically we couldn't really tell them
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what is needed without going
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
through the scope meeting before or
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
after somehow you have to figure out
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
what what they're design what they're
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
planning to do in order for us to come
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
up and give you what we need to have for
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
it so if you've if you've got let's say
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
um a Dunkin Donuts very large generator
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
but a small site you know that might
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
have a different requirement then if
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
you've got a large site let's say a
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
large box that uh that it's going to
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
generate a bunch of traffic so so what
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
we try to do uh before the scoping
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
meeting is get an idea what is it you're
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
planning what what size development so
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
we have a better idea of what to ask for
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
so it's that it's there is always a go
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know back and forth that's just part
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the design I appreciate it I'm uh
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
just going to probably bother you
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
offline because I'm still I'm an
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
engineer I in my world stuff can be
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
defined if you document it properly
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
enough ahead of time I I understand more
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
about the complexities but I don't want
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
to take the committee's time for that so
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
please don't leave without me giving you
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
a business card thank you
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions yeah thank you Mr chair you
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
have alluded to this but I would think
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
in more um plain language if you could
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
talk to me um is I know there is
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
situations you regarding here but I'm
 
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
also thinking crosswalks where you have
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
your guidelines and this is where it
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be and it's totally unusable
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
for the person who's asking for this to
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
be done so can you speak a little bit of
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
how you work back and forth pushing back
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
and forth with the person who is
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
requesting this to match your guidelines
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
when if they followed your guidelines it
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
it would be of no use to the person
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
who's making the request does that make
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
do you understand I guess what I'm
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
asking I think so and normally you know
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
um that's again where we engage our
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
traffic Bureau they have SE guidelines
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
they'll usually go out in the field and
 
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
talk with the people that are requesting
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
it um we do have guidelines and a lot of
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
those are kind of laid out from the
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
mutcd or other guidance documents but
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know that is where we we rely on our
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
traffic bureau's um experience and and
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
consistency and again those would stay
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
the same you know that we would I don't
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to say that we're going to take our
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
traffic Bureau and Highway design
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
completely out of the equation but we
 
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
can't rely on them in a timely fashion
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
because they have primary jobs that are
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
you know we just can't pull them off to
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
to work on our projects so we need
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
somebody that we can fully be scheduling
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves to do this
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
work okay
 
01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman so I'm
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the docket here on this bill
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
and it this this bill came out of
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee 18 to zer1 on consent and then
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
was passed on the floor in a Voice vote
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
so somebody's looking at this and saying
 
01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
the department can do all this but at
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
the same time it
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
says a failure to act within the
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
deadline will issuance of a permit by
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
default can't have that we would prefer
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
not to what
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
so at this point I it looks you have
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
you're asking for four positions it's is
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
that going to is that going to resolve
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
all those issues is it going to be
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
enough to it's I mean 30 days is a short
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
time I think we put in there to be
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
honest with you we we have a lot of
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
vacancies that's part of what's giving
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
us our problem we're requesting these
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
positions to be dedicated straight to
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
what we do right do we think we can fill
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
them I I would like to say yes but I
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
don't think so so again we are going to
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
have to what we try to do is explain
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
what we need to do this you know to try
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
to make a great faith effort in in
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
accommodating this without doing it we
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
will still try I mean we'll we'll work
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
on it I will say the first thing is if
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
we have to prioritize residential there
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
are projects that are in the queue that
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
are going to get delayed I mean that's
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
just goes because we got the same people
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
working on it um so some of the bigger
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
major projects that are already don't
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
like the timeline are going to get
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
lengthened out um and we will try to
 
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
work with folks but again 30 days is
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
going to be it's going to be tough I
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
won't say not all of them can't be again
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
the big cons the big idea is does it
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
warrant is it going to need mitigation
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
once it needs mitigation it pretty much
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be a longer process um but
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
we can work and try to come up with ways
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that we can better Define that early on
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's a good portion that
 
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.109 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's a good portion that
might

01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
work thank you I just um I wonder what
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
the discussion was in committee that
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
allowed this to come through and said
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
you got to issue by default
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah again that doesn't seem right to me
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
again we at the department and we've got
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
a possibly a slanted view but we look at
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
this as you know U the permit is really
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
our way to kind of protect the uh the
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
The public's investment in the state
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
transportation system and you know we
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
think that although we will admit our
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
system does get a bit cumbersome and
 
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
it's gets laborious but we like to look
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
at it that we're trying to
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that if if you're
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
developing you know we're putting things
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it as safe and have
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
least impact on Mobility that we can and
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that takes some time to
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
look at thank
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
you question it's more of a statement I
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
think uh and I plead guilty to doing the
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
same thing we kind of Dove deep into the
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
WIS on policy here and again I'm guilty
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
of the same at the end of the day this
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
is uh you know Finance too and this
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
policy has already been voted on by the
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
house in rather U impressive manner so
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh I think that you know we are at a
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
point where I I kind of had an idea of
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
what the department can ask for I
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
understand the complexities of using of
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
even finding those positions but I also
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
trust the department to be able to uh
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know find ways to achieve the
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
mission that the legislation is the
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature is asking them to do so I'm
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
happy to stop of
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
myself sorry just one final question in
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
terms of liability for the state does
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
this have an impact do you believe on
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
projects that have had permits provided
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
that haven't had the due diligence that
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
probably you would like to see that's
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
that's a concern of ours I think we
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
would review them and I'd like to say
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that you know any that we had that kind
 
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
of concern we would deny you
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
know I've only heard two numbers that
 
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
really stuck with me one was uh one this
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
is 1% of your
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
workload uh and and the the request is
 
01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.910 align:start position:0%
workload uh and and the the request is
for

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
$600,000 a year for four people for 1%
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
of your workload is that well again it's
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying to say is it's
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
not just just those four people would
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
not not be just looking at the
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
residentials these are four that it's
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably closer to uh I don't know four
 
01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
to 500 that they would be looking at
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
they'd be working on all you know
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's we the majority of our our
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
permits come in as you know single
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
family residential those we try to
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
handle and we we can handle those pretty
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
quickly they do require some some
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
handholding sometimes because residents
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
aren't used to going through the deed
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
process um they're not used to some of
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
the things but it's the major projects
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
you know we have a lot more of those uh
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
commercial projects that those these
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
four additional Pro uh positions would
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
also be working on
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
them basically because moving the
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
residential ones ahead are going to
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
delay them so and we would agree that
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
these four are needed so that we can
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
move those projects faster you know so
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
this is this this isn't just for these
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
those the the residentials this is in
 
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
order to get the whole process moving
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
which includes the
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
residentials question U more of a
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
comment Mr chair I guess uh it's worth
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's worth reflecting as a committee um
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we are not the policy committee we
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
are the finan finance committee so you
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
know to keep that perspective in mind
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
but also to remember that solving the
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is going to be more than
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
a silver bullet right so each step that
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
we can take in many departments across
 
01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:31.159 align:start position:0%
the state to help address the situation
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
although maybe incremental um will be an
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
important piece of of moving Us in the
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
direction of solving those problems so
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know for me the calculus is does the
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
fund have the ability to support this
 
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.669 align:start position:0%
fund have the ability to support this
additional

01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
change and if it does I feel like we
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
should be you know supportive of it
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
given that the policy committee has
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
already spoken firmly um so I I just
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to redirect our thought process
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
well I agree and according to this it
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
comments anybody want to make a anybody
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
want okay thank you Mr chair I move that
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.270 align:start position:0%
 
pass

01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
motion oh we need to amend we need to
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
accept the amendment first yes for about
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment amendment number
 
01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.510 align:start position:0%
the amendment amendment number
0945

01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
H seconded if you need one
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
okay so the the uh uh vote is on the
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
adopting the amendment that has a change
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
in it but I I'm kind of at a loss of
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
ah okay thank you that's all right this
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
isn't all those in favor of the
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
amendment okay
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
unanimous now we have a motion made in
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
second it
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
for but to pass as amended as
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
amended is that seconded second okay
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
amended I think it's unanimous no no no
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%

02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
1288 relative to certain due process
 
02:21:58.270 --> 02:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
rights for
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
students would anybody like to comment
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
means um so I um I'm not sure that I
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot more to say than what I said
 
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know when we when this was debated
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
on the floor I think that um there are a
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
number of states and I think it's
 
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
increasing that have um that have these
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
kind of bills um the the language in the
 
02:22:31.469 --> 02:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
one that's you know that is in this in
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um that I believe it is
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
drawn mostly from AR I drew it mostly
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
from Arizona there's Arizona Florida
 
02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:46.150 align:start position:0%
from Arizona there's Arizona Florida
Arkansas

02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
Arkansas
 
02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:47.710 align:start position:0%
Arkansas
and

02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember what there there
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
was another state but I I looked at all
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
of them I maybe Oklahoma I think that um
 
02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
Arizon is one was the one that seemed to
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
be to me to be uh the best you know the
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
best sort of language and so I drew it
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's not completely word for word from
 
02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
Arizona but it's it's close and it's
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
basically designed to ensure that um
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
there are due process
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
protections um in for for students and
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
faculty members student
 
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and I think it's
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I it's there are 10
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
basically 10 sort of rights that I think
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard would it be hard to argue why
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
any of those rights are not important to
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
have before somebody faces um adverse
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
action and I think I think one of the
 
02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
things I think is really important to
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
understand is that partic let's take
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
particularly with students but I suppose
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
it can be faculty members too
 
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
even though this is you know a um a a a
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
an education proceeding as opposed to
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
like a criminal trial or even a civil
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuit the consequences of that can be
 
02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
really significant I mean somebody you
 
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
know particularly take take the example
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
of sex sexual assault somebody is
 
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
somebody is accused of having sexually
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted somebody and it let's assume
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to a criminal case or it
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to a a civil case but there's
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
been been a f in made um that's that
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
that that happened I mean I could you
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
know that could have very very
 
02:24:27.269 --> 02:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
significant uh consequences to
 
02:24:29.389 --> 02:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's life later on and so I think
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we ought to we ought to want we
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
ought to all have an interest in making
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
sure that um those decisions are
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
reliable and you know I take the I the
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
sexual assault thing is the is is
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
probably the epitome of where this can
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
be a problem because you know having
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
been a judge and having sat on a lot of
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
those ca cases where they were criminal
 
02:24:59.230 --> 02:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
cases it's almost always he said versus
 
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
she said that's just reality the reality
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the situation and sometime the state
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
the prosecution will try to dress it up
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit with sort of collateral
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
Witnesses but these kind of thing I mean
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you just think about these kind of
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
things don't happen in public they
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
happen in private and so it's very often
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
almost always
 
02:25:20.269 --> 02:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
he said she said and you know just
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
speaking personally most of the ones I
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
heard when when she said it was mostly
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
true I mean that would be if you know if
 
02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
I were the FactFinder and most of the
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
time if the jury was a FactFinder it
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
probably was most of the time true but
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's not always true and it I think it's
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh we as a society have a really strong
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
interest in making sure that you know we
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't that that we don't end up
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
tarnishing an innocent person um as I as
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
I think I said on the floor you know we
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's always been our the the history of
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
Western democracy that it's better to
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
have 10 guilty people escape punishment
 
02:26:04.269 --> 02:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
than have one innocent person be uh be
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
wrong wrongfully charged or wrongfully
 
02:26:09.309 --> 02:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
convicted and I think that that that
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
same process has to be true in the
 
02:26:13.389 --> 02:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
school setting so that's why I think
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:26:23.269 --> 02:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah protective
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
orders uh that uh I had some uh
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
calls on this bill and that's one of the
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
things they were worried about was
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
protective orders and you know a lot of
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
girls that that uh that happens to you
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
know they leave I think they they come
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
up with with a statistic of like
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
39% that uh that they left how how do
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
you how would you how would that work in
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
this within this
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill the the protective the protective
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
the protective order and and enforcing
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
it I mean it's because most of these
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
kids come in you know from other states
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
or other other towns and uh that that
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
was one of the
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions you know they had concerns I'm
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure I know what you mean
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
by in other words if you mean by
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
protective order that how do we how does
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
the how does the person that's that's
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
the accuser how does the accuser be you
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
know protected from harassment or
 
02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
something like that I mean
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
that's I no it's the other it'd be the
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
other way
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
around in other words the the girl goes
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's say she's from Massachusetts right
 
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
and he tries to follow her even though
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's a protective order on
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
oh sure well that I mean that's not
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
something I don't I don't that's not
 
02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
something that in the school kind that's
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
not something that this bill addresses I
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
mean that would be the school doesn't
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
have any authority to issue a protective
 
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
order that would be something you'd have
 
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
to go to court for and so the the uh the
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
court could certainly issue a protective
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
order I mean I they might you know could
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
a school say don't go to this dormatory
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
or don't sure I think they probably
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
could do something like that but in
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a of a real protective order
 
02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
that you know somebody could be punished
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
for violating go by by you know having
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
to be found in contempt of court you'd
 
02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that well sure yeah I don't that's not
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
how I understood I don't think that's
 
02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
what he was saying suppose you have um a
 
02:28:43.230 --> 02:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
faculty member who has been a who has
 
02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
been accused of sexual assault right and
 
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
the police have issued issued a
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
restraining order that he can't go near
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
her but it's in reading this it sounds
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
like the school could have her come in
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
and face her accuser and the issue is
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
how do you protect if she has a
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
protective order from her from her um
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
the person who assaulted her this says
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
well you know you just come on in we
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
will just ignore the protective order I
 
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
think that's what he was getting yeah
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
well we you know I mean
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
that it would be hard to imagine that
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
the protective order would apply to that
 
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
I mean for example if a protective if a
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
protective order is issued in let's say
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
your example a protective order is
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
issued that protective order doesn't
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
mean that if the that if the if there's
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
a criminal charge or even a civil charge
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
against the accused the person accused
 
02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
that the person who is who is the
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
accuser can say I don't have to go to
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
court because I have a protective order
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
and I'd I'd be in his presence think I'm
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
not sure that we're still on the same
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
page I think the the problem is
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
that let's just make it you know this
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
way right you have to stay away from me
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm accusing you of hurting me
 
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
right and so the police say you stay
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
away from me from here it sounds like
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
you you're being brought up in front of
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
the university to address this issue
 
02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
right um and I have to come in and
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
testify I am not being protected from
 
02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
you I am being in the same room with you
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't make me feel
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable what but well but the
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
problem with that is that's that's no
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
different than it is would be in a civil
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding or Court proceeding you if
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
you're the victim and you get a
 
02:30:23.349 --> 02:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
protective order so that the Vic so that
 
02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
the the accused has to stay away from
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
you that doesn't mean that when the case
 
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
comes to trial you don't have to go to
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
court you of course you have to go to
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
court and you have to you have to face
 
02:30:37.309 --> 02:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
your accuser and that's I mean that's
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's like the very basis of our
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
justice system we don't allow we don't
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
have a system that says you can and kind
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
of make a claim against somebody and
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
then you never have to uh you never have
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:59.710 --> 02:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
person just can't you do that remotely
 
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
now can you do it that's possible I
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
suppose that's possible I don't think
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
there would be I don't know that I mean
 
02:31:08.190 --> 02:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
in in a criminal trial I don't think you
 
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
could do that I think that would be but
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
in some in a proceeding like this I
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
think that probably would be true I
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
think the the you know the a school
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
could say okay look we you know we're
 
02:31:21.389 --> 02:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
going to um we're going to have a
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and the the accused is going to
 
02:31:27.070 --> 02:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
be able to to uh confront the accuser
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
but it can be done remotely and I would
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
think that that would be that that would
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
make sense because the hearing officer
 
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
still going to be able to look at the
 
02:31:35.710 --> 02:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
person and you know that kind of thing
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that probably would make
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
sense so thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking the questions I just want
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify my understanding because it's
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
my first term do I understand correctly
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
that the protective order would protect
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
you from contact in your normal life but
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
when you do go to hearings where you
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
know there may be cross questioning
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
right you expect those people to be
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
there and it's just something that we
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
need to require in order to get the
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
correct outcomes from those cases right
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
right no I mean that's exactly you don't
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the the I have
 
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
never understood I've never had anyone
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
even claim that a protective order means
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
that if you're the if you're the victim
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
or you're the person that accuses
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
someone of doing something wrong that
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
the protective order protects you from
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
not having to go to court and I think
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
the same thing would apply here it
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't protect you from not having to
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
go to the hearing although I do agree
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
that you know and depending on the case
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
the it might very well make sense for
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
the hearings officer to say we're going
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
to do this remotely that that might very
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
well makes sense assuming you had video
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
and all
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh what
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
precipitated this why uh I got I got I
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
got quite a few calls on this like I
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
said sure and they feel comfortable with
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now in other words
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
the universities right and the community
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
colleges yeah yeah you know I'm I'm I'm
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
sure I and I don't mean to say this fous
 
02:33:11.269 --> 02:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
I and I I I have the utmost respect for
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
both the university system and the
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
community colleges and I'm sure that
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
they do feel that they're doing it cor
 
02:33:21.309 --> 02:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
you know and everything's fine what I
 
02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider is this you
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
know these these kinds of due process
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
cases due process issues have been going
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
on I mean at least since the 1970s or
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe the maybe the mid-60s
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
even in which in which nor courts have
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
said no no you can't you can't do this
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the way you're doing it you've got to
 
02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
have more fairness more process and the
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
argument that has always been made and I
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
mean you can read it in the New
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court constitutions
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
you can read it in the United States
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court constition the argument
 
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
that has always been made by those who
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to have more procedural
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
fairness is everything's fine no problem
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're handling this just fine it's all
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
informal if you if you if you require
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
more process it's going to get more
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
confrontational that is always the
 
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
argument and I believe it's from from
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
their perspective it's made in good
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
faith but the but the problem is it's if
 
02:34:31.269 --> 02:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
you afford greater due process
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
protection that doesn't that that's a
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
good thing that means that you have you
 
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
can have more confidence in the fairness
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the outcome I mean given you know the
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the 10 things that you're talking
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
about uh notice of the charges Advanced
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure of witnesses and evidence the
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence the privilege
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
against self-incrimination the right to
 
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
cross-examine um the right to have an
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
advocate all all of those
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
things it you know does it does it mean
 
02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
that there'll be more more
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
process sure will it take a little
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
longer sure um but I mean that's that's
 
02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
what our system is designed to do to
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we arrive at the right
 
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
result not the convenient
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Mr chair I'm just
 
02:35:31.469 --> 02:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
looking for a little bit of data point
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
to Anchor this discussion I'm wondering
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know the expense that I'm looking at
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it's quite Hefty so I'm
 
02:35:42.510 --> 02:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
wondering you know what in the past
 
02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
say 5 10 academic years how many of
 
02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
say 5 10 academic years how many of
these

02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
adverse um action cases like I think you
 
02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
said before or disciplinary hearings
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
right have there been and uh you know
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we could measure that against the
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know the request for the fiscal no
 
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean in terms of you know
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
can I give you numbers for New Hampshire
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
I can't I mean I can what I can say is
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
that from around the country I think we
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
have seen you know it's been it's been
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
pretty well publicized in various places
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
of examples of
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
situations where you know the the for
 
02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term the cancel culture
 
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
has has uh has had sway um and I you
 
02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
know that's um that I think we should
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
not that is not a good thing that is
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
really not a good you know just not a
 
02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:37.269 align:start position:0%
really not a good you know just not a
good

02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
thing and are you aware of any um
 
02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:42.510 align:start position:0%
thing and are you aware of any um
significant

02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:36:45.389 --> 02:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
requests from members of the student
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
body or even professional staffs on
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
these campuses that believe this
 
02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
addition is important
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the I mean there's particular
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who say I was a victim of in
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
I can't say I Happ any in New Hampshire
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
but you know I again I go back
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
to I'm not sure that you can trust the
 
02:37:09.389 --> 02:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
fact that we haven't seen that to mean
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that it hasn't occurred because as I say
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
before you know if you're let's say
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're the student that was found to
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
have assaulted someone in a pro in a
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
process that that maybe the student
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
thinks well this wasn't really such a
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
fair process but you've got you've now
 
02:37:30.510 --> 02:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
been been found to have committed this
 
02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
assault are you going to you know maybe
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to be very brave and
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
say yep I don't want you know I this was
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
wrong I want I I want changes to be made
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
or maybe you're going to say Jesus you
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
know I don't want anybody to know about
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
this um I'm embarrassed by it I'm not
 
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
selling a soul and so I you know I don't
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
know I I I I don't think that that's
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily a very good indication of
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
not thank you actually um my colleague's
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
question kind of helped me answer a
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask Mickey in
 
02:38:07.870 --> 02:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
regards to how in God's name did you
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
come up with a fiscal note and it seems
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
to me that the fiscal note kind of
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
answers the number of cases where these
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
rights have not been afforded because
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
that to me is the estimate of the
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
resources that we would need to spend to
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
comply and therefore the university
 
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
itself is telling us that we have a lot
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
of these hearings where as of now all
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
those rights are not afforded and
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
therefore this is why it's rather
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
expensive to fix it so to me the proof
 
02:38:39.389 --> 02:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
is in the pudding if the fiscal note is
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
big is because there are a lot of these
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings happening that you know to
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
me if we are putting people in those
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
situations and have such serious
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
accusations look this is not about small
 
02:38:54.510 --> 02:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
things right most of these they never
 
02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
get to the point where you get a formal
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearing if the university I I spoke you
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
know I I I speak with the universities a
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
lot and if by any chance I misrepresent
 
02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
something that was said to me please
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
correct me we have University
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
representatives in the room but my
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
understanding is that most our
 
02:39:12.190 --> 02:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
situations are
 
02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
solved you know informally as inde you
 
02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
did something wrong you realize it yeah
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know and we move on it's when they
 
02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:21.389 align:start position:0%
you know and we move on it's when they
get

02:39:21.389 --> 02:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
contested that the expenses start
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
accumulating and those are the cases
 
02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
where I think we do have a duty to
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
protect those rights for everybody the
 
02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
rights of the victim the rights of the
 
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
accused the rights of everybody else on
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
the campus they are all meaningful and
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
we don't lose them when we go there so I
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
think that this is not as much a
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
question as a comment and I apologize
 
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
for not making that clear from the
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
beginning ital eliminates my question on
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
why the note is so big it's because
 
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of this stuff happening
 
02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
that we got to do it right thank you if
 
02:39:56.269 --> 02:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
I could just make one if I could just
 
02:39:59.469 --> 02:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
add one comment to that to
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
the I agree with what exactly with what
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
you said but I would I would just point
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
out one other thing to the extent that
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
the argument is made by the university
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
that you know their processes now really
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
are fair really are basically Fair
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
then I would suggest to you remember
 
02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does not it says if the
 
02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
nothing in in this bill prohibits in
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
fact it specifically says if they have
 
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.429 align:start position:0%
fact it specifically says if they have
equivalent

02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
procedures they can continue to use
 
02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
those procedures so if their procedures
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
really are basically the same and the
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
only thing I remember hearing when this
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
was before the education committee the
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
only one point that was raised was that
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
there was um maybe some time limits
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
weren't exactly the same as exist in in
 
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
some of their internal procedures well
 
02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
if that's the issue if the if the only
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
question is you know you need more time
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
or less time then change this bill by
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
all means change the bill to you know to
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
make the time limits comply I'm not the
 
02:41:00.349 --> 02:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
that if it's 10 days as opposed to 14
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
days or seven days as opposed to four
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's not to me that's not a huge a
 
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
huge issue I guess what I'm saying is
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
it's if the process is that the
 
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
university system and the community
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
college system is using right now is
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
really a basically Fair one then it's
 
02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
not very much different than what's in
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
here and there won't be much expense on
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
the other hand if it turn if it really
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
is considerably different than this then
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
maybe there will be more expense and
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
fairness thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
for I don't know if it's a question or
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
comments I'm going to make I sat in on
 
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
the education committee I've been
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
subbing in that committee lately um I
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
was there um I was there for the
 
02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
executing of this bill and I voted
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
against it um I feel very uncomfortable
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill we have our University
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
Systems have done a good job both at the
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
community college level and higher
 
02:42:08.269 --> 02:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
education I've received lots of comments
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
from lots of people who are very
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill I can't
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
possibly vote for it and and I just I
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to commend the university system in
 
02:42:19.469 --> 02:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
the community colleges for the work that
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
they've done they have a process and a
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
system that works well and you can't
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
present any data to us that says
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise I just feel very uncomfortable
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is Chad pintel I'm
 
02:42:51.309 --> 02:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
the general councel of the University
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire I have some
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues here who work in uh student
 
02:42:58.030 --> 02:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
discipline and in contract enforcement
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for hearing us out on
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
this um I want to make a couple of
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
points um about why the university
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
system even after this bill has been
 
02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
amended somewhat remains concerned by it
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the the first is that it is unclear
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
how this bill interacts with the
 
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
existing obligations that the university
 
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
system already has under Federal
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution federal law and our
 
02:43:22.590 --> 02:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
Collective barging agreements um I'll
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
give an example um and the details of
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
all this change depending on what group
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and what whichever
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
institutions you're talking about but if
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
a faculty member were to be terminated
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire now
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
um setting aside all of the informal and
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
sort of paperwork laying around it's
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
when actually gets time to move into the
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
formal process where they go is before
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
essentially uh Comm of their peers that
 
02:43:48.790 --> 02:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
go to a faculty committee who hears the
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
information and weighs in on whether or
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
not they think the faculty member ought
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
to be determinated because the faculty
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have shared governance with them and
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is part of their role um what
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking that into account the
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
administration makes a decision and then
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
under the collective Bing agreement that
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
is grievable that decision and that goes
 
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
all the way through um if it goes all
 
02:44:10.910 --> 02:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
the way arbitration in front of a
 
02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:12.750 align:start position:0%
the way arbitration in front of a
neutral

02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
arbitrator so that first hearing
 
02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
may not reach all of these 10 points
 
02:44:18.750 --> 02:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not designed to it's
 
02:44:21.150 --> 02:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
designed to get input from one of our
 
02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
shared governance Partners
 
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think raises the possibility that
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
if we're going to terminate a faculty
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
member at UNH under the current
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
Collective barging agreement we would
 
02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
have to have that hearing in front of
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
the faculty committee this hearing and
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
then it could be grieved and go all the
 
02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
way through arbitration um that is a
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
tremendous administrative burden to
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
engage in a single employment action uh
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I encourage my my colleagues to jump
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
up and seize me by the back of my my
 
02:44:50.990 --> 02:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
jacket if I've gotten that wrong um
 
02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's just one example another example
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
of of how this would interact in a
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
challenging way with um our federal law
 
02:44:59.950 --> 02:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
obligations is um to the extent that
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal law matter involved
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're meant to wait until the
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings are over before we
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
start our
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
own we have obligations under federal
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
civil rights law though that if the
 
02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
matter involved involves sexual violence
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment racial discrimination
 
02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
to take immediate action to rectify it
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
um the bill suggested that immediate
 
02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
action could be some kind of interim
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
suspension interim action but the
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
federal courts in the first circuit um
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
have made it pretty clear that that
 
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
long-term interim actions are not
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
permissible under the Federal
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution so we might be in a place
 
02:45:39.550 --> 02:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
where the Federal Constitution says we
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
have the federal law says we have to act
 
02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution says it can't
 
02:45:46.349 --> 02:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
be an interim action and state law says
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
we can't do a final action while we're
 
02:45:48.910 --> 02:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
waiting around for the criminal
 
02:45:51.389 --> 02:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
proceedings to end um we're stuck in a
 
02:45:54.269 --> 02:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
bit of a bind there and so again this a
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
this all a long way of saying where
 
02:45:58.349 --> 02:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
there are these points where it's
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
unclear how it fits together where there
 
02:46:01.710 --> 02:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
is at least a risk of a significantly
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
increased administrative burden to the
 
02:46:06.670 --> 02:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
system and there doesn't seem to be a
 
02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
current problem in our state in this
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
regard um the downsides don't seem to be
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
worth the added value from the
 
02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
University Systems perspective um my
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues may have more additional
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
information provide but I'll pause here
 
02:46:24.269 --> 02:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
if folks have questions I'll do my best
 
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
to answer them if I have
 
02:46:28.830 --> 02:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
it I'm just wondering um if you could
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of your systems
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action data
 
02:46:37.950 --> 02:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
um could you give us a rough rough
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
estimate um in any time frame that you
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
would like to select of how many
 
02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:43.469 align:start position:0%
would like to select of how many
disciplinary

02:46:43.469 --> 02:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
02:46:46.710 --> 02:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
hearings are undertaken by the system
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe you could speak to
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
the range of disciplinary hearings is it
 
02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
um anything from alcohol violations to
 
02:46:56.590 --> 02:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults or academic cheating
 
02:46:58.469 --> 02:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
maybe you could speak to that as well um
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I think if if we have our un D of
 
02:47:02.269 --> 02:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
students here I may actually defer to
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
him on that because he would be closer
 
02:47:05.230 --> 02:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
to that data um the point I would pick
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
out of your question though is while a
 
02:47:08.429 --> 02:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion we've had already has
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
been around sexual assault sexual
 
02:47:12.030 --> 02:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
violence issues this bill is not limited
 
02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
to that it's it's anything that rises to
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
a certain level of and so it's the again
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
from an administrative burden
 
02:47:18.670 --> 02:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
perspective the breadth of it is
 
02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
slightly bigger than I think we've been
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
maybe talking about captur in this
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.309 --> 02:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
Potato

02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
Potato
 
02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
is ah that sounds better so Michael
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
Blackman Dena students at the University
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire where I've been for
 
02:48:03.790 --> 02:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
about three years now so I just want to
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
say from the beginning that we overall
 
02:48:08.510 --> 02:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
support the spirit of the bill that we
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
believe due process protections are
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
critical for any student that is at risk
 
02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
for being sanctioned through our conduct
 
02:48:16.830 --> 02:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
process proc any student that goes
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
through the conduct process at the
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire is afforded
 
02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
substantial due process protections that
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
are clearly defined in our student
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
rights rules and responsibilities
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
handbook and our code of conduct and we
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
believe these are necessary due process
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
protections to protect the property
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
rights of these students who have paid
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
for their education and should have
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
access to it without being deprived
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
without a
 
02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
process the key thing to keep in mind is
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the due process protections we
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
afford to students are based on the
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
potential severity of the sanction so
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
for an underage student that is caught
 
02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
drinking at a
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
party that student meets with a trained
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
staff member and has due process
 
02:48:57.630 --> 02:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
protections including the right to
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
respond meaningfully the right to be
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
provided notice and the right to an
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
impartial decision
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
maker that student is likely going to
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
get a warning and an educational
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
sanction as a result of that underage
 
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
drinking violation we do not bring every
 
02:49:16.349 --> 02:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
single student that was in that party in
 
02:49:18.670 --> 02:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
for cross-examination it is not a good
 
02:49:20.670 --> 02:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
use of those students time it is not a
 
02:49:22.269 --> 02:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
good use of the respondents time and
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a necessary step to protect
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
someone from getting something like a
 
02:49:28.349 --> 02:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
warning and an educational sanction to
 
02:49:31.229 --> 02:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
give some data to this as was asked last
 
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
year we had about 3,000 cases go through
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
the conduct system at the University of
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only about 80 of those
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
cases resulted in a hearing with due
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
process protections that more closely
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
align with what's outlined in the this
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
bill and those are cases where a student
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
was at risk for being suspended from the
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
University suspended from housing
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
removed from the University or removed
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
from housing we afford much more
 
02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
substantial due process Protections in
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
those cases and they represent about a
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
fraction of what we deal with on a
 
02:50:03.229 --> 02:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis so to speak
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
specifically about the fiscal note and
 
02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
the financial implications one thing
 
02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was appreciated in the amendment is
 
02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
that the bar raised for when this would
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
apply for students is suspensions and
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
above which is very helpful we still
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
believe that we would require additional
 
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
staff because the way that the bill is
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
written uh it still broadens when we
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
need to have hearings for student
 
02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
organizations again for even very
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
lowlevel violations it's also not clear
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill doesn't apply to academic
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
suspensions which is not handled through
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
a hearing process when a student is
 
02:50:41.550 --> 02:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
suspended for a very low
 
02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:46.279 align:start position:0%
GPA um but the real added con C here is
 
02:50:48.750 --> 02:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
as Chad spoke to the the cost of
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
Defending ourselves against many
 
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits which we believe we would incur
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
based on the Amendments addition of us
 
02:50:58.510 --> 02:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
needing to wait for criminal processes
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be done before taking any action
 
02:51:03.630 --> 02:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
against a student so I would our
 
02:51:04.990 --> 02:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
director of community standards can
 
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong about this but
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
if you think about those 80 hearings I
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
describ before I would estimate at least
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
2third of them they were criminal
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
charges at Play these are processes that
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
can take months or years to resolve and
 
02:51:20.590 --> 02:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
we are obligated by the federal
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
government to move quickly through our
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
processes to safeguard the community an
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
interim restriction is actually
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the due process rights
 
02:51:31.309 --> 02:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
in the bill because what we're doing is
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're removing a student from their
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
Education Without a process we're
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
interim suspending them without
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
affording them the full process that has
 
02:51:41.070 --> 02:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
also been slapped down in courts within
 
02:51:43.950 --> 02:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
this circuit as as a as a method that we
 
02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
cannot employ we cannot interim suspend
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
students for years while we wait for a
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice process to finish so
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
our estimate for the cost is based on
 
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that many individuals that go
 
02:51:57.150 --> 02:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
through these hearings would be able to
 
02:51:59.790 --> 02:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
successfully sue us because it is in
 
02:52:02.429 --> 02:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
conflict with the expectations outlined
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
by sub-regulatory guidance from the
 
02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and also case
 
02:52:08.229 --> 02:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
law that suggests that we do have an
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to quickly protect our
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
community when there is potential for
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
violence or
 
02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
harm I'll pause there and take questions
 
02:52:19.870 --> 02:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I had one quick
 
02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
question um earlier but I didn't want to
 
02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
interrupt your testimony you were
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the um scenario where a u
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
underage drinking may u happen and uh
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
that in that situation you don't feel
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
the need to uh you know cross-examine
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
other students and so on and so forth as
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
far as I understand this bill says they
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
can cross-examine your accusers you know
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
or Witnesses brought I mean unless the
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
University uses those people as you know
 
02:52:48.229 --> 02:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
they they brought the complaint or they
 
02:52:48.239 --> 02:52:49.070 align:start position:0%
they they brought the complaint or they
are

02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses I'm I'm not sure what you
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
meant because the only people I can
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
think of that would need to be
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
cross-examined are people who either
 
02:52:58.790 --> 02:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
make the accusation or testify that that
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
happened sure why would you feel that
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary to cross-examine
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
them when they are bringing you evidence
 
02:53:07.389 --> 02:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
that's used that now the accused person
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
would not be able to question sure I I
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
would say two things the first is that
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
the people that I'm referring to when
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Witnesses if there
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
was underage drinking at a party that
 
02:53:19.950 --> 02:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
party could have 20 30 40 students
 
02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
present the accused could actually be a
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
member of our University Police
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
Department or the Durham Police
 
02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
Department um so we're talking about
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
substantial amounts of students that
 
02:53:31.469 --> 02:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
witness the case and also staff members
 
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
raas Hall directors police officers that
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
were bringing forth the case and all of
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
that in a situation where the sanction
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
is likely going to be a warning and for
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
students as has been asked at this group
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
who is complaining about this I would
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
say that many of our students believe
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
that an appropriate resolution to the
 
02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
potential of getting a warning for an
 
02:53:56.830 --> 02:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
underage drinking violation when a
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
19-year-old is caught with a beer is to
 
02:54:01.870 --> 02:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
have notice of what they're accused of a
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity to respond and an
 
02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
impartial decision maker making that
 
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
decision that they would not need to
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
bring their friends in who are at the
 
02:54:13.870 --> 02:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
party to be cross-examined that the
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
police officers would need to be
 
02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
cross-examined and that's just one
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
example of a due process protection that
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
we usually we reserve for those
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
situations where student is at risk for
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
significant deprivation of their
 
02:54:27.630 --> 02:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
education suspensions suspensions from
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
housing dismissals removals from housing
 
02:54:32.510 --> 02:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
not the
 
02:54:34.750 --> 02:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
2,920 cases that we resolve through
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
conduct conferences with a trained staff
 
02:54:39.710 --> 02:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
member a quick follow-up question sorry
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
before the question just a quick comment
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah while I'm not going to talk about
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
the specifics I'm aware of at least one
 
02:54:48.309 --> 02:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
case in which somebody was incorrectly
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
accused of drinking and in this process
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
they probably would have gotten a
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
warning even though they didn't do
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
anything but since I'm not able to you
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
know discuss a situation in particular
 
02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that such situations have
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
been known to occur everywhere and I
 
02:55:05.590 --> 02:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
would feel that before you warn somebody
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
for having some done something wrong you
 
02:55:09.710 --> 02:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
should be reasonably sure that they
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
really did something wrong this being
 
02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
said again just a comment it's my
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
opinion the question is um actually I
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
managed to forget my question I
 
02:55:22.269 --> 02:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
apologize I took myself out of it I I
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
the floor sorry may I respond by what
 
02:55:27.229 --> 02:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
means I I would just say that it is far
 
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
from the the purpose of the conduct
 
02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
process and the student having a
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity to respond is to
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
reassure students that these processes
 
02:55:36.750 --> 02:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
are far from decided before they get
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
that opportunity so um when I say that a
 
02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
warning is a potential sanction that's
 
02:55:43.309 --> 02:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's a potential sanction
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's far from cited and our director of
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
community standards could speak more to
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
this but we do not have a 100%
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility rate students go to these
 
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
meetings they share their side of the
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
story and many of these students are
 
02:55:57.790 --> 02:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
found not responsible I can't speak to
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
your specific case obviously but these
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
meeting sure thank you
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
all swear to God I'm going to start
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
though may I just make one other comment
 
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
I I think it's important with regard to
 
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
what the last witness said I I I think I
 
02:56:36.030 --> 02:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
what much of what he said actually
 
02:56:38.269 --> 02:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
supports the view that this bill is a
 
02:56:40.030 --> 02:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
good idea because what he really is
 
02:56:43.150 --> 02:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
saying and I'm I'm sure it's right that
 
02:56:46.510 --> 02:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know 90% in the in the criminal
 
02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
justice system 95% of cases don't go to
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
trial they result they result in a in a
 
02:56:57.150 --> 02:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
negotiated plea disposition that's I'm
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
sure that in this in the college
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process that's true too I I
 
02:57:06.150 --> 02:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
have no doubt that many many the vast
 
02:57:07.830 --> 02:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
majority of cases where there are sort
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
of some minor the the drinking situation
 
02:57:13.630 --> 02:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
or somebody being boisterous those those
 
02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
are not going to end up in a hearing
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to resolve because the the
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
the university official is going to say
 
02:57:21.309 --> 02:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
look here's the evidence that we're that
 
02:57:22.750 --> 02:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to pursue
 
02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to offer against you if you
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
go to a hearing and the person is going
 
02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
to say you know yeah I was drunk that
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
night and I don't you know I don't want
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
to drag this out and and have a and have
 
02:57:35.590 --> 02:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
a hearing and it's going to resolve but
 
02:57:38.750 --> 02:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
this and and and in that case just as in
 
02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
the plea bargain in a criminal case
 
02:57:42.429 --> 02:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
there will be no trial there will be
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
there will be no hearing and
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
cross-examination and all
 
02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
that but this is important because there
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
will be some cases in which in which
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
people will say I didn't do it and so
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's drinking or sexual
 
02:58:01.309 --> 02:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
assault or whatever and I want to have
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
my day in court or my day of a hearing
 
02:58:06.349 --> 02:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
in the in the disciplinary process and
 
02:58:10.229 --> 02:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
so it's those few cases that where the
 
02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
rights here are particularly important
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
most of them they will you know they
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
won't they won't go to the hearing
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be no hearing it'll be resolved
 
02:58:24.190 --> 02:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:26.670 --> 02:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank good afternoon I'm Shannon Reed
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
representing the community college
 
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire um there's
 
02:58:31.950 --> 02:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
really not much additive that I can say
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
um to expand on what's been said by U
 
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
previous speakers and I say I'm
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
particularly to follow the former Chief
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
Justice on some of these broad matters
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
but I would say that we certainly share
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns of of our colleagues at the
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
University system but but I would also
 
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
say that um well two things one it seems
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
that folks are are concerned or worried
 
02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
that that there would not be due process
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
rights without this bill and and I can
 
02:58:57.309 --> 02:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
assure you that that's not that's not
 
02:58:58.830 --> 02:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
the case we have robust and
 
02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive policies that that work
 
02:59:02.429 --> 02:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
well for us and Serv us well as an
 
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
educational institution we are not um
 
02:59:07.710 --> 02:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
we're not courts these are employment
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
matters there student organization and
 
02:59:10.750 --> 02:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary matters it's it's really a
 
02:59:13.630 --> 02:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
different level of um a different level
 
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
of of severity but but the second thing
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to say is we did submit
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statements and if you are
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
considering passing this bill or moving
 
02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
it Forward I hope that you will also
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
consider the fiscal impact on our
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
organizations and include an
 
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation at least to help us adjust
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
to whatever new expectations this bill
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
would would create new requirements need
 
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
for new training need for in our case
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and I believe I heard the
 
02:59:39.550 --> 02:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
University's case for new Personnel um
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
so I I would say that if you
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
do decide to move this forward I I hope
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
that you will support it with funding
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
that will help us not have to make Cuts
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in order to accommodate there
 
02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
new requirements of this
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:00:00.030 --> 03:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um M re I'm sure this
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
will be an easy
 
03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
response um are you aware um and is it
 
03:00:10.150 --> 03:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
true that um if a student or employee of
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
the system is unfairly disciplined and
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
separated from the
 
03:00:17.190 --> 03:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
institution because of a alleged
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
violation of their due process is it
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that they can proceed to
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
litigation using the court system to to
 
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
um resolve that
 
03:00:30.429 --> 03:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
grievance I believe that's the case
 
03:00:30.439 --> 03:00:34.550 align:start position:0%
grievance I believe that's the case
thank

03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you got turn my mic on would
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
you like to
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
comment no oh okay cuz you were kind of
 
03:00:45.309 --> 03:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
I thought you were jumping out of your
 
03:00:45.319 --> 03:00:46.670 align:start position:0%
I thought you were jumping out of your
chair

03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:00:50.429 --> 03:00:50.439 align:start position:0%
though anyone else like to
 
03:00:54.229 --> 03:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
comment yeah if I may just again suggest
 
03:00:57.150 --> 03:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
that um discussing policy is fun and
 
03:01:00.190 --> 03:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
important but at the end of the day you
 
03:01:03.269 --> 03:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
know we're here to look at the money and
 
03:01:05.950 --> 03:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time all we have on
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
the financial on the fiscal note is the
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
estimate uh you know provided and
 
03:01:12.269 --> 03:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
prepared by the staff and everybody's
 
03:01:15.630 --> 03:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
done their best I think that given the
 
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
importance of such rights I uh you know
 
03:01:20.830 --> 03:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
I agree that we have to pay for the
 
03:01:23.229 --> 03:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
mandates that we place on our public
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning so um I
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
can assure everybody that uh you know I
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
will do everything I can to make sure
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
obviously the funds are available
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
because you got to be able to do the job
 
03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
you can we have the flexibility of
 
03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
making this um take place in the next
 
03:01:52.229 --> 03:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
budget like making the effective date
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
later so that we we are discussing this
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're discussing their
 
03:02:00.750 --> 03:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
you so let me ask you just for clarity I
 
03:02:09.389 --> 03:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
I the effective date on on this was July
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
1 of
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
2025 so automatically goes to the next
 
03:02:14.479 --> 03:02:18.309 align:start position:0%
2025 so automatically goes to the next
budget

03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.990 --> 03:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
right so this would be cons there's no
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
money right but there could be by the
 
03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
money right but there could be by the
time

03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:32.590 align:start position:0%
time
yes

03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
y so is your is your recommendation then
 
03:02:40.910 --> 03:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
to move this forward as it is unfunded
 
03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
and then pick it up in the budget or
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
is that your is that a
 
03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:49.150 align:start position:0%
is that your is that a
motion

03:02:49.150 --> 03:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:02:51.630 --> 03:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
okay do we have the
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
second second U just two quick comments
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me in a situation like
 
03:02:58.229 --> 03:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
this the fiscal note is really kind of
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetical guessing at what might
 
03:03:01.950 --> 03:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
happen not what is happening now and so
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have a good sense of
 
03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
what that miscal note represents and the
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
other thing I have to say after
 
03:03:09.030 --> 03:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
listening to representative Lynn speak
 
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
the second time it sounds to me like he
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
agrees with Mr Blackman which would make
 
03:03:13.279 --> 03:03:16.830 align:start position:0%
agrees with Mr Blackman which would make
the

03:03:16.830 --> 03:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary well there was a certain
 
03:03:23.469 --> 03:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
element there because if you read these
 
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
steps every every infraction gets every
 
03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
step and I think uh representative Lyn's
 
03:03:37.630 --> 03:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
comments was that's not the case only
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
the steps that apply and you can you can
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
plead you can plead out a deal without
 
03:03:51.550 --> 03:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.030 --> 03:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's HED can stop it essentially at
 
03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
any time by saying okay you know I don't
 
03:03:58.950 --> 03:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
want to contest any further I'll accept
 
03:04:01.229 --> 03:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
whatever discipline whatever so we're
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
only talking about cases where the the
 
03:04:05.469 --> 03:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
accuse says no I didn't do it and I'm
 
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna we're going to have a fight on
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
our hands right or or cases where the
 
03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
accuse where where the system says we
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
want expell you and the student says
 
03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I you know maybe I did do
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
something wrong but you know a 3we
 
03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:22.630 align:start position:0%
something wrong but you know a 3we
suspension

03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
03:04:27.229 --> 03:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
is muchi if you're you're throw me out
 
03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
then I want to hear
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
are okay any other comment yes thanks I
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
just like to take a moment to talk about
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
um the financial implications of
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
attempting to establish a secondary
 
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
pseudo judicial process through the
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
education you know our educational
 
03:04:49.389 --> 03:04:49.399 align:start position:0%
institutions that would be running in
 
03:04:52.670 --> 03:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
parallel to an actual judicial process
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
of the state you know it seems to me
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire's
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have already paid for one
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
court system and that a second court
 
03:05:02.229 --> 03:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
system is not necessary and that I think
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that would be a large dra drag on
 
03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
you know the Public's use of funds so I
 
03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
can't support this spill at all I think
 
03:05:12.190 --> 03:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
that this is um I think that the
 
03:05:14.910 --> 03:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
intention is well-meaning but that I
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
think you know that the big ask of using
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
these funds to create a second parallel
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
judicial system is inappropriate is an
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriate use of funds I can't
 
03:05:23.399 --> 03:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
inappropriate use of funds I can't
support

03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
it okay I think in this case we'll have
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
we'll ask the clerk to call a
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%

panel is there anyone here that would
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:06:46.429 --> 03:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mark PR Hillsboro
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
15 I brought forth this bill um for a
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons um full disclosure I'm
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
a firefighter EMT so I've seen how the
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
old process works and we needed to
 
03:07:03.870 --> 03:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
update it and it's been updated to uh
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
resemble all the other boards that are
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
in like oplc and things like that
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
originally one person was making the
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
determination on whether somebody was
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to be uh suspended license revoked
 
03:07:21.150 --> 03:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
or any things like that and there's
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually two pieces to to this bill so
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
that first piece is one person was
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
making that
 
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
decision and there was no time
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
constraints on how long they could take
 
03:07:38.110 --> 03:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
to make that decision and here you have
 
03:07:39.630 --> 03:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
somebody whose
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
livelihood is pending for a long time
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
time right
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
so the case that kind of brought this to
 
03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
me is someone had to make a life in
 
03:07:51.160 --> 03:07:51.950 align:start position:0%
me is someone had to make a life in
death

03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
death
 
03:07:55.630 --> 03:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
decision somebody questioned it it went
 
03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
on for over 11 months almost a year with
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
very little information coming back to
 
03:08:06.510 --> 03:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
her on how this was
 
03:08:09.870 --> 03:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
progressing what was going on so every
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
day she woke up not knowing
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
so in in my bill I put that they have 90
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
days to come
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
up and at least send this person an
 
03:08:26.030 --> 03:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
update of why it's taken longer than 90
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
days and give an update on the case and
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
then every 30 days following
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we are creating a three member
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
panel uh taking it away from the one
 
03:08:43.710 --> 03:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
person the commissioner of
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
safety the other piece of that is that
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
they have a web page that list everyone
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
who's been
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
disciplined uh and you were going to
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
stay on that list
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
forever I actually had a a close
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
personal friend who was on that list who
 
03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
personal friend who was on that list who
passed

03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:09:08.590 --> 03:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
away the family asked me to reach out
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
and get the name removed and I was told
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
nope we can't do that because there's
 
03:09:16.269 --> 03:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that allows us to do that
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
I said it's not like she's coming back
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
for her
 
03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
job right and they said no can't do it I
 
03:09:23.790 --> 03:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
said well I'm going to go fix that and
 
03:09:26.590 --> 03:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
as I started to try and fix that problem
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
I looked at the bigger problem and
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
figured out I might as well try and
 
03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
bring this system up to date with what
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
the state is doing for the rest of the
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
boards and that's if you have questions
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try and answer them
 
03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:43.510 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try and answer them
questions

03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
yes could you describe under current the
 
03:09:49.469 --> 03:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
current process um who is making those
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
decisions Commissioner of safety so the
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
director of
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
EMS will recommend to the commissioner
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
and he can either take that
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation or make it on his own
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
and not to be derogatory but here you
 
03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
have a police
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
officer making EMS
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
decisions which didn't make sense to
 
03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:16.750 align:start position:0%
decisions which didn't make sense to
me

03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay question thank you Mr chair I do
 
03:10:22.269 --> 03:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
have a question in the in that office of
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards is there just one
 
03:10:27.070 --> 03:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
person that that's regulating all the
 
03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
different professions no not not how I
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
know it each each one has their own
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
little board I guess they still have
 
03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
them and and they have their own
 
03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
procedures for discipline but as far as
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
I know they all have a minimum of three
 
03:10:47.269 --> 03:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
on their disciplinary board thank
 
03:10:47.279 --> 03:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
on their disciplinary board thank
you

03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:10:52.510 --> 03:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you can you explain about
 
03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
question thank you can you explain about
the

03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
um seven years from the disciplinary
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
date um that you would like to have the
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
name removed um I guess two questions of
 
03:11:04.110 --> 03:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
you know the most basic one is like why
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
also aren't there a range of reasons why
 
03:11:11.190 --> 03:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
you would be on the list some more minor
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
than others and if there is a major one
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
why would you want that removed after
 
03:11:18.190 --> 03:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
seven years so you get removed from the
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
web page but it goes into your file and
 
03:11:23.070 --> 03:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
stays there forever so it's not like
 
03:11:27.070 --> 03:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
that infraction disappears it's just
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
more out of the public view so if you
 
03:11:30.269 --> 03:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
were going to hire
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
somebody you would approach the state
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
and said hey what's in their file and
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
the state would let you know but it's
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little bit and that's
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
what all the other boards and oplc do as
 
03:11:44.990 --> 03:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
well so I'm just trying to align it with
 
03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:46.469 align:start position:0%
well so I'm just trying to align it with
with

03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:11:49.150 --> 03:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
every yeah I guess you I sort of
 
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
answered it when you said to align it
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
with the other boards but when you're
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
looking at elements of safety um I sort
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
of feel an obligation that the public
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe it's more important for the public
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to know who's on that list as
 
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to any of the other B LIC so the
 
03:12:06.030 --> 03:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
phys board the nursing board the Dental
 
03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
Board all those people are out in seven
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
you another question yes thank you Mr
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
question representative um I see in the
 
03:12:19.990 --> 03:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it talks about the
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
department stating that it would need to
 
03:12:24.190 --> 03:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
hire a part-time administrator one to
 
03:12:27.630 --> 03:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
administer the ma to manage the work of
 
03:12:30.190 --> 03:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation um and that it would
 
03:12:33.389 --> 03:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
start November 1st 2024 so maybe
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
potentially later this year um do you
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
have any comments about you know I'm not
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure why they have to hire somebody
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
because there's not that that many
 
03:12:45.750 --> 03:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
infractions that happen they are far and
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
few between and I know the uh director
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
has the ability to uh issue letters of
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
concern which are like a warning and
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
they use those quite a bit
 
03:12:59.630 --> 03:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
so there's really no Administration with
 
03:13:03.550 --> 03:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
that but to suspend and revoke um
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're already do they already have an
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
investigator and a part-time
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
investigator that will uh present the
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
facts to the to the board so I'm kind of
 
03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
missing where the extra Administration
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
is follow yeah I'm looking at the
 
03:13:23.790 --> 03:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
allocation the 23, 350 and um just my
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
guess is that this is probably a
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
part-time like a FTE essentially so
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
maybe they're just looking for a little
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
you does this uh board charge dues or
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
fees or anything is there does it have a
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism so no so there are
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
three other boards that are associated
 
03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
with EMS there's a protocol board
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
there's a medical Direction board and
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the life of me I can't remember the
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
third that are already in place that
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
work with the EMS bureau and we're
 
03:14:06.910 --> 03:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
taking one member from each of
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
those uh as an additional duty to to
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
what they do now th do those boards have
 
03:14:17.309 --> 03:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
administrative support I believe so okay
 
03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
because I this may be
 
03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the funding other
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:36.920 align:start position:0%

04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
your we're swapped here all right oh
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:26:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
being I'm expecting that thank 35 we
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
1583 uh just get as a little bit of an
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
update uh
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
1583 uh has a is carrying a a a c cost
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
of about $100 million give or take is
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
that a little bit less per year yeah 90
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
million 8 I mean yes as it currently
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
stands what I what you've received is I
 
04:27:22.990 --> 04:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
I uh propose a an
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and it was kind of interesting
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
I served on a special Committee of uh
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy and it was like we were talk I
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
was in Lily put because some people
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to based on output and some
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
people want to based on input so it was
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
kind of an interesting interesting
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue to see but as an outsider I can
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
look at well I'll give you a third
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
one the Judgment from the
 
04:27:54.910 --> 04:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
conal uh judge was the adequacy should
 
04:27:54.920 --> 04:27:56.550 align:start position:0%
conal uh judge was the adequacy should
be

04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:27:56.560 --> 04:27:58.189 align:start position:0%
be
$735

04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
$735
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
And1 per student so I'm starting
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
there how they got it I have no idea
 
04:28:08.309 --> 04:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to say that it was
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and this this was the answer
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
so th this moves the adequacy from the
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
$4,100 in uh in the in the bill to the
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
$7,000 number let me give you the
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
overview of the of the amendment there's
 
04:28:28.349 --> 04:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
three parts to this
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the first part
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
is redefining what was the word that we
 
04:28:39.630 --> 04:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
use this recar recharacterizing that's
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
it what we're going to what we have
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
right now is the state spend for
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
education is over $3
 
04:28:50.429 --> 04:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
million combined state and
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
local what the first section does is it
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
recharacterized some of the local
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
education tax into
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
swep so swept goes up local taxes go
 
04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
down so the taxpayer is paying the same
 
04:29:09.070 --> 04:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money we basically just said
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
okay this portion of your locally
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
collected education tax is now going to
 
04:29:15.070 --> 04:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
be called
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
swep so you'll see that the the total
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
swep is now
 
04:29:24.429 --> 04:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
773 million instead of the 300 whatever
 
04:29:24.439 --> 04:29:25.950 align:start position:0%
773 million instead of the 300 whatever
63

04:29:25.950 --> 04:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
63
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
363 so now it's 733
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.830 --> 04:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
now it's page one it's in the amendment
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's in the amendment that I passed
 
04:29:44.189 --> 04:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
one l 10
 
04:29:52.349 --> 04:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
11 l 10 11
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
11 all right page two largely speaks to
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
a a c
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
a ceiling on local appro
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation the reason for this is if
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
we are going to increase the
 
04:30:13.229 --> 04:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
swep or the
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy we don't want then also have
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
the local taxing Authority in education
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
saying well we we're going to bump it
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
back up and charge everything we were
 
04:30:25.710 --> 04:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
because now we got we got the same money
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
the same taxpayer getting having a bump
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
up so what this does it says you can
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
increase based on cost of living or an
 
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
if your legislative body by a two-thirds
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
vote wants to increase your uh your your
 
04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
budget but other than that it only it's
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
approximately okay that's the that's
 
04:30:53.960 --> 04:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
approximately okay that's the that's
page

04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:30:59.070 --> 04:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
two and P and by the way I'm not looking
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
to vote on this
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
today all right the the intention here
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
is to pass it out give you time to
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
digest and we'll do this at another time
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
chair Okay the third page is basically
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
the swept portion for the towns that
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
have excess
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
swept and it was the brand decision that
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it it was a conval
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
decision that says you can't you can't
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
keep it it's got to go back to the state
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
because it's called Statewide education
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
property tax so any excess in my town is
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
one of them goes back to the goes back
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
to the state that's what page three is
 
04:31:43.239 --> 04:31:44.630 align:start position:0%
to the state that's what page three is
thank

04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:31:49.229 --> 04:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
pieces does anybody have
 
04:31:51.880 --> 04:31:53.630 align:start position:0%
pieces does anybody have
any

04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions so this basically does away
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
was swept entirely no no no no no no
 
04:32:04.710 --> 04:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay it it it it doubles swept basically
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but it goes to the state that
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay in the
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
municipality yes excess the excess goes
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
to the state and set of states with the
 
04:32:14.159 --> 04:32:15.630 align:start position:0%
to the state and set of states with the
municipality

04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so um first
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
obviously as representing wiam which uh
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
will uh suffer a significant financial
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
burden as a result of that Court
 
04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
decision I understand that there is not
 
04:32:31.630 --> 04:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
much what we can what we we can do about
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
it but let's just say that U it will be
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
hard to to explain that one home but uh
 
04:32:41.710 --> 04:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
my question is when we um control the
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
growth of the budget how do we account
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
for communities where the population is
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
increasing or decreasing because you
 
04:32:53.109 --> 04:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
know one of the concerns in wind is that
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
we are one of the few towns that keeps
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
increasing in population so we are under
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of pressure and if we would
 
04:33:03.229 --> 04:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
be tied to no if you read it I did not
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
read P you haven't had a chance yet if
 
04:33:07.709 --> 04:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
your population is increasing you can
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
increase your budget good thank
 
04:33:10.879 --> 04:33:12.910 align:start position:0%
increase your budget good thank
you

04:33:12.910 --> 04:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um now I'm
 
04:33:19.709 --> 04:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
confused we have your Amendment yes and
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
we had
 
04:33:25.150 --> 04:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
1583 but passed on the floor right what
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
does this do to that it it's an
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
addition so all of all of all of this
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
stays all all of it stays and this is
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
you now we have a lot of
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
information about what stays if you want
 
04:33:49.709 --> 04:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
to get into that now we can do it now
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
and we can pass it out now and then
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
discuss it when we reconvene on this why
 
04:33:57.789 --> 04:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
don't you mark why who Mickey who's got
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
something they want to pass out let's go
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr chair I think we'd be great if
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
people could hear what would happen
 
04:34:05.709 --> 04:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
during the subcommittee because think we
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
work and I know many of us followed
 
04:34:14.189 --> 04:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
along U while the subcommittee was
 
04:34:15.789 --> 04:34:15.799 align:start position:0%
meeting but not everybody heard every
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.680 --> 04:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
recap

04:34:23.750 --> 04:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
recap
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
well I
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
I I kind of preempted the meeting quite
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
honestly that's what I'm saying there
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
was all a whole bunch of logic for
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
outputs and a whole bunch of logic for
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
inputs and I said well let's take the
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
judge's input start there okay and can I
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
justify this number absolutely not all I
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
know is that's what the judge said yeah
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.119 --> 04:35:13.470 align:start position:0%
 
get

04:35:13.470 --> 04:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
top

04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
time am I correct this is this is pre
 
04:36:04.799 --> 04:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
time am I correct this is this is pre
pre

04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
pre
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment the these are for House Bill
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
1583 as it passed the house not the Emer
 
04:36:13.119 --> 04:36:16.709 align:start position:0%
1583 as it passed the house not the Emer
Amendment

04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.590 --> 04:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
right so so everybody check your
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
town okay let's get
 
04:36:23.279 --> 04:36:33.789 align:start position:0%
town okay let's get
down

04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
51 I don't know I I got to study this on
 
04:36:52.590 --> 04:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.600 --> 04:36:54.349 align:start position:0%
 
tiny

04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
tiny
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
would mark would you like to make any
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
comments yeah no if you have any
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
questions um I'll try to see if I can
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
help if we have any questions don't
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't put on
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
question you have any um so so Mickey
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
put together Mickey put together these
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
um these documents um so he can speak to
 
04:37:16.150 --> 04:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
them in more detail but um yes uh as it
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
amended the house floor and came over to
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
this committee there was fiscal capacity
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid which for fiscal year 24
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
is around $39 million and uh relief Aid
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
which um in in Mickey spreadsheets is
 
04:37:32.189 --> 04:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
around $22 million um so that's the $61
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
million increase remember relief Aid is
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
targeting communities that have high fnr
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
percentages um and fiscal capacity to
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid is based on the students
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
and property so if you have low property
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
values relative to how much students you
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
have um you get more fiscal capacity to
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid so um that was the work of
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee as representative emmer
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
talked about um and then got introduced
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
into 1583 and passed the house floor um
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
so that was the bill as you received it
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
and Mickey has also he's done fiscal
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
year 25 26 27 and he's done a little bit
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
of forecasting on the impacts of um of
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
these programs going forward um so how
 
04:38:16.109 --> 04:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
the the law uh the bill as amended would
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
potentially adjust um and he had to make
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
some difficult assumptions assumptions
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
we typically don't make which is growth
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
in property value because it's been so
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
substantial so I think Mickey uh we
 
04:38:30.429 --> 04:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
looked at some data and 7% seemed good
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
um we have no clue if property values
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
will go by 7% next year but um kind had
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
he kind of had to plug a number in there
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a fair number um so
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see those reflected in that
 
04:38:42.189 --> 04:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
estimate and essentially as property
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
value grows at a rate of 7% you would
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
expect fiscal capacity to disparity Aid
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
to decrease faster than uh uh it would
 
04:38:51.869 --> 04:38:51.879 align:start position:0%
just decrease because property values
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
would grow faster than the adjustment
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
factors because the adjustment factor in
 
04:38:59.070 --> 04:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is 2% um so that's you're
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
seeing you're actually seeing a decline
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
in funding uh and some of that's based
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
on student enrollment declines well
 
04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
actually you're not seeing a decline
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're seeing uh it stay kind of flat
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
and some of that's because of student
 
04:39:12.510 --> 04:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment declines that Mickey uh put
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
into his assumption but also um growth
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
and property values that Mickey put in
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
his assumptions okay and I I have one
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
more detail of what my Amendment does is
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
million in in my bill it will go closer
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
to $91 million excess swept so more
 
04:39:42.190 --> 04:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
swept 91
 
04:39:45.240 --> 04:39:49.628 align:start position:0%
swept 91
million

04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:49.638 --> 04:39:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
29

04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
29
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
yes um I'm not I don't think it's just
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
me but I'm feeling a little overwhelmed
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
the your your amendment is very
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
different from the bill and so I'm um
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
would either like to hear um if
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
education has had a chance or maybe Mark
 
04:40:10.590 --> 04:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Mel would know as well um you gave an
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
overview of the changes um but I need
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
someone to help me knit the two together
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
to understand what the differences are
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
and what the impacts of those
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
differences are and you know I'm just a
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.440 --> 04:40:28.948 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
1583 I I can help out there uh so so 15
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
1583 as that amended is is very similar
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
to what you've been doing as a as a body
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
for a while now is you're you're
 
04:40:42.550 --> 04:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
focusing on targeting Aid to communities
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
that need it and so physical capacity
 
04:40:45.628 --> 04:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
disparity a targets communities that
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
have low property values relief Aid
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
targets it so that is uh um you know 60
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
million in targeted a that's what the
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill you received what representative
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
Em's uh Amendment does is it's dressing
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
the conval order and the Rand order so
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
the conval order came out February 20th
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it said immediately this is a
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
suprior court order immediately you need
 
04:41:10.510 --> 04:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
to start paying
 
04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
$735 in one penny in base adequacy Aid
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
um So currently that is an order that is
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh has not been stayed um the state
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
tried uh made a motion to stay the
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
motion to stay was uh denied uh this um
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
the doj is going to appeal to the
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um to see what happens
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
there um we have not heard from the
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I believe they've filed
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
their motion already um so what
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative em done uh amendment is
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
doing is addressing that requirement
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
that base Aid shall be 3,5 uh 3
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
7,356 one cent in one cense and um how
 
04:41:50.750 --> 04:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
does that pertain to um disparity Aid
 
04:41:54.310 --> 04:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
and it's on independent uh go away I
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
mean I need I'd like to know what's the
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
impact that has on these other things
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
stays exactly the same except for the
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
swept but won't these numbers change if
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
we're bringing up the 7,000 won't the
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
numbers on these things change and so
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's I'm kind of where I'm going is to
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
see what the impact
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
is so you don't have you don't have you
 
04:42:15.310 --> 04:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
don't have uh the latest Amendment you
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that town by town in front of
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
you you don't have the um the bottom
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
line figures in front of you uh so so
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
raising base a up to 7,000 that does not
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
touch any other component of the formula
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't touch physical capacity
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs hold harmless um
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
well actually for fiscal year 25 it does
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the hold harmless um that's a
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
technical issue but uh it's uh uh not
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
not not impacting the additional Aid
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
programs uh for the most part then
 
04:42:46.350 --> 04:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
there's the swept increase the swept
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
increase is currently 363 million in law
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
um this amendment brings it to 773
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
million um and then has it uh
 
04:42:57.628 --> 04:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
essentially float going forward and
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
likely will land around that $773
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
million um in the fiscal years Beyond
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 so the way a swept
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
increase works is uh so increasing your
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
base adequacy Aid if you increased your
 
04:43:16.110 --> 04:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
base adequacy a from 4,100 to 7,000 and
 
04:43:18.310 --> 04:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
you increase your swept it really
 
04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
depends on what percentage of the state
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
students do you have and what percentage
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the state's property do you have so
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you're kind of one to one if you had
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
a growth in base Aid and a growth in
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
swept it wouldn't really change much for
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
you um you would still get the same
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
state cash check you would normally get
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
um that's not how works for every single
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
Community um for some people their
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
growth in swept is going to be a lot
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
larger than their gross in Bas Aid um
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
and for some communities their growth in
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
Bas a is going to grow a lot quicker
 
04:43:46.750 --> 04:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
than they're swept so it is going to
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is going to change the formula of
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
course um and then of course the excess
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
swept component um some uh some
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
communities more communities as you
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
increase as you increase base Aid under
 
04:44:01.470 --> 04:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
current swept excess swept goes from 29
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
million down to 12 million uh base Aid
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
to the conv Val order but as you
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
increase XS we to you know 773 million
 
04:44:12.550 --> 04:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
even as you increase um base Aid uh to
 
04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
7, uh 356 EXs swept is now um estimated
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment question I can't imagine
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure how to ask um so
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
how do we get to
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
91 million excess
 
04:44:38.590 --> 04:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
web uh
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
scenario just to back up a little bit
 
04:44:45.150 --> 04:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
the conval order came down the conv Val
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
order came down and the Rand order came
 
04:44:49.230 --> 04:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
down and so if you don't touch
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
swept uh the state would need to find
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
400 $400 million to satisfy conal you
 
04:44:57.788 --> 04:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
could find $400 Million by finding
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue $400 million you could find $400
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
Million by cutting all the
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
non-constitutional parts of the formula
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
that would heard a lot of the targeted
 
04:45:07.708 --> 04:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
communities the other option you could
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
do is increase swept so increasing swept
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
to make it so you can afford um without
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know spending $400 million in new
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue um is kind of where if you like
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
if you depends on how much money you
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
have but if you don't have $400 million
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
increasing swept is a way to make
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy more
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
affordable so as a taxpayer M on my tax
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill yep I have that those little things
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
that say what I o what will I what will
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
it say so you're swept equalized rate
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
under this uh
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
formula um this is equalized so it's not
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily what you might see on
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
your tax bill but it's going to more
 
04:45:50.350 --> 04:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
than double so it's about a122 on an
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
equalized basis and it's going to go to
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
around a
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
$259 so you'll see your swept rate
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
increase which means you as a taxpayer
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
going to pay your swep taxes and that
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
those swep taxes um if you're not an
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
excess swep town 100% of those swep
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
taxes that you just paid to your tax
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
collector will go to your school
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
district so for some communities that's
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen but your but your
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
education tax line goes down okay
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
because the overall revenue is f is has
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
a cap on it
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the 7,3 the base the increase in the
 
04:46:29.520 --> 04:46:30.990 align:start position:0%
so the 7,3 the base the increase in the
base

04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
base
 
04:46:31.000 --> 04:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
base
7.3

04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
7.3
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
7.3
um

04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.628 --> 04:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
that will
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
come part of that will already be just
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
like it is now yeah yeah okay got it and
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
some of that some of that is funded
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
through yeah so for like Manchester
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester swept will increase as their
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
base increases now where Manchester
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
shakes out as far as they have a lot of
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
students so they're going to be getting
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of base eight increase but they're
 
04:47:00.030 --> 04:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of property so a lot of
 
04:47:00.040 --> 04:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of property so a lot of
swept

04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
increase Mr chair just again to uh
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
better understand this on First Site um
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
a town like Windham which obviously will
 
04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
become an excess swept Community right
 
04:47:19.390 --> 04:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
our assuming our education budget stays
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
the same because we will have a larger
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
portion of swept but instead of
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
everything coming back to the town part
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
of it will stay with the state that
 
04:47:31.948 --> 04:47:31.958 align:start position:0%
would mean that net our overall tax bill
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
has to increase if we keep the school
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
school budget exactly the same because
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
we would have to make up for the swept
 
04:47:42.190 --> 04:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
we are sending to the state by through a
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
smaller decrease in my local education
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
tax do I understand this your
 
04:47:48.030 --> 04:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct except your
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of Windam I think is might
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
be incorrect Windam I I don't think it's
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
an excess yeah I would be happy to be
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
wrong that's a good but the concern
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
remains for any other Town that's excess
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
swept and we are increasing them I mean
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
obviously I care about my town but I
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
also care about every other Town that's
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
in this situation so you know swap the
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
name with another yeah you're you're
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're correct so if your if your school
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
budget is a million dollar and you have
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
500k in local property taxes 250k in
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
adequacy state cash 250k in swept if I
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
increase your swept double it so now you
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
have 500k in swept money coming in 250k
 
04:48:28.430 --> 04:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
in adequacy cash then if you stay your
 
04:48:30.430 --> 04:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
budget the same then your local taxes
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
would go from 500k down to 250k so
 
04:48:36.190 --> 04:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
assuming you keep your school budget
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
flat and controlling for all of the
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
revenue sources that may or may not come
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
in so a lot of ifs there but um that's
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
how it would work now for the XS swep
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
Community um say the XS swep Community
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't get any adequacy cash and then
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
swept is doubled so for the EXs swept
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
Community say their budget is 1 million
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
say they're swept uh uh they're swept is
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh we say their swept is 500,000 and
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
their local education is 500,000 so they
 
04:49:05.070 --> 04:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
have a million dollar budget they have
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
500k local 500k all swept retained but
 
04:49:10.510 --> 04:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
now let's say they don't get to retain
 
04:49:12.030 --> 04:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
that swept anymore they have to remit
 
04:49:16.590 --> 04:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
some of that swept to the state um so um
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually this doesn't deal with doubling
 
04:49:19.628 --> 04:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
swept it gets way more complicated but
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
say they say they didn't have to retain
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
that swept let's let let me suggest that
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
you simplify and assume nothing else
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
changes we all know that's not going to
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
be the case but to just isolate this
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
impact totally so in this community in
 
04:49:33.788 --> 04:49:33.798 align:start position:0%
Windam if in a non-x swep community if
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
they control their if they keep their
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
District budget um flat basically every
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
swep dollar increase will turn into a
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
local a local dollar decrease but for
 
04:49:43.390 --> 04:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
NEX swep Community they will pay more in
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
taxes because what would happen was uh
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget 500k local 500k
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
swept now if they didn't get to retain
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
all of their swept and they had to give
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
250 over to the state that's 250 they
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are not sending to their
 
04:49:59.788 --> 04:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
school district therefore their school
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
district needs to increase their local
 
04:50:04.830 --> 04:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
taxes by 250 to fund their budget as it
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
currently exists so therefore um they're
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
still paying the full swept amount which
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
was 500k but now 250k less is going to
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
their school so therefore so that that's
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
how it works for an excess SW community
 
04:50:18.430 --> 04:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
and and assuming as a quick followup
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
very quick assuming totally
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
unrealistically that every town in the
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
state next year will have the same
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
education budget and this bill becomes
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
law seeing how sometimes we'll see
 
04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
property tax increases I'm assuming that
 
04:50:34.830 --> 04:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
if everybody kept their budget equal you
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
know unchange some towns will have to
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
see property tax decreases because they
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
get you know that money is going to the
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
state to be distributed to other towns
 
04:50:45.868 --> 04:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
you're right so there's 90 million in
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
excess swept that now comes into the
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
state and then is allocated throughout
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the formula we should expect
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
if nothing else changes which again
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
unrealistic that that 90 million will be
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
reflected in property ta tax drops in
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever communities are the receivers
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the additional yep but controlling
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
controlling for all those factors yes
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
assuming nothing changes at all just
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
you questions oh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
so um this excess swept that stays with
 
04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
the state now wasn't that usually used
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
to be called donut towns that's the
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
concept commonly referred to as donut
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
towns y so I mean you as soon as you
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
bring that up you generate opposition to
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
the bill but there's one other thing
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
though that if you're in a town that's
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
doing a revalu real estate
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
revaluation and they come in and all the
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
residential values have gone up three or
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
four times what happens to them that
 
04:51:46.590 --> 04:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so uh there's
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
two different property values there's
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
your assessed value that you keep that
 
04:51:52.750 --> 04:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
your community uh it's your Town's value
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
of your property and then there's the
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
state's value of your property and so
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
what the state does is they collect all
 
04:52:00.430 --> 04:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
of the assessment data that each Town
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
assessor sends in and they do something
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
called equalizing it so they look at
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
your property your town assessor and
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
they go is this town assessor not
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
assessing very often is this town not
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
keeping up with market value and for the
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
equalized version of your property
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
they'll give it a boost they sure did so
 
04:52:20.110 --> 04:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
so so they'll say this property is a lot
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
more a lot more valuable than say your
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
town has reported it um so for towns
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
that are really slow with assessing the
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
state will the state will talk about the
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
equalized value of that property trying
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to market value is going
 
04:52:33.750 --> 04:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
to be much higher so that's what what
 
04:52:36.030 --> 04:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
makes the tax Fair because everyone's on
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
a Level Playing Field in a sense that um
 
04:52:40.830 --> 04:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh the property values have been you've
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
controlled for different assessing
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
practices within different towns which
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely do
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
exist until you equalize it yeah wow
 
04:52:49.440 --> 04:52:52.910 align:start position:0%
exist until you equalize it yeah wow
thank

04:52:52.910 --> 04:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
yes just I want to put a concern out
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
there um I think we were on the floor we
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
passed two bills that we were very
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
excited about I think both sides
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is going to cause some
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
angst I just it's I it's in the room
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
already uh would it be better to have
 
04:53:24.030 --> 04:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
this be a
 
04:53:24.040 --> 04:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
this be a
separate

04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
something too late unless we uh put it
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
on another bill it's just what I'm what
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid of is I don't want to see
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
this go down because of this is my
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
concern that I mean I hear everybody's
 
04:53:43.080 --> 04:53:44.190 align:start position:0%
concern that I mean I hear everybody's
like

04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:53:48.270 --> 04:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
tents you know I'm all for the swept um
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I think I live in Manchester I mean
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have Kino we we spend lots people
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
spend lots of money in Manchester and we
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't get to keep it it goes up into
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
rooming meals it goes up whatever
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
wherever it goes to everybody else I get
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
it um and that's what swep was meant to
 
04:54:08.830 --> 04:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
do um but I don't know there are do we
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable and I'd have to ask
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
Rick and Dave how they feel about it do
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
we feel comfortable in putting this
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
amendment on the floor when the first
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing that they're going to do the same
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm seeing Kate with her
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
worried eyes
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be like a buzz across
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
the floor I mean we've heard it before
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think I think think that's
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
a good point Mr chair I think it would
 
04:54:37.868 --> 04:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
be nice to have a little more of the
 
04:54:40.030 --> 04:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
data analysis done under the amendment
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
to help give us as a subcommittee
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
reassurances you know that we be a
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
united front we're either for the
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
amendment or not and so that we send a
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
clear message to everyone else that yes
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment is different than the
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
original bill that we all were behind
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
but here's why it's good or here's why
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
good I have no problem we have three
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
bills three swept bills in
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
uh other swep bills if we took the swep
 
04:55:08.670 --> 04:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
bill out of
 
04:55:12.150 --> 04:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
this I would be happy I'm talking about
 
04:55:12.160 --> 04:55:13.110 align:start position:0%
this I would be happy I'm talking about
the

04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
excess the Rand decision if we if if we
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
if we took the Rand decision out of this
 
04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
and just did the conville with this I
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be happier but came when we
 
04:55:27.628 --> 04:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
discussed it with the Department of
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
Education their judgments are all
 
04:55:32.788 --> 04:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
wrapped in together so I would I will ha
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
I will have
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
modify this based on what ways and means
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
to us but we can't change the Rand
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
decision I mean that's that's why
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's hair's on fire right so I I
 
04:55:46.510 --> 04:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
am I'm concurring with you this could be
 
04:55:48.190 --> 04:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
a better Amendment without that and then
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
we fight that fight over here because
 
04:55:52.590 --> 04:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
we've already lost that
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
fight yeah go
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
ahead when we lost that fight we weren't
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
consistently doing re-evaluations every
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
5 years and I thought as a result of
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
losing that fight and people got to keep
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
their swept
 
04:56:18.430 --> 04:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
excess um by doing the fiveyear
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
reeval communities were doing this in an
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
equal methodology and Dr has a system
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
that they apply so that argument would
 
04:56:30.080 --> 04:56:31.430 align:start position:0%
that they apply so that argument would
become

04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
mute in terms of if the swep people set
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
excess swep people all of a sudden say
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm keeping my money I'm not giving it
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
up am I making any sense Jack but they
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
can't you see that's right I
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
right I'm I'll happily redraft this with
 
04:56:55.628 --> 04:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
the swept excess swept out of it but I
 
04:56:57.430 --> 04:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't but I'd like to hear from Rick and
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah representative Heath I'm not
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
sure if I follow the history with the I
 
04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
know that we do a 5-year evaluation if
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
you're talking about swear uh uh
 
04:57:15.310 --> 04:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
fairness in the property values um I I
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
think there has been litigation and
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
course core cases relative to that I'm
 
04:57:20.590 --> 04:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
just not fully up to speed on that um
 
04:57:21.830 --> 04:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not either I only know the ran
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
litigation which is um the the order we
 
04:57:26.350 --> 04:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
just got down which did not did not deal
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
process okay knowing that we are knowing
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to re reconvene on this
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything they'd like
 
04:57:36.840 --> 04:57:38.430 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything they'd like
to

04:57:38.430 --> 04:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
add can we hear it from Rick and and
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
David just I'm just I'm just commenting
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to reconvene I mean we're
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
not voting on this do you does anybody
 
04:57:52.470 --> 04:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
from education want to make
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:02.120 --> 04:58:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
mic

04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.070 --> 04:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
move it around the table just to try to
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
help better Define what transpired in
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
policy okay uh so you can get a grasp on
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
where the money has been added to the
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
current formula in what places so as
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
soon as everybody has
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
that then we can look at that and and
 
04:58:37.628 --> 04:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
and and discuss it and there's a lot of
 
04:58:40.350 --> 04:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
moving Parts in all this and and seeing
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
this other one right
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
here a lot more moving parts so you
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see this before I saw that
 
04:58:46.920 --> 04:58:47.868 align:start position:0%
didn't see this before I saw that
earlier

04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:58:51.150 --> 04:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
today but the issue is I think that we
 
04:58:52.750 --> 04:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
have three bills sitting over there in
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
ways means right now which are dealing
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
with swep that's why we tabled one Bild
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
the other day seeing that and I spoke to
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
it on the floor we have three over there
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
let see what's going to come out of ways
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
and means but taking this sheet right
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
here the one you I just passed
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
out there's several columns there and
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
where you see the X's is where we made
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
some changes in the given year for
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
example effective July 1
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
2024 we made changes for the relief
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
Grant the fiscal capacity disparity Aid
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
and going down into 1656 we made changes
 
04:59:38.430 --> 04:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
reference to the uh differentiated Aid
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
with the weighted values let's talk
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
about the the areas where we changed on
 
04:59:44.910 --> 04:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
the right hand and you can see what we
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
did we added
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
into effective July 1 20125 that's where
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
we changed the base from base cost from
 
04:59:56.548 --> 04:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
where we are now what's it's at
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
4,186 something thereabouts and we we
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
jumped it by $220 $22 per pupil to
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
$444 if you look at the second sheet
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to the front the second
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
sheet shows you how we did that we did
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
it in conjunction the way it's been done
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
for a decade going back to 2008 we
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
looked at the esbr report we looked at
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
what we did in 20171 18 and we modified
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
that we went and found out what is the
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
minimum average teacher cost in this
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
state today the average minimum teacher
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
42,5 you can go to some towns where it's
 
05:00:44.470 --> 05:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
over 50,000 55,000 go to some others and
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's down as low as
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
32,000 so we took that average and then
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
we use the same factors for increasing
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
it for benefits and for um the the uh
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
relationship whether they're in an
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
elementary K through three we changed it
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
to K through three instead of K through
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
two so the ratio in K through 2 used to
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
be 1 to 25 students that's what we're
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
funding at the pupil teacher ratio we
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
felt that K through three are line
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
closer and four through 60 intermediate
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
grades Middle School grades going up
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's all at the 1 to30 level you can
 
05:01:24.548 --> 05:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
see on this back side of that sheet we
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
did it for the administr for the
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
principal we went and found the average
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
cost of a principal in the state today
 
05:01:34.590 --> 05:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 Plus
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
103.3 the other categories were
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
increased equivalently to how we
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
increased teachers and principles based
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
upon the same percentage and and with
 
05:01:45.310 --> 05:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
the other items on the backside which
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
deal with instructional materials and
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
teacher professional development all
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
those areas from back in 2008 now been
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
increased by about
 
05:01:57.548 --> 05:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
16% so you can see that if you're in
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
that on those two columns on the right
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
hand side on the back page there you can
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
see that it's one for per pupil K
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
through three and then per pupil 4
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
through 12 the cost per pupil would be $
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
44700 for K through3 and for 4 through
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
12 which is really contrary to a lot of
 
05:02:17.708 --> 05:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
people think it's more expensive in on
 
05:02:18.990 --> 05:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
the high school but it ain't because
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
they can put more kids in Block classes
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
and and PE Etc it's 4265 the universal
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
cost which we've used remember we
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
started out years ago at
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
$3,456 that was based on the on the EST
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
report it'd be
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
4404 so that's what we used to calculate
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
the our formula when we were going back
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
to the front page for the FY 26 column
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
we kept the other column at the what we
 
05:02:50.430 --> 05:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
would be projecting according to our
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
current Formula you can see going down
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
in both of those columns we jumped it by
 
05:02:58.510 --> 05:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
$25 million that's the relief Grant
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
that's on the right side right of hold
 
05:03:01.878 --> 05:03:03.750 align:start position:0%
that's on the right side right of hold
harmless

05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it's going to be allocated out
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
based upon free and reduced meals
 
05:03:10.670 --> 05:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
starting at 12% and going up to
 
05:03:14.350 --> 05:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
48% we had something like that back in
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
2008 when we were looking at um fiscal
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity 8 the fiscal capacity
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid that we have here however
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
is based upon the equalized valuation
 
05:03:28.708 --> 05:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
per P per per admr and it goes from and
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
and and Dave worked on this one uh goes
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
from nine uh it starts at
 
05:03:39.390 --> 05:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
$800,000 goes up to $1.9 th000 that's
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
what we basically been using for Ed
 
05:03:44.350 --> 05:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
education relief grants right now and so
 
05:03:46.270 --> 05:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
you can see how that's allocated the Max
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
Grant is $900 so that came out to $39
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
million adding on and of course you can
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
see what we did with special ed you'll
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
get the 1656 when your boss here is
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
ready to go that direction but you can
 
05:04:02.590 --> 05:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
calculate where we were for FY 26 you
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
you can add the 35 the 25 and the 39 you
 
05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
come up to roughly around $99
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
million and and then and you can see
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we had for FY 25 it started up to
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
add 25 the 39 and um you would add in
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that well later the the special yeah no
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's the addition of the base that case
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes it's the it's the base which adds up
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the FY 26 from fy2 that's what we
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is we wanted to go back and
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
look at the original formula and look at
 
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
those inputs make sure we're adjusting
 
05:04:40.548 --> 05:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
them to where we are
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
today and then on the special ed if you
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
want me to briefly explain that
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative you're not there yet what
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is is suspend this
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
conversation on
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
1583 and open the discussion on
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
1656 because we can vote that one yes
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
we're not going to vote this one today
 
05:05:07.628 --> 05:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
1656 so so you're in 1656 right now now
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
I'm in 1656 I'll briefly explain it and
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
Dave might want to add in some things we
 
05:05:20.590 --> 05:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
passed several bills of L several last
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
years where we're recognizing for those
 
05:05:25.470 --> 05:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
13 IEP
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
categories one amount of money doesn't
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
really meet those categories which are
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
higher cost categories like traumatic
 
05:05:38.110 --> 05:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
brain injury orthopedically handicap and
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's 13 of them everything
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
from developmentally delayed to
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities I see Rebecca here um she
 
05:05:48.430 --> 05:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
could explain the various categories I
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
could too but I I think we're moving
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
quickly here what we did is we then
 
05:05:53.948 --> 05:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
asked how many kids do we have in
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
special ed under differentiated Aid and
 
05:06:00.070 --> 05:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
you can see on the last sheet third
 
05:06:00.080 --> 05:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
you can see on the last sheet third
sheet

05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
05:06:01.400 --> 05:06:04.110 align:start position:0%
sheet
down

05:06:04.110 --> 05:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:06:06.548 --> 05:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
the figures
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
which Caitlyn uses over at doe show more
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
figures in special ed than we would see
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
out of the report out of the special ed
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
folks they use a one-time shot where he
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
takes an average shot so the average
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
shot is
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
3,965 kids we're projecting for the
 
05:06:27.390 --> 05:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
years that we're dealing with here in
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
this budget and of that we see we broke
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
down these categories and con Junction
 
05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
with how school districts are reporting
 
05:06:37.750 --> 05:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
back to doe and doe to the federal
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
government regarding the individual
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
disability educations act there's a an
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
area where we have to report based upon
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
these three categories uh 80% or more
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the time spent in special education less
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
79% down and actually she goes 79 to 40%
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
less than that down we went 79% down and
 
05:07:02.830 --> 05:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's category B and then the
 
05:07:04.750 --> 05:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh the last category is our
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
homeschooling kids and and or those in
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or those are not
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling but uh
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
homebased hospital or residential 619
 
05:07:20.670 --> 05:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
kids and we waited that more seeing that
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
is a much Co more costly program so we
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
rided it wait weighted it according to
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
the first category is weighted at a
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
6 of the base 1.2 is the second category
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
and 1.8 is the third base so you can see
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
what those costs come out to be when
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
you're using that
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
444 it comes out to $2600 $5,200
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
$7,900 for those three
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
categories this does not take into
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
account anything to do with catastrophic
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Aid that $33 million or so that you have
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
to have available for when you get into
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.830 --> 05:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
children question um just with regard to
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
Charter children children charter
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
schools with disabilities The Local
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
School District covers the cost of um
 
05:08:21.070 --> 05:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
our Charter kids ascending school yes
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
right so how res resident school so will
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
we apply the same formula to the
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
children in charter schools and that
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
money then I'm presuming will come back
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
to the local school district yes thank
 
05:08:33.638 --> 05:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
to the local school district yes thank
you

05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely other
 
05:08:38.320 --> 05:08:40.708 align:start position:0%
absolutely other
questions

05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
1656 the number that was that I pulled
 
05:08:56.070 --> 05:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
million you're and but this is this is
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
looking like $101
 
05:09:03.548 --> 05:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
million somewhere between cup and lift
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
something didn't make
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
no that's the total that's the total
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
about okay so I'm not crazy the
 
05:09:26.910 --> 05:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
current the current amount is $66
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
million we're spending right now by
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
doing the changes here you would would
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
add on that additional dollars to get to
 
05:09:37.150 --> 05:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
that 101 million so you're you're
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
increasing it by a total of $40 million
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
give well you're increasing it by uh $
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
34.3 million okay that's I mean
 
05:09:51.868 --> 05:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
represent doesn't have we have detailed
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
level data and we we work
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
with level data with the student with a
 
05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
disability and U linked it up with the
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual student we have different
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
number so we spend more time going over
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent a glads methodology but we
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
just have a different number
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
so different then I guess we're not
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this one today either
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
because also we need more time because
 
05:10:19.150 --> 05:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
this is we like to provide language to
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
change this because there's going to be
 
05:10:22.868 --> 05:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
a lag in the way we get the data from
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
the sped Bureau so we probably need to
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a two-year lag in the SP data if we
 
05:10:30.030 --> 05:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
were to implement this bill which
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
so all right so this one goes on the
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
Shelf till our next meeting as well good
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
all right does anybody have any comments
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
they like to make about this
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
1656 question we got the we got all the
 
05:10:54.030 --> 05:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
talent here I just wanted to say that I
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
followed along with the subcommittee's
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
discussions about special ed and
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
differentiating the aid into three
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
different categories and I just wanted
 
05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
to thank the committee for doing that
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
work I think um it's probably long
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
overdue and um I know that there will be
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
communities across our state who will
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate this move if we do end up
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking that way thank
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
you I also sat in you know list or on
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
Zoom zoomed into it um and really
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
support and appreciate the work that
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
they did with this I mean I think it's
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's long overdue and I'm frustrated to
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
hear that there's such a lag before we
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
can actually start to implement
 
05:11:30.958 --> 05:11:32.750 align:start position:0%
can actually start to implement
it

05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
that was the first time we've been able
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
to put a committee together with people
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
from Ways and Means finance and policy
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
and that I think we I really appreciate
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
your W willingness to let us use this
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
room representa Emer and representative
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
Heath um I I think it re really got us
 
05:11:50.590 --> 05:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
to where we wanted to get quicker when
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
we had the three groups working
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
together can I add sure um that's I
 
05:11:58.230 --> 05:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
think I want to Echo um representative
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
Heath's concern too is that it was
 
05:12:02.190 --> 05:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
remarkable to see the bipartisan ship
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
and everyone working together to pull
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
together is it what 586
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
583 and so I don't want to lose that
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
although there's so much I like about
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
the Emer Amendment um I'm hoping we'll
 
05:12:16.110 --> 05:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
have time to merge these together but I
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
would like that subcommittee to weigh in
 
05:12:20.230 --> 05:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
on how we can pull this together as to
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
one thing because I very much appreciate
 
05:12:23.470 --> 05:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
what you did and watching the
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship in that subcommittee was
 
05:12:29.548 --> 05:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
remarkable okay do you want to make any
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
other comments about either one of these
 
05:12:31.080 --> 05:12:32.590 align:start position:0%
other comments about either one of these
bills

05:12:32.590 --> 05:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
no that we've been working for years on
 
05:12:34.958 --> 05:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
no that we've been working for years on
weighted

05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
weighted
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
formula for special education and it's
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
well over 39 states to have a weighted
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
formula they're just recognizing there's
 
05:12:45.310 --> 05:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
so many different needs for the various
 
05:12:48.510 --> 05:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
categories and using what we used with
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
it we do have data available we
 
05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
initially tried to do it by individual
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
categories but then students according
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the director here are times sometimes
 
05:12:59.948 --> 05:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
overlapping between categories and they
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
may have multiple handicap how do you do
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
that this way we've got the information
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
this okay so yes I think Bri Bri Wasing
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
on this I think there's maybe some we
 
05:13:21.310 --> 05:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
might have two different data sets
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
represent so that could be the
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
discrepancy figure out why the numbers
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
are 11656 but but somebody commented
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that it needed this 1656 needed an
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
amendment needs probably some Amendment
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
on when we deter when we collect this B
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
data there's a discrepancy between when
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
they collect it and when we use it for
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
so you're going to help me put that
 
05:13:43.878 --> 05:13:46.150 align:start position:0%
so you're going to help me put that
together

05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:13:49.708 --> 05:13:49.718 align:start position:0%
okay yes it's taking
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
us away from leg to get away from the
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
three-year leg I I'd hate to kind of go
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
back to a two-year lag yeah so the the
 
05:14:01.390 --> 05:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
issue with the lag is the more we lag
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
the more accurate the data is I know but
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
also the less current it is so it's kind
 
05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
of a tradeoff
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
much all right does anybody want to have
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
1583 I let not speak now or forever hold
 
05:14:23.548 --> 05:14:23.558 align:start position:0%
your peace because we're going to
 
05:14:25.548 --> 05:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
reconvene on this
 
05:14:27.788 --> 05:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
PE I just want to say it's very exciting
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
to get to that number of the 7.3 I
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
didn't think we could get there
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
well it takes Finance man we don't know
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
anything at
 
05:14:40.548 --> 05:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
all by all means yeah thank you Mr chair
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
what do you see as a work path for um
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
for 1583 and 1656 going
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
forward what do I what do you see is a
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
work path for both these we right now we

we're not going to have a meeting next
 
05:14:56.670 --> 05:14:56.680 align:start position:0%

05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
weet and that would be work sessions yes
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%

05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
executing be work sessions
 
05:15:26.430 --> 05:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay we'll shoot for that date but if we
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
have if we have session then it's right
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
have to do it next week right
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
we just need to coordinate
 
05:15:38.110 --> 05:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
well yeah we're running out of time here
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
that um those the 20th
 
05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
is isn't it the 20th you have to have
 
05:15:47.788 --> 05:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
all your committee reports done by noon
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
because the 21st is the date they're
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be submitted but I can't
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
imagine going much later than that Well
 
05:15:54.910 --> 05:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
Finance does strange things do you have
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
April Alo so that's for that that was
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
for second committee bills okay that
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
gives us a little yeah we have a little
 
05:16:17.280 --> 05:16:18.910 align:start position:0%
gives us a little yeah we have a little
longer

05:16:18.910 --> 05:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
longer
 
05:16:18.920 --> 05:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
longer
yeah

05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.070 --> 05:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
good well as we're going to do it as
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
soon as we can but you know but what
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
right yes and just as an aside we're all
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
holding that day for house session so if
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's not house it can be here yes um I
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
guess I'd like to ask um
 
05:17:04.350 --> 05:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of stakeholders Beyond
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
division two of finance that are
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this um you know some of
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
them are here but to make sure that
 
05:17:10.868 --> 05:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders are also involved to
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
bring in their knowledge of um basically
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know the education and the formula
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits but um just to make sure
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
that we have stakeholders that can
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
answer the questions that will be here
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
um I was sort of envisioning um an
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
equitable kind of group of people
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
that're working on this as opposed to
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know a hearing sort of a thing
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
although I guess that's basically what a
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah before we go to full committee I
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us would like to
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
understand better how these two things
 
05:17:40.628 --> 05:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
will work together since we have to
 
05:17:42.910 --> 05:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
present that to the full committee and
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
to have that stakeholder input I think
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
is really important as opposed to us
 
05:17:48.750 --> 05:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
sort of talking about it when we know
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
there are people who know way more than
 
05:17:51.910 --> 05:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
some of us know well we'll have we'll
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
have to notice the meeting anyway so
 
05:17:58.350 --> 05:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
though Mr chair I just wanted to ask if
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
we could get clarification on one
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
particular data point point for the next
 
05:18:05.270 --> 05:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
work session on
 
05:18:08.190 --> 05:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
1583 could we could we just find out
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%

05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
