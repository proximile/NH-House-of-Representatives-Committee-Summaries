00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.949 align:start position:0%
meeting again hb 1644.
uh

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
before we get into things i just want to
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
introduce the members of the
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which is
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
representative um nick white
 
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative jeannine notter
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative partial is a member of
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee member who apparently just
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
walked in
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
and myself we
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
these are the voting members of the
 
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
these are the voting members of the
subcommittee

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative mcgee do you
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
no no you're certainly welcome to be
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
here you can take your name plate away
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
so we don't confuse you with a
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee member but you're welcome
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
to stay here and we may even ask
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
excuse me okay
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
um let's um
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
get down to business here um obviously
 
00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
we're here to discuss
 
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
we're here to discuss
1644.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
1644.
 
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
1644.
um

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know there are various options we
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
can do we get otp at otpa we could
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
vote for interim study we could vote
 
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
ietl it and we could also put an
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
amendment in all those options
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
uh are on the table
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
but i would suggest that
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
only one or two of them would really be
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
an option at this time
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
of a practical nature
 
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
of a practical nature
representative

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.550 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
representative

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i've been doing a lot of
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
research over the weekend
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
the more i read the more confused i get
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
including with what we have done
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
in the past which was deep
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
we kind of direct
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
we kind of um
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
deregulated the telecommunications
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
industry and gave up our control of it
 
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
industry and gave up our control of it
and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
i wondered
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
where that this bill fits with state
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
regulations since
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i i
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe we have that control over
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this as well i was going to get into
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
that at a slightly uh different time
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh i was going to suggest that maybe we
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
should have a
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
short brief um
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
scientific uh briefing from
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative white on wavelength or
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
something i i asked you to look into
 
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
something i i asked you to look into
some

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
just for the general knowledge of
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
everybody what are we talking about in
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
terms of 5g wavelengths and where they
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
fall into the spectrum
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and how they're how they affect your
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
dawn effect
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
i wish you would have sent me something
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
in writing because i completely forgot
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
um but representative knotter's uh
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
sheets here are actually pretty good
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
summary of everything in terms of
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
frequency what what types of technology
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
are on what frequency the power levels
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
um so if there's any specific questions
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
we can definitely dive into those if
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
anyone has anything um
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative nader would you like
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to your briefing
 
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.670 align:start position:0%
to talk to your briefing
sure

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
the technology part of this committee it
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come easy to me so in order for
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
me to learn i have to write things out
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
so i started out with this
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
just so i could have a visual like what
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
it all means i uh
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
spent a long time on the phone and
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
communication with the scientists to
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
help me to explain everything
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
and then i took all of that and i
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
figured out that in our legislative
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
email account we have
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to create a powerpoint which
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
i've never used before so this this was
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
my first one so if it's not perfect i
 
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.430 align:start position:0%
my first one so if it's not perfect i
apologize

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
the title page is 5g
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
what is it what is it it's an encoding
 
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.469 align:start position:0%
what is it what is it it's an encoding
technology

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
not a frequency nor the power of the
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
broadcast the thing being broadcast
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the problem
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
the voice versus data makes no
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
difference to the risk of the given
 
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
difference to the risk of the given
signal

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
signal
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you turn the page
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
we have 600
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
megahertz to 900 megahertz
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
and this is low band
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
frequency used by all cellular
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
communications since the 19 early 1970s
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's where the channels 14 through 71
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
for tv reside
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
base frequency of all cell phone
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
companies it goes over mountains and
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
hills it goes through objects like walls
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
the old bag cell phones could broadcast
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
at 5 watts the new hand
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
held cells at one watt
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
tv stations broadcast at 50 000 watts so
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to get more radiation
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
driving past the wmur tower
 
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
driving past the wmur tower
than

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
holding a cell phone to your head for a
 
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
holding a cell phone to your head for a
year

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
therefore more damaging
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you block 5g in this frequency you
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
block all cell phones in most tv
 
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
block all cell phones in most tv
stations

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
you turn the page to 1700 megahertz to
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
2.6 gigahertz this is mid band
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
in this frequency cell phones broadcast
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
at .04 watts
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
towers at no more than 5 watts
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
wi-fi is 2.4 gigahertz a microwave oven
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
is 2.4 gigahertz now this has been used
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
mid-band since 1992 with 2g
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's currently used in cities without
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
these frequencies cell service doesn't
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
work in cities low band doesn't have
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
enough bandwidth megahertz to handle all
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the users
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
it goes through walls and through
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
buildings but at half to a third as well
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
as low band
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
2.4 gigahertz again that's your
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
microwave oven standing in front of it
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
defrosting a chicken you're getting more
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
radiation than weeks of using your cell
 
00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.430 align:start position:0%
radiation than weeks of using your cell
phone

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
using these frequencies for cell service
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
instead of cable and satellite equals
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
less radiation received
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
before the fcc converted it to cell
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
phone use
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
2.5 gigahertz used to be used for
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
satellites 150 000 watts in frequency
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
17 to 19 1700 to 1900 megahertz was used
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
by the military and scientists
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
gps is 2.3 gigahertz
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
so now we turn the page right 3.2
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
gigahertz to 3.8 gigahertz this is
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
microwave it's currently being set up by
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
verizon and a tnt
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
this is what interferes with the planes
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
since sputnik use c-band satellites
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
broadcasting 150 000 watts to over 500
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
000 watts by soviets
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
parts also used by cable and regular
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
phone companies to broadcast between
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
distant towers before affordable fiber
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
cable tv
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
that was converted to digital in the
 
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.310 align:start position:0%
that was converted to digital in the
1990s

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
1990s
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
so the six foot
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
plus dish dishes you know that people
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
used to have in their front yards
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
were in this band at a hundred thousand
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
times higher power than self phone
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
services the same power as 2.5 gigahertz
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
and above
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
the issue for planes is a loom they're
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
aluminum with miles of thin wire so that
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
makes the plane a massive antenna plus
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
interactions between low power so ac at
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
60 hertz get
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
gigahertz megahertz sorry in wires and
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
planes so the human body is not made of
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
aluminum and we're not an antenna and
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
our wires our nerves are much better
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
insulated than plane we do not oscillate
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
at 60 hertz
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
it goes through walls poorly it does not
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
go over hills
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's affected by trees so even the
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
leaves on the trees will affect it it
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
works well in cities to add speed speed
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
but can't stand alone
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
so now we turn the page and we're at
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
five gigahertz to seven gigahertz this
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
is wi-fi we're using it now if you have
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
wi-fi same power that cell phone company
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
used for mid bands and microwave it does
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
not go through walls this is why it
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
drops going from room to room which
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
happens to me all the time
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
wi-fi has dfs sections it requires wi-fi
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
access point to listen for radar signals
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
and turn it off and not use those
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
frequencies if they hear anything why
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
because ground radar uses these
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
frequencies for tracking planes it's
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting very dramatic now if you hear
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the cell phone over here at 100 000
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
watts of power
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
200 000 times more powerful than what
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
you are exposed to with wi-fi
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
so now we turn the page and we have 12
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
to 60 gigahertz
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
mm wave this is the one people say make
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
them sick it has a higher frequency
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
all satellite weather mapping is done in
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
18 gigahertz
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
100 to 200 000 watts of power constantly
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
overhead broadcasting down on us
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
the space station is 12 gigahertz
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
broadcasting down on us the military
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
uses this frequency the frequency is so
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
high that even glass will weaken the
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
signal making it all but useless in a
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
used they use this in outdoor stadiums
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
it does not go through walls so the
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
walls at your house block it
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
we turn the page at 78 gigahertz this is
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
your car's collision avoidance system
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
emergency braking et cetera
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
frequency at similar power levels to
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
cell service but constantly you are
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
being subjected to it constantly every
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
time you drive an older vehicle
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
now we turn the page we have three
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
thousand gigahertz to seven hundred and
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand gigahertz visible light
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
and ultraviolet light
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
visible light is three thousand
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
gigahertz to seven thousand six hundred
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
fifty gigahertz it's 400 to 1000 times
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
higher frequency than your car let alone
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
cell service
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet light is 30
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
petaherds which i've never heard of
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
before to 790
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
terahertz again i've never heard of that
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
or 790 000 gigahertz this is where
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation begins all cell
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
phones and other broadcasts are
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
frequencies below visible light vastly
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
less powerful powerful vastly less
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
frequency than light from the sun
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
visible light can't cause dna or other
 
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
visible light can't cause dna or other
ionization

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
ionization
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
no evidence that anything below visible
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
light can do anything other than warming
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
the skin so when i hold the cell phone
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
to my ear it my head gets hot and it
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
bothers me
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
low voltage versus high voltage low
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
voltage electricity is safe to touch so
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's like if you put your tongue on
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
the nine volt battery whereas high
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
voltage like grabbing a power line will
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
kill you
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
so the next page talks about ionization
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
process of electromagnetic waves being
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
so energetic it can actually break off
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
electrons and atoms
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
from atoms and cause
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
charges to accumulate on the particles
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that cause them to have energy absorbed
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't otherwise and then
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
split them apart
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
split apart the molecules that make up
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
the dna which is protein chains
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
to induce ionizing radiation you have to
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
have both high frequency and high high
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
power that's with really fast wave
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
and above visible light and it has to be
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
relatively high power levels
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
none of the frequencies used for cell
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
phones have either the power nor the
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
freak high frequencies required to do
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
this as confirmed by countless studies
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
done for over 100 years
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
on the last page i just had some end
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
notes the higher the frequency the less
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
they penetrate walls and go over hills
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
every doubling of frequency effectively
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
halves the ability to penetrate walls
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
and go over hills at the same wattage
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
5g poses no more risk than the current
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
use for 4g and vastly less risk such as
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
there is any than when it was being used
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
for military and tv purposes
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for a
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive short term
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
schooling on frequencies
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i did have some more notes that didn't
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
5g is carried by radio waves transmitted
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
between antenna
 
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.670 align:start position:0%
between antenna
or

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
or mast and your phone the waves travel
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
shorter distances through urban spaces
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
so it requires more transmitter mass
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
than previous technology closer to the
 
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
than previous technology closer to the
ground

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
radio waves their non-ionizing lacks
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient energy to break apart dna and
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
cause cellular damage
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
higher up the electromagnetic spectrum
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
well beyond cell phone frequencies clear
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
health risks from extended exposure the
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
sun could give you skin cancer x-rays
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
and gamma rays i didn't have anything
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
with that 5g uses more transmitters it
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
runs at lower power levels than 4g so it
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
equals lower level of radiation
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
part of the 5g spectrum falls under
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
microwave band generates heat and
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
objects through which they pass
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
maximum radio frequency level is so
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
small no temperature rise has been
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
observed to date and that's from
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
professor radney
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
rodney croft the advisor to the
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
international commission on non-ionizing
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
does anyone on this subcommittee have
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
does anyone at this point i'd like to uh
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
open to our visitors to see if they have
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
any uh more to add in that information
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
we'll get the points in a minute i just
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that what was briefed
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
is understood by all and is i'm sure
 
00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.629 align:start position:0%
is understood by all and is i'm sure
it's

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
accurate but is there anything else that
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
they could add to it uh one minute
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
please representative kelly pitts you
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
well you're talking about adding to the
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
to the presentation and i made some uh
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
notes as i was going along
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
on the presentation so you want well a
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
couple of open discussion
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that i
 
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:38.230 align:start position:0%
made notes on is that
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
made notes on is that
[Music]

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you block the 5g you block all cell
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
phones and most tv stations
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
and in my re my
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
research i found that not to be true
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
that some of the older cell phones will
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
not work and that that's something that
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that people would have to uh
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
check to see what kind of you know how
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
many gigahertz your phone works on i'd
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
be darned if i could find out what my
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
phone works on probably
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
hot air
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
but it that that did not seem to be
 
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.789 align:start position:0%
but it that that did not seem to be
correct

00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
information that i had
 
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
information that i had
gleaned

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
gleaned
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing as or and has been
 
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.230 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing as or and has been
studied

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
as radiation sensitivity and i remember
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the studies that came out
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
that caution people about holding the
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
cell phones too close to your head
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
and this is going on a 4g and 3g
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
because there was a cola
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
coalition between cell phones uh people
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
who constantly use a cell phone and
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
brain tumors and that was a study that
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
was ongoing
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that they're still
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing even though it's being rolled
 
00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.029 align:start position:0%
ongoing even though it's being rolled
out

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
out
um

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
um
about

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
the human body not being an antenna i
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't know when i was a kid it was hold
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
the rabbit he is and we get reception
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we can get it so i think the human
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
body certainly is a conductor of
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
electricity and has can can do that and
 
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
electricity and has can can do that and
i

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
was used as an antenna as a child
 
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
was used as an antenna as a child
um

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other things uh
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
you were subject to constantly every
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
time you drove there's radiation all
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
around us we know that
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
we we our own friendly sun has radiation
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and yes the sun will burn you
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
but then there are
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
effects that that some people have not
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
all people that are sensitive
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
that can be gleaned from just the normal
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
everyday radiation and one of the
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
factors in radiation in general is radon
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we're told to test
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's recommended that when
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
you buy a house you check it for radon
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
and also you will
 
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
and also you will
so

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's so many things in my mind here
 
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.789 align:start position:0%
there's so many things in my mind here
that

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
added to
what

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the other one was the distance from
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
the source now we talked about the space
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
station the distance from the store
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
source makes the effects less
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm certainly not reaching out to the
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
space station
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
or trying to touch it i can't even
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
so those are the things that i found
 
00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.710 align:start position:0%
so those are the things that i found
interesting

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
interesting
uh

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
and so and there are implications
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and there are studies
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
and what i found is that some of this is
 
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.070 align:start position:0%
and what i found is that some of this is
not

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent because none of the
 
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.669 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent because none of the
scientists

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
with the information so that's my little
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
bit thank you
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and i would
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
agree um
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unsettledness in this
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
technology right now
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably for some time to come i would
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i think it's important that we as a
 
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.070 align:start position:0%
um i think it's important that we as a
subcommittee

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
understand the background and the
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me the wide variety of the
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
radiation that's around us
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
i believe for the purpose of this
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill um i think what we're focusing on
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
or what we should focus on is not so
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
much whether you can hold your phone to
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
your ear or not up it's the
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh any uh frequencies coming from the
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
actual towers
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh that are providing this medium uh to
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
whatever instruments has to choose 5g so
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
while i think it's very important that
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
we do understand this background
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation representative
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
dodder questions representative kelly
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
pitts um we need to understand all that
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
background so we can go forward and look
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
at the real specificness of tower and
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
how it could be interfering before i
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
go on to another question
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
is my understanding reading
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
i went to the frequently asked questions
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the fcc online provided very good
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
information is my understanding though
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
presentation that uh
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
the technology of 5g uh the five seven
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
to five nine gigahertz i understand is
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
uh becomes uh ineffective after a
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
thousand feet
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
is what i i heard was being briefed by
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the by the ctia so anything beyond a
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
thousand feet would i'm assuming would
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
render the 5g technology useless for for
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
what they have to use it for so that's
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
just what i read there
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
sarge uh i'm not gonna demote you to
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh so much
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative thomas um and thank you
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
for the paper you said along um
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
from the european uh i i don't hack it
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
under the uh
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's a long acronym it is it is and i'm
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
horrible with acronyms i see too many
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
letters here yeah which warns me that my
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
very own
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
pride and joy in my kitchen my induction
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
cooktop is something that i should be
 
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.230 align:start position:0%
cooktop is something that i should be
avoiding

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
avoiding
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
um the difference there is i take that
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
risk on
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
and uh what we're talking about here is
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're imposing a risk on the broad
 
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
we're imposing a risk on the broad
public

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
and my other question and this is
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that i've had in my back my
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
mind since this bill was first
 
00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
mind since this bill was first
introduced

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
if this technology is indeed
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
questionable enough
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially dangerous enough to
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
require setbacks
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
then why are we employing it at all when
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
we know that we have a job only half
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
done with 4g technology we have very
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
many dead spots in our in our state is
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
is always irritating to discover
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that with limitations of 5g
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that's unfulfilled promise
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
we may be more wiser to this put the
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing on the back burner and
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
focus on 4g technology and continue that
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
the finishing that task
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
however i also do understand that we do
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have to seat a certain amount of
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
authority to the fcc
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
and lastly i'm still i'm going on her to
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
please forgive me
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
i know the fcc does uh
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
tend to carry a lot of um
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
well i don't know how to say this uh the
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
chairs of the fcc are recruited from
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists rather than scientific
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
community and i gotta say that i i am
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about that i'm concerned that
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
we are maybe are not getting the best
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we really require to make
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
such a decision i feel undereducated i
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
will say
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time well thank
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
you representative um i i will say that
 
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.390 align:start position:0%
you representative um i i will say that
um

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
in ref uh uh it's i think you were
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
referring to the international
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
commission of on non-ionizing radiation
 
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.430 align:start position:0%
commission of on non-ionizing radiation
protection

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
protection
they

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
their international body and my
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
the u.s does look at them for
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
specifications as well my understanding
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
reading some of the literature here
 
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.830 align:start position:0%
reading some of the literature here
that

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
that
we

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
we even go beyond what they recommend
 
00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
we even go beyond what they recommend
for

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
the specs i'll just i'll put it simply
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
they talk in terms of you know
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
power and amplifi amplitude and amperes
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
and and so forth but um i i will state
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
that just about everybody
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh be it uh
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
who or or this body here or other uh
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
health organizations
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
they classified just about everything in
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
terms of what kind of a carcinogenic
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
effect it would have on people
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
and i uh according to what i read
 
00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
and i uh according to what i read
the

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
world health organization classifies um
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
this uh frequency this this technology
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
as a class 2b carcinogen or however you
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
pronounce it correctly yeah great now
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
that may
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
worry some people but i discovered that
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
many things are classified whether
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're low or high and this is
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
considered low level in fact the use of
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
talcum powder is put into the same
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
category as 2b
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
so it you know it and i believe that's
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
because no one can ever prove
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
conclusively that it does or doesn't but
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
evidence supports
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
low level and possible
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
so what's the risk factor low versus
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
high i think that's why they have it in
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
in that category although i do recognize
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
that you know some people do
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
they do have effects from this i mean
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it you know
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
people have effects
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh people have i know don't compare this
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
to allergens but in a similar way you
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
can be more sensitive to one allergy
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
versus another and it's
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
hell for some people i understand that
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
um that's that's my thing anyway uh
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
i'll say tele
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
talcum powder the jury's out the the
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
awards have been made
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i i want to just say that there was
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
another issue
 
00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
another issue
that

00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
as far as rolling out 5g i couldn't get
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
an answer as to whether the money coming
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
from the federal government would be
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
roll out 5g
 
00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.190 align:start position:0%
roll out 5g
exclusively

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the other was the companies behind
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
it now i know at t verizon they have
 
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
it now i know at t verizon they have
their

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
moniker on it
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
but who's the company behind it and
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
there was some question about one of the
 
00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.789 align:start position:0%
there was some question about one of the
companies

00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
rolling out 5g and that that company has
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
been banned in certain places because of
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
security reasons and they are the ones
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
behind the research and that are doing
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
this so that was another thing that kind
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
dent in my brain and said wait a minute
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
if other countries are doing this
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to find out why and i
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to mention the name of the
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
company but they i believe hawaii has
 
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
company but they i believe hawaii has
banned

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
banned
 
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.029 align:start position:0%
banned
5g

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
5g
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
and other other companies because of the
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
involvement with this particular company
 
00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:00.630 align:start position:0%
involvement with this particular company
so

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know and we have no control over
 
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.669 align:start position:0%
i don't know and we have no control over
that

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
that
we

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
have seated that authority so i i just
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about this 5g
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and also the warning to the people that
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
your phone may not work you may not be
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
able to make a 911 call and that that
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
scared me because even if you have a
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
deadline in your house if there's nobody
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
living there and you have
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
what was a landline
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
you could be able to plug into that line
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
or it used to be that you could make
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
911 but you could call 9-1-1 so if your
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
cell phone is disabled if you have an
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
older cell phone like i do
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to make a 9-1-1 call
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
in an emergency so there's a lot of
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
implications and the one thing that
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
really sparked my interest because all
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
of this i said well it's gonna happen
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll be up to 10 g by time i'm dead
 
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
and we'll be up to 10 g by time i'm dead
was

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
what the faa
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
the problems the faa had
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
and saying wait a minute
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
this can
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
this radiation that nothing can get
 
00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
this radiation that nothing can get
through

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
in this report
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
can affect the altimeters and planes
 
00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
can affect the altimeters and planes
um

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
makes me a little bit worried and that
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're now going to
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
have perimeters around airports so that
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
that worried me too so if it can affect
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
an airplane like that
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
how could it affect me
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
well i thank you for that and um
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
i would add though that from my reading
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh the faa is concerned about it ruling
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
out but it's it's i don't believe it's
 
00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:41.029 align:start position:0%
out but it's it's i don't believe it's
because

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the actual um
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
what the the uh
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
effects of the of the wavelength would
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.630 align:start position:0%
effects of the of the wavelength would
cause

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's more because of the narrowness of
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth that lies between
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth they use for the
 
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth they use for the
altimeter

00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
altimeter
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
settings uh on the airplanes and the uh
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
5g technology now my understanding
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
between five seven and five nine is
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
where the the new 5g technology falls
 
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.470 align:start position:0%
where the the new 5g technology falls
within

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there is only a
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
0.3 gigahertz separation between the
 
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
0.3 gigahertz separation between the
bands

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
bands
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
and that to me coming and having working
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
for 29 years
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the communications area
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
for acquisitions there that there that's
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
a very narrow ban for possible bleed
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
over and if you don't have good
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
insulation on some of these older planes
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there are there's a chance that it
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
could bleed over and affect the
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
altimeter reading uh particularly during
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
landing at low levels i believe that's
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
what the faa is concerned about that's a
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
different issue than what we're
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
discussing here though
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
it was a concern of mine but that's more
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
of a bandwidth separation issue
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think here we are also interested in
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
the the health
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
how it affects organic people
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
well all people are good some people may
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
not be organic but most most of them are
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
but um how it affects people and so
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
i rely on a lot of um
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
reports that are being put out
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
the world which we know the rest of the
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
world europe and particularly australia
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
are probably
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
the first ones to put any mandates up on
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
anything that they don't think is safe
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
or good and they haven't yet
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
they they have done studies on this and
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
they they claim that it's safe but i
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
safe is a relative term i understand
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i cannot deny that some people
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
are very sensitive to this type of
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
frequency at any bandwidth from from
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
radio to tv
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh even near airports with you know
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
radar and they can be affected just like
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
someone could be effective living in a
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
forest versus
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
urbanus or being affected in other ways
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
there certainly seems to be a
 
00:30:56.399 --> 00:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
there certainly seems to be a
correlation

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see a whole lot of evidence
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
right now where there is a causation
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
which is a major factor but uh i'm
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
getting off track here just a little bit
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitch you brought
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
up about the
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 since you brought that up i i
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
would like i i believe there's a
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman here from the department of
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
safety i'm sorry sir what was your name
 
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:19.909 align:start position:0%
safety i'm sorry sir what was your name
again

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
mark doyle uh
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
he he may want to speak briefly about
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
the safety factory involving 9-1-1 and
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
other things if you would occur how how
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
would this affect how this bill affect
 
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
would this affect how this bill affect
that

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
i still have to get used to this
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
i thank you for um inviting me
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative thomas to speak to
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that narrowly focused issue uh
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pittsburgh my name
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
is mark doyle i'm the director of the
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
division of emergency services and
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
communications overseeing 9-1-1 with the
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
you spoke to
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
older cell phones and the technology
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
associated with all the cell phones on
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
the 3g
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
frequency bandwidth and
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of companies i know that
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
t-mobile sprint at t and verizon are all
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
phasing out their 3g networks this year
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
part and parcel to accommodate more
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
space and network allocation and
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
bandwidth toward the 5g rollout long
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
story short
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with folks that
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
have those 3g capable cell phones right
 
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
have those 3g capable cell phones right
now

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
is they will not be able to communicate
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
even for the purpose of contacting 9-1-1
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
many folks had had and hung onto a lot
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
of those what we would call
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
decommissioned or inactive cell phones
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
never had a subscription plan associated
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
with them but they were kicking around
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
at people's desks and whatnot and we
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
give them to their
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um their children because they still
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
always had 911
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
associated with them meaning that even
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
though they didn't have a subscription
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
service you could still dial 9-1-1 every
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone is like that by the way the
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
problem associated with the old 3g
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
network is once the 3g network goes away
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
that capability goes away with it as
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
well so we've been trying to do our due
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
diligence to message out to folks that
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
if you have an older 3g phone 3g capable
 
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.149 align:start position:0%
if you have an older 3g phone 3g capable
phone

00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's on the 3g network to make sure
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
you connect with your your uh your
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
cellular digital network whomever that
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
carrier might be that telecom of that
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
lte carrier so that you can find out if
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
your phone's affected if it's only a 3g
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
phone and what you need to do to go
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
ahead and update that subscription so
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
you can get a phone that's capable of
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
dialing 9-1-1 either through the current
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
4g system or the
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
the scaling out of the 5g network
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
you represent cali pitts thank you
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
for for for talking to that speaking to
 
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.750 align:start position:0%
for for for talking to that speaking to
that

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.909 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
in some of the literature i read
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
it ford 3g was
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
also 4g
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
which is a more modern
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
i would think phone
 
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
i would think phone
and

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
i know the government's going to do
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
something to replace them or whatever
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
to that phone
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a little bit i am
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit over the top and i
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
i helped put in the 911 network that's
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
how old i am
 
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
how old i am
uh

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that that
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
people could have to buy another phone
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
but that seems a little bit uh it's
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
scary to me that somebody needs to reach
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
out and call 9-1-1 and can't
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
so and not everybody's going to get that
 
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.909 align:start position:0%
so and not everybody's going to get that
message

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
message
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't have it
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
until i started digging through the
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
research so how do we deal with
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
that particular thing and is that going
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be do you know if that's going to be
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
everywhere or just in
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
proximity of these towers
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question that's
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually a very good question my
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is when it comes to the
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
impact on 4g
 
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
impact on 4g
is

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
i've not heard any of that in any of the
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
industry news that's been pushed out
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
again it's only the 3g capable cell
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
phones that are going to be impacted and
 
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.190 align:start position:0%
phones that are going to be impacted and
affected

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
so to your point how do we make sure
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we get the message out relative to
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
impacting folks that have the 3g phone
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
still and i understand there are
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
probably thousands or tens of thousands
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
of these still kicking around whether
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're being used actively or whether
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're in people's draws at home that
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
they've had that they've been having for
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
years and just never really activated
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
and have no subscription service we've
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
got to do our due diligence to assist
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
the telecoms the telecommunications
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
carriers lt network provisioners
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
and assist in getting that message to
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
all the folks in the state it's not just
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire it's not
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
just to those telecommunication carriers
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
i mean this is something that's come
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
down from our own industry at 9-1-1 as
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
well as through the fcc the federal
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
communications commission to let folks
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
know that this is happening what i have
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
heard anecdotally is that a lot of the
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
carriers have sent messages out through
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
the mail or otherwise to the folks that
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
subscribe to those services right now
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
letting them know what the end of life
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
is for their 3g capable phone i think
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
verizon has theirs and their deadline is
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
the end of this year i believe sprint
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
t-mobile are coming up in may and june
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
respectively and i think att is starting
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
their phasing out as early as february
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
so it's important that everybody does
 
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.069 align:start position:0%
so it's important that everybody does
their

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
their best effort to make sure that
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
people are aware that those phones are
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to go by the wayside and the
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
capabilities associated with them are
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to cease thank you
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh does anyone hack
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
you mrs doyle uh if you're standing by
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
here for the rest of the meeting it'd be
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
great if if if some questions come
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're certainly welcome to stay and
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the invite representative
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
thomas i appreciate that thank you thank

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
before we move on i uh is there anyone
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
here that represents ctia or the
 
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.470 align:start position:0%
here that represents ctia or the
industry

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the testimony from
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.230 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
at one point here they they say that um
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll read this quote
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
let's see acting responsibly scientists
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
engineers continue to research rf
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
exposure including rf exposure with 5g
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
technology for example studies have
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
shown that 5g communication which will
 
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.630 align:start position:0%
shown that 5g communication which will
take

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of small cell network
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
architecture rests in more base stations
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
operating at lower point
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
power levels
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that further a recent
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
study demonstrated that 5g antenna
 
00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
study demonstrated that 5g antenna
densification

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
densification
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
does not increase the level of exposure
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
in contrast to a very popular belief on
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
the contrary antenna densification does
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
not change the exposure levels for the
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
majority of the population while at base
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
station proximity a huge radiation
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
decrease is experienced when more base
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
stations are deployed in the same
 
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
stations are deployed in the same
territory

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
territory
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
i was hoping if anyone here could maybe
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
speak to that or have any knowledge on
 
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
speak to that or have any knowledge on
that

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:46.470 align:start position:0%
if you
could

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative honor um i i don't i just
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
i have a stack of the testimony that we
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
heard and it's just down the hall i'm
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
just going to run and get it
 
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.310 align:start position:0%
just going to run and get it
okay

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes state your name and who you
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
represent i'm kent chamberlain and i'm
 
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:02.150 align:start position:0%
represent i'm kent chamberlain and i'm
uh

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
from durham new hampshire and i served
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the commission we have two other
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
people who served on the commission
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
behind me so
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry about that
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
but uh before i start i should say that
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
tell a little bit about who i am because
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a contentious issue
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
not contentious because the science
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
isn't clear but it's contentious because
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot at stake
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
in particular money-wise so i'm ken
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
chamberlain culture okay and
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
before i joined the commission and while
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
i served on the commission i was chair
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the department of electrical and
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
computer engineering at the university
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason i was asked to serve on
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
the commission was because of my
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
background in electromagnetics and
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
radiofrequency engineering so i've got a
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
lot of experience and with the the
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions and the comments that were
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
made earlier and i can certainly address
 
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
made earlier and i can certainly address
them

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
but what i'd like to start off with oh
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i also should mention is that i'm
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i've come out of the ivory tower
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
many many times in my 40-year career
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
i've worked with 25 research sponsors
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
from industry and government agencies in
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
fact i worked on it's called project 54
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
that deals with first responders and
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
communications they need so i'm very
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
sensitive to not only the needs of
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
industry but also the needs of first
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
responders and people who need to
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
communicate via things like 9-1-1
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming to you now as a citizen
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm unpaid
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
for what i do so i don't have any vested
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
interest in what i'm going to tell you
 
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.390 align:start position:0%
interest in what i'm going to tell you
today

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think a starting point would be to say
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that you know you talked a lot about
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
frequencies and this is something of
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
course we looked at on the commission
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
remember the commission met on a regular
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
basis throughout the year and we did a
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
lot of studying on our own
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
and so some things
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
and this discussion of frequencies came
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
up very early on
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line for that is that we
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
found that the frequencies the all the
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
frequencies that you named for digital
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
communication are harmful now it's very
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
likely that some frequencies are going
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be more harmful than others but it's
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
really the the research done so far has
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
not parsed that out
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
so all of the frequencies that are used
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
for digital communication starting with
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
500 megahertz on up
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
do have adverse physiological effects
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
and they've been very thoroughly
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
documented in the literature
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the first point i want to make
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
we also found as you can probably tell
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have looked at the
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
conclusions of our final report we found
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
that exposure to radiation does cause
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
significant harm
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
and this is cell phone type radiation
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
so we've looked at the epidemiology in
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
fact it's pretty clear i don't know why
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
there uh a link was sent to you about a
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
video that i we came up with our
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
rationale for
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
setting a 500 meter setback
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason is and you do this
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
several ways one is you can look at
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
people living near cell towers and find
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
out how their health your adverse health
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
effects for those people and then
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
plot that as a function of the distance
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
they live from the cell towers now
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's been done in 10 studies and an
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
eight of the ten of those studies it
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
showed that at about 500 meters you're
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to start not seeing adverse
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
effects from living near a cell tower
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
so the fact that i can even talk about
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that to begin with the fact that
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
mortality rates drop off when you look
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
at people the distance people live from
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
a cell tower that in itself is a good
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
indication a strong indication that
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
they're the the living nearest cell
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
tower isn't good for you and that is the
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
focus of our legislation the legislation
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you have one cell tower right in your
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
backyard you're far more likely to die
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
of things like cancer but there are many
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
other things too cancer is just one
 
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.870 align:start position:0%
other things too cancer is just one
issue

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
what happens when you're exposed to
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
radiation the type of radiation that
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about cell phone type
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
radiation is that there is what's
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
referred to as oxidative radiation
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
so it was talked about earlier was
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation and that's where the
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
photons the individual photons have
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
enough energy to knock electrons off of
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
atoms and cause mutations we know about
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that's what causes things like skin
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
cancer i know firsthand about that i had
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
to go to the dermatologist to get some
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
of that burned off so we know about that
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we've known about it for a long time
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
but what it seems to be somewhat newer
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
is the fact that it's radiation like the
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
radiation you get from your cell phone
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
causes oxidative radiation oxidative
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard these terms before um free
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
radicals that comes from oxidizing
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
radiation that's why we eat antioxidant
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
foods and take supplements to lower our
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
oxidation is that we don't want those
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
free radicals in our body and that's
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what cell phone radiation cell
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
phone type radiation wireless radiation
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
does to your body
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:03.030 align:start position:0%
does to your body
so

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
what we've found is that if you move
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
away from the transmitter if you had
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember this only pertains to future
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
installations but if you're at 500
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
meters or more from a cell phone
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
transmitter you're less likely it's very
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
likely that you won't experience any
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
adverse health effects at all
 
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
adverse health effects at all
so

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is the basic finding the science so
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that we did it by looking at
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
the epidemiology first that is look at
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
the health outcomes of people living
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
near towers we also looked at what the
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes were in laboratory experiments
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
so in the laboratory you can very
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
carefully adjust what the exposure
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
levels are for for whatever it is that
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're studying and find out set kind of
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
a lower level that where you say that
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
below this level adverse effects don't
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
happen so we identified what that signal
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
level was
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then found out how far from a
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
typical cell tower you would have to go
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
to achieve that level of radiation
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
turns out that both ways of making this
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
calculation came up with the same basic
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
result they weren't exact but they were
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
very very close and that is 500 meters
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:11.950 align:start position:0%
very very close and that is 500 meters
or

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
1640 feet
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
so we came up we have a very solid
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
rationale scientific based rationale for
 
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
rationale scientific based rationale for
saying

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't put towers closer than 1
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
640 feet from places where people live
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
work and recreate
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
so by doing that by following what is
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
asked for in this legislation we will go
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
a long way in protecting the people of
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
a type of exposure that can be pretty
 
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
a type of exposure that can be pretty
severe

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
severe
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr emma i have a question
 
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr emma i have a question
before

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee um
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
so where i was reading where
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
the 5g technology i used 5g because i
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
know it's that's not frequency but the
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
the 5g technology i read becomes
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
ineffective at around a thousand feet
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh now it begs the question do you mean
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's ineffective in terms of um
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
being able to be useful for
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
communications or is does it mean
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
ineffective in terms of it has no effect
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
on anybody or anything i don't know
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
anyone here that can answer that
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
question but if that being the case and
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
we were to put this at 500 meters uh you
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
you would effectively shut down
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
all of that type of communication
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh in in those areas and particularly
 
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh in in those areas and particularly
around

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals and businesses that rely
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
heavily on faster data would that not be
 
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
heavily on faster data would that not be
correct

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that should be
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned here one is that 5g is more or
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
less a marketing term there is no recipe
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
for 5g and in fact there are a lot of 5g
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
transmitters that do have nothing to do
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the higher frequencies they're
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
using the same frequencies as 4g
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that's one reason that we didn't
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
make an exclusion for only the higher
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
frequencies that's something that could
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
be looked at later but what you could
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
conceivably do if we made that exception
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
for 5g now is simply move
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the 4g towers put them into
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
these little small cells and radiate at
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
the same level as they're radiating now
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
which would cause greater exposure
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's another statement that i'd like
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
to make and that regard involves 5g and
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that was said earlier is
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
the claim that radiation levels go down
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
when you put in 5g and that's not the
 
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.309 align:start position:0%
when you put in 5g and that's not the
case

00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
5g piggybacks on top of 4g
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
so when you add 5g you add to the total
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
radiation and this has been shown in
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
cities where 5g has been installed there
 
00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:38.630 align:start position:0%
cities where 5g has been installed there
are

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
studies that go on where people measure
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
the radiation level in various cities
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing effort and i can give
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
you links to that so when you go to a
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
city that has 4g only and below you're
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to have certain radiation levels
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
as you move through the city but when
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
you go to a city that has 5g installed
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
your radiation levels go up
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
and what we discovered on the commission
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
is that radiation is like smog if you
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
will like air pollution that you have
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
background levels and at certain points
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
they start rising and rising and people
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
start getting sick from it and that's
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
why some people who aren't electro
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
hypersensitive now become electro hyper
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive as they're exposed to
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
increasing levels of background
 
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
increasing levels of background
radiation

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll allow myself one
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up before moving on um so uh i
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
think the quote that i read uh previous
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
to q coming on and talked in terms of
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
densification which i believe it's as
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
you put more antennas together your
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
overall effects might go down i i will
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
say that from my experience um
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
working a bit in the
 
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:49.349 align:start position:0%
working a bit in the
military

00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
military
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
acquisition field
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of concern when you put
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
too many antennas together that their
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
overall effects
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
go down because there's a lot of
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
interference and scattering so the
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
effects go down would that not be the
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
same type of technology
 
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.870 align:start position:0%
same type of technology
this

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
in this way if you put two main tenants
 
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.589 align:start position:0%
in this way if you put two main tenants
together

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you actually decrease
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
their their power
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that flies in the face of the
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
physics that i know
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that is that it's at times there
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
will be cancellation certainly but at
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
other times there's going to be
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
reinforcements so you're going to have a
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
signal now that varies rapidly and
 
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.549 align:start position:0%
signal now that varies rapidly and
hugely

00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
hugely
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the final analysis the total exposure
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be the sum of all
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
transmitters of all radiation sources
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.910 align:start position:0%
okay sure

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
um as i've been listening to the
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
information that's being presented in
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of of radiation
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's being emitted uh that we're that
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're discussing
 
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.270 align:start position:0%
we're discussing
um

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've got mega
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
megahertz and also
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
gigahertz and those are two very
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
different things in terms of uh amounts
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
and when i just heard you say that we we
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
have used the science in order to
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
determine a calculation of what would be
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
a safe distance
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what level of hurts you
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
are applying to the technology so that
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
we could maybe understand how these
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
equations were calculated
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and i can go through them
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
with you right now
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
but like said it's not the hurts
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
as long as we're talking about digital
 
00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:28.549 align:start position:0%
as long as we're talking about digital
radiation

00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
you know 600 megahertz and above
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
it seems you know the evidence shows
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
they are are all
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
all harmful but what matters is the
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
exposure level and that would be the
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
milliwatts or watts per meter squared
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
so you have a radiation source you could
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
even consider light bulb it's radiating
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
down and so how much energy is coming
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
out of that light bulb or how much of
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
that is striking me
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the watts per area
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
multiplied times the area that's being
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
exposed so it's the radiation level or
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
the power level that determines what's
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
harmful that's we're finding
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
so we there i can give you numbers we're
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
thinking that the lower limit would be
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
500 microwatts
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
per meter squared now there's some
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
people who would still be affected by
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
that the people who are electro
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
hypersensitive and by the way that is a
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
real thing it's recognized by the
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act and with
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
medic by medicare so it's a real thing
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so people that are electrosensitive
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
at 500 microwatts per meter squared
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're still going to be
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
feeling it so our legislation the
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation won't protect
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
everybody absolutely but it will make
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
them you know provide them with some
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
protection against the more severe
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
effects that might occur at higher
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
exposure levels
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative white
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
so you you mentioned a second ago about
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
americans uh there's a law that
 
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
americans uh there's a law that
recognizes

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.630 align:start position:0%
recognizes
these

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
what what is there in terms of research
 
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.589 align:start position:0%
what what is there in terms of research
though

00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
that recognizes these uh disabilities
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
people that are more sensitive to
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radiation and things
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking the work by martin paul i
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
mean there is a whole trove of
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
information and maybe this is something
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind i'd like to say about
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
the commission is where we got our
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
information that would answer a question
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
like the one you're answering are you
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
asking right now
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
one of my jobs on the commission
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
was to look at the quality of journals
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
that were being used to to to get our
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
provider information
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from the telecommunications
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
industry and remember they don't like
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
our our
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
pronouncement that the there is harm in
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
radiation exposure so what they do what
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
they have claimed is that all articles
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
that show harm from radiation exposure
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
are from what they call fringe journals
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
and they are cherry picked
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's absolutely not true and so
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
one of my jobs on the commission was to
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
look at that and evaluate whether or not
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
there were fringe journals and the
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
reason i was picked for that job is
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
because i am a former associate editor
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
for ieee transactions on attendance and
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
propagation so it's a major scientific
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
publication and i was an associate
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
editor so i was given that task is to
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
look at the articles that showed harm
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
and determine if they were from quality
 
00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
and determine if they were from quality
journals

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
journals
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i can just tell you shortly and in
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
short terms now that yes absolutely high
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
highly credible journals with the
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
editors the the
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
authors of the journals the reviewers
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
were all from recognized universities
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so the information was rock solid so
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
there are many articles that do show the
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
adverse effects that i'm talking about
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
right now and those are what we looked
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
at and there are hundreds if not
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of articles showing that from
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
reputable journals so yeah this is not
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
something new uh showing that the harm
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
the harm that's recognized and has been
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
recognized by the ada for a while it is
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
well known in the science
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think so thank you
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
can you tell me uh
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
is the uh
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
report from the commission
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes it's online uh representative abrami
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like uh you should he should
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
i i would really
 
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.630 align:start position:0%
i i would really
miss

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
chair i would really like i mean in lou
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a phone book to read
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
anymore i really would like to read the
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
report and see if i can make
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
more heads in the tales of it and and
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
see again your sources
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh and look at that so i no objection to
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
going online
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
of course i don't have 5g so it'll take
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
me four days
 
00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.109 align:start position:0%
me four days
but

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
but
i

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
i just um would like to know what
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is the beginning part of the report
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
reports 390 pages long 290 pages long
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
created by a commission in new hampshire
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of that's minutes a lot of that's
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
all the references that
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
dr chamberlain is talking about we have
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of references of from science
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
you should be talking about
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
romney could if you're going to speak a
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
long time would you like mike please
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i i thought you had a brief
 
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
statement that's what i did too
 
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.230 align:start position:0%
statement that's what i did too
[Laughter]

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
i guess i can't help myself we spent a
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
lot of time on this as a commission 14
 
00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:19.829 align:start position:0%
lot of time on this as a commission 14
months

00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
we we've accumulated thousands of papers
 
00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.430 align:start position:0%
we we've accumulated thousands of papers
as

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
dr chaiman is talking about that are all
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
referenced in
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
the report and dependencies of the
 
00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.630 align:start position:0%
the report and dependencies of the
report

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
and matter of fact in the body of the
 
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.870 align:start position:0%
and matter of fact in the body of the
report

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
they are linked if you so we if you get
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
the report you can when we talk about
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
something we link it to specific papers
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
that relate to it so
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
but for a committee like this it's it's
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
a it's an overwhelming task to go
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
through all the science we did
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying we did the homework
 
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.309 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying we did the homework
for

00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:52.319 --> 00:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
for
for

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
this moment we did the homework for this
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a bill to be brought forward
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was it was very difficult in the
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
initial meeting to express all that we
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
know we appreciate the time today
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is giving us a chance to in a more
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
informal setting
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
to try to get through some of the signs
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
to you and i and as i as i step down
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
from here i'd like you to bring i like
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
to bring ken wells to sit next to him
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
because and you all know ken from being
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
a science and tech guy
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
and ken was on the commission as well
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh but he's got a background in physics
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
as well so we've got the two physics
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
guys here that could could shed some
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
light on this yeah represent kelly pitts
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
i need a follow-up i asked a very simple
 
00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:37.270 align:start position:0%
i need a follow-up i asked a very simple
question

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
where can i reference this report can
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
you give me a website
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to send
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to send a link to the com i
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't have it it's it's a long link so i
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
will send a link to the to the chair or
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
to the i'll send a link to i'll send a
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
link to you and the rest of the
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:57:58.799 --> 00:57:59.589 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
i do have a question um well uh
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
i guess for anyone that was on on the
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
commission i i understand there
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
that there is that there was a minority
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
report on that commission report is
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
there anyone here that could speak to
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the minority report at all
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
not that i see let me explain the
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
minority report that's the way
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
commissions work
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
we when i i filed a bill to create the
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
5g commission so i said well let's have
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's have
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
let's have the people from the industry
 
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.910 align:start position:0%
let's have the people from the industry
so

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
ctia who you're referencing um
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
beth cooley
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
who is
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist i wanted a scientist
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted a scientist from the ctia to be
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
on the committee but there wasn't so i
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
thought we would have a dialogue in this
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee probably naively
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could come to some
 
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
thinking that we could come to some
terms

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
as to the issue
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
so she was an honorary of course of
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
course she was going to be the minority
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
she's representing the industry
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
then we had i also requested that the
 
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.589 align:start position:0%
then we had i also requested that the
bia

00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
bia
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
find me a scientist business industry
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
association of new hampshire
 
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.789 align:start position:0%
association of new hampshire
and

00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find a scientist
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of high-tech
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
companies here i wanted somebody with
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
background and radio frequency and all
 
00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.589 align:start position:0%
background and radio frequency and all
that

00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
dave gervais who most of us know
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i can't find anybody but i'll i'll
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
sit on it
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
but i mean after the first meeting dave
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
for dave you know because we really got
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
into the science and his eyes were
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
rolling you know like wow
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
but dave
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
dave was
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
never came to the meetings until the
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
very end and was one of the two in the
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
minority report
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then of course there was senator
 
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.910 align:start position:0%
and then of course there was senator
gray

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
gray
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
who had some legitimate arguments
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
but those were the three people who
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
voted for the minority report two of
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
them you know and and and dave basically
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
represents businesses who don't
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
understand the detail of this don't
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
understand the science of this
 
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:08.950 align:start position:0%
understand the science of this
and

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i i love day i mean i work
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
with dave all the time so i'm just not
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
disparaging mark but
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
and again
the

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.069 align:start position:0%
the
this

01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're here to say that the science is
 
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:22.710 align:start position:0%
we're here to say that the science is
there

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're trying to find a way of
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
taking a first step by this bill to do
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
something we'd love to work with the
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
science and tech committee here
 
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:32.789 align:start position:0%
science and tech committee here
to

01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
to if if this is in the bill that you
 
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
to if if this is in the bill that you
like

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
we create uh some kind of a
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of this group to continue
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
i can bring in experts of science like
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
dr chamberlain uh high quality uh people
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
who understand this again it took me a
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
while to figure this out too i'm an
 
01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.630 align:start position:0%
while to figure this out too i'm an
engineer

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
but you know through the we brought in a
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
lot of experts into this committee from
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
around the country uh around the country
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
and this is no small this is not just
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
all eyes are on this
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
you you all got hundreds of emails
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
from around the country and around the
 
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.430 align:start position:0%
from around the country and around the
world

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
on this topic
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
because no one's listening
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
no one's listening
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the fcc is a captive
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
a captive agency
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
everybody in the fcc came from the
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
industry their job is in science their
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
job is to allocate bandwidth that's what
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
they do they allocate bandwidth
 
01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:40.710 align:start position:0%
they do they allocate bandwidth
but

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
but they rely on the fda
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
but the fda
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
much of their own science they may
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
review some papers whatever
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
but we as a commission little new
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire tried to get the the fcc tried
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
to get the fda to answer our questions
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
our specific questions
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
and this refers to a website
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
oh good we had very specific questions
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
so was the science that you have
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
that says this isn't harmful show us the
 
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
that says this isn't harmful show us the
science

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we got
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
then we then we even tried the
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency they
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
used to have a role
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
years ago before 1996 before the
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
telecommunication act of 1916 1996
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
and that when we reached out to them
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
they said not our job
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have any funding for this not
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
our mission but they are probably the
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
most equipped to to really weigh in on
 
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
most equipped to to really weigh in on
this

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.270 align:start position:0%
this
so

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.549 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is really putting a lot on
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
your shoulders here
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying okay maybe maybe we pass
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill maybe we don't pass this bill
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't want this dialogue to die
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
i i think we need to somehow
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
craft something that
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
we can keep this going and
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's an important topic
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
and again i'm not i'm not
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not the kind of guy that is um
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
a warrior when it comes to
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
these kind of
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
most things i don't i'm not the guy i'm
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
out there doing this but after i learned
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i sat through the commission for 14
 
01:03:16.319 --> 01:03:17.190 align:start position:0%
and i sat through the commission for 14
months

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
i said wow
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's something here
 
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
there's something here
and

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
so those those are so my thoughts and i
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
i do wish you hit from
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
former representative
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
wells as well because he has so much
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
interesting insights as well to share
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
with you
today

01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay a question uh representative
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know this is really difficult
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
because you like you said we got emails
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
from everywhere from all over and
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's always two sides to every story
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
so we hear from some scientists that say
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
people are getting sick and it's bad we
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
got to stop this other scientists are
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
saying that they're they're it's not
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's inconclusive and you can't prove it
 
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.230 align:start position:0%
it's inconclusive and you can't prove it
and

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are all going haywire well
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
earlier when the chairman was talking
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
about talcum powder reminding me of a
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
workshop i went to about the toxic world
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
we live in there's toxins everywhere
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
there's chemicals in everything it's in
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
our food it's in mattresses it's in
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
carpets it's in our clothing it's like
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
people are hypersensitive i mean how far
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
do we go
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
um we are sympathetic to people that are
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
that are sense are hypersensitive to
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
say with absolute certainty that the
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
technology is what's making them sick
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know the jury's still out on that
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
because there's always conflicting
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
science but one thing we do know and
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
that we cannot forget is that
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
the industry is never going to support
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill and it's going
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
to halt future investments in new
 
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.109 align:start position:0%
to halt future investments in new
hampshire

01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
so it's very very difficult let's hear
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
all this i don't think they're going to
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
abandon this market
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
again all we're asking for is that
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we're i think in my opening
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
comments in the hearing was simple i
 
01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:05.589 align:start position:0%
comments in the hearing was simple i
said

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
we all love our cell phones we all want
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
them but do we need to watch a
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
full-length movie
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
while we're walking down the street
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's what we're talking about i
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
i mean that's what we're talking about i
mean

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
mean
uh

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're all for safe
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
science safe
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
science and that's all we're talking
 
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.910 align:start position:0%
science and that's all we're talking
about

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
and and by the way let's not confuse
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
broadband there's some confusion and
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
with with this
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
broadband is we're all for optical uh
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.029 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
but yes it's part a small part of the
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
the whole discussion of this but
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's not it's up you know what we're
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
doing in that front is a whole nother
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative and thank
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
you for um spinning this bill um
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned broadband and that
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
was piqued my interest because i just
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
became familiar with a term called
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
mobile broadband
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
they're claiming speeds with uh f5 up to
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh 50 megabytes per second
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
however an article from last year the
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
said that the actual
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
speeds that one
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
can expect are far lower than that
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
i've seen nothing to
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
contradict that
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
so again i mean i would love to see us
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
be able to have driverless cars and all
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
that some future point
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh right now
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
i got stranded in nelson a couple weeks
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
back because my electric car died here
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i could not call my garage because i
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
could not get cell coverage
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
warner i don't see this as the end of
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
cellular technology if we do not
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate 5g but if i'm wrong please
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
and another question that you had
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
earlier about uh cto2 questions ctia
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
they claim that
 
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
they claim that
aviation

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
aviation
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh emissions will not be any greater
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
with a higher density
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
is it the equivalent of building more
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
swimming pools
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
and saying that
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
we can build more swimming pools
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
and cluster them closer together
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
and one swimming pool may not affect the
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
quality of water and then on a swimming
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
pool but children are going to get
 
01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
pool but children are going to get
wetter

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
wetter
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
um i mean is that a workable and an
 
01:07:38.799 --> 01:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
um i mean is that a workable and an
allergy

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
actually i'm not sure how to answer that
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
one but just the you know the more and
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
let's put it this way instead of
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
swimming pools let's call it smokers
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
if one of us were in this room smoking
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
we would have a level of toxin pollution
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
but if we were all smoking chain smoking
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
that level would come up so the more
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
smokers there are the more radiation
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
sources there are the more sources of
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
pollution will affect us and have
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
negative effects on us is that a fair
 
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.069 align:start position:0%
negative effects on us is that a fair
analogy

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying i would ask
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
again if if the person from ctia was
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
here i would ask her to if she could uh
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
explain it another way then because it
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like it and and i and it does
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
from what i was reading i'm not sure if
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
it meant that the effects would be any
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
less or more but i think it was talking
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.789 align:start position:0%
in terms of
power

01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
is it possible that if you combine
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
several antennas closer together that
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need as much power
 
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need as much power
to

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
to have coverage as they would if they
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
had lesser antennas is that a fair
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
question i think that's it's a fair
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
question and i can see where if you
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
distribute you have distributed antennas
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
yes you could then use lower power
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
total depend there there are a lot of
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
caveats here it's how you implement it
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
but if you had one that was only
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
transmitting when there was somebody
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
that was communicating with that
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
particular tower i could see that that
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be the case but please keep in
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
mind that where they've made the
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
measurements that hasn't been the
 
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:23.349 align:start position:0%
measurements that hasn't been the
reality

01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
where they've made measurement places
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
with 5g have a higher background
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
radiation than those places that don't
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
have 5g
 
01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:31.669 align:start position:0%
have 5g
so

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
i i've heard some of these arguments but
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
they don't really make sense
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
and there's one other issue that i
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to address and then with some
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
somebody talking about coverage area and
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
remember that my a lot of my career has
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
been spent modeling propagation where
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
can you get signals if you put a tower
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
here here or here
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
so you can provide coverage so if you're
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
stranded in your car that's because
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a tower nearby obviously
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a question of what markets the
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
the cell industry wants to maintain and
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
where they want to put antennas
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
as a radio frequency engineer somebody
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
who's modeled electromagnetics i can
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
tell you you can do it it may be it's a
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
function of cost it may cost you more to
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
put in that tall tower that gives you
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
that broader coverage area and provides
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
lower exposure to individuals
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
but it can be done and it's just a
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry represent partial you could
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
ask your follow-on question but before
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
that i would advise you to carry a power
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
pack with you in your car wherever you
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
go just just in case you know we all
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
make mistakes and i made a big one on
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
that one i'm not hit you know i'm not
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
ashamed to admit it
 
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.030 align:start position:0%
ashamed to admit it
um

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have this information at hand uh
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
but i've heard that the current
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
commission at the fcc the five appointed
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner well i guess one is
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
vacant now but the four seats um
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
equally democrat and republican
 
01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
equally democrat and republican
um

01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
they all are drawn from
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
ctia background and where they have
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
served as lobbyists within that industry
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's true or not do
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
you have any information on that i don't
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
have the current information but i
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that people look at the the
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
harvard report and you can find that
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
hardwood report by googling harvard
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
fcc and captured and they go through
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
exactly who's been serving and when
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the case and they they
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
equate what's going on with with the
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry now and cell
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
phone exposure they equate that to the
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco industry
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
is that of course tobacco probably some
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
of them still claim it doesn't cause
 
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.070 align:start position:0%
of them still claim it doesn't cause
cancer

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
cancer
but

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
the it seems like the telecommunication
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
industry is following that playbook and
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's according to this harvard report
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah a lot of the people running the
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
fcc are from industry
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you represent kelly pitts
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up on something since
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
we were doing swimming pools and brought
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
my mind to pigs
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
you said that four
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
5g piggybacks on 4g so if you
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't roll out the 5g as comprehensively
 
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
don't roll out the 5g as comprehensively
as

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's they want to do it
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
would it stop
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
or would it inhibit
 
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
or would it inhibit
um

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.510 align:start position:0%
um
eliminating

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
dead zones in new hampshire if we
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
stopped that would we then cause a
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
problem or exacerbate a problem
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
with quote unquote dead spots
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
if we stopped the rollout or somehow
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
inhibited the rollout of 5g
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
would that inhibit us or stop us
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
from answering the problem of dead zones
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
and dead spots
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
so i mean my answer would be no
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
you would have to i mean assuming that
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
you would use 4g technology to fill in
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
by the way 5g is mostly for data
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
4g 3g is for telecommunications talking
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
any more questions for these two
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen before we go to
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
the honorable
 
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.390 align:start position:0%
the honorable

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
wells
representative

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is what's going on in the country
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
communities are trying to do something
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a hard battle
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
through ordinances to try to
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
limit where the antennas are
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
not not ban it but limit it
 
01:13:59.679 --> 01:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
not not ban it but limit it
again

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
backtrack one thing 5g is a concept we
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
talked about a marketing concept
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
each one of the companies has their own
 
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.830 align:start position:0%
each one of the companies has their own
strategy

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.630 align:start position:0%
strategy
now

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
now
what

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
what the new wrinkle was millimeter
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
waves okay we went up further up the
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
up up the uh spectrum
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
but as as the chair mentioned millimeter
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
waves don't travel very far
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
so by about 1000 maybe a thousand feet
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:30.709 align:start position:0%
or something like that
so

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
if we go 5g in that route using
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
small cell antennas
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
those antennas would have to be spaced
 
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.709 align:start position:0%
those antennas would have to be spaced
every

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
200 200 yards
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
on telephone poles
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
in front of your house
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's what got me going i said to
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
myself do i really want one of those in
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
front of my house probably not
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
but we're powerless because of the 1996
 
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
but we're powerless because of the 1996
act

01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
i say to myself forget about the health
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
forget about all that
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
we as americans
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
are beholden to a 1996 act and standards
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
that have not changed
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
since 1996
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
they just re-upped their standards in
 
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.189 align:start position:0%
they just re-upped their standards in
2019

01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%

both sued and i told i mentioned this in
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the last in my presentation
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
court of appeals in dc
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh circuit
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
said that that the fcc's
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
reissuing of the same standards
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
was arbitrary and capricious they did
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
not review the science
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
that and that's what the court said and
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
that something to me was a big flag you
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
know maybe we're onto something here
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
this came out last summer last august
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
now where the court of appeals were
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
weighing in on a federal agency
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
not doing what they were supposed to do
 
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.830 align:start position:0%
not doing what they were supposed to do
in

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
in
publishing

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.950 align:start position:0%
publishing
regulations

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
and but understand that those those
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
standards have not changed
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
and someone had mentioned
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
about power density yeah you know we
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
talked about power it really is
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately about power density coming
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
out of the antennas
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we we considered that in the
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
commission saying well maybe we
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
we can say you know let's measure the
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
power densities around because
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
who's testing all this stuff nobody
 
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
who's testing all this stuff nobody
nobody

01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the problem who's who's
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
overseeing this stuff
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not the federal government you
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
see trucks out there measuring no do you
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
see the state we're not measuring
 
01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:49.750 align:start position:0%
see the state we're not measuring
so

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's the that's the
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
our country has the highest standards
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
in reverse really the lowest standards i
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
mean the highest
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
number i forget the number now
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
the 10 watts per meter squared thank you
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
as acceptable
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
other developed countries
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that much lower standards and
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
why is that you know it's like
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
we can go we can go country to country
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
even countries like india have have
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
lower standards and russia have lower
 
01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.750 align:start position:0%
lower standards and russia have lower
standards

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
standards
so

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
but yes power density we say well
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of one of the one of the things we
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
had talked about in the commission is
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
well why don't we just establish that we
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
would we would measure the state would
 
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
would we would measure the state would
measure

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know each around
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
different areas as to what the densities
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
are of of the rf radiation
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
of the the amounts
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a compounding
 
01:17:47.679 --> 01:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a compounding
effect

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
depending on where these antennas are
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
of of this radiation
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of stuff that we
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
talked about in the community you know
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
we talked about the modulating issues
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
about the uh
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
co what's that called the cone
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
but there's there's
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the patterns in the now and the
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
pulse signals that these these are
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
pulsing waves
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh they're not continuous waves they
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
pulse when they're pulsing they're at
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
higher intensity
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh so this is all the stuff that's out
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
there that we need to get our arms
 
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.669 align:start position:0%
there that we need to get our arms
around

01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so we we chose to go with the distance
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
from new antennas
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
and not the power
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
power and i but i will agree that you
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
know we should get our arms around the
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
power density
 
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
power density
uh

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
what's an acceptable level of power
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
density of all the antennas in an area
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
because because one tower interacts with
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
another tower it's you know
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
and understand and this
 
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
and understand and this
um

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say one more thing this came
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
so saying today which was last year or
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
two years ago 154 000 cell towers today
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a quote from the ctia
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
there are 154 000 cell towers today to
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
meet growing mobile data demands and win
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
the race to 5g
 
01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:23.189 align:start position:0%
the race to 5g
projects

01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
we will need to install hundreds of
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of small cells in the next few
 
01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
thousands of small cells in the next few
years

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
sap global market intelligence projects
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
more than 800 000
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
small cells need to be deployed will be
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
wow 154 towers to 200 to 800 000.
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
not to mention
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
what spacex is setting up
 
01:19:51.199 --> 01:19:52.149 align:start position:0%
what spacex is setting up
every

01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
every day or every
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
week or two
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
they're sending up
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of satellites there's going to
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
be over 100 000 or so satellites beaming
 
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
be over 100 000 or so satellites beaming
down

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh signals
 
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.790 align:start position:0%
uh signals
so

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know call me crazy
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
i i just think we need to pause and i
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
wish this was really being discussed at
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
the national level where it should be
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
being discussed
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
but we can't even get through the
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
congressmen and senators
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
follow the money
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
the one beauty thing about new hampshire
 
01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
the one beauty thing about new hampshire
is

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't get paid off
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
especially in the house there's 400 of
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
us uh
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
no lobbyists have called me
 
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
no lobbyists have called me
uh

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
from the other side none which is good
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh they know my position but
 
01:20:42.719 --> 01:20:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh they know my position but
uh

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
i i'm just saying you know if you read
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
the whole report
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we produced
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
we have very rational
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
conclusions very rational um
 
01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:57.910 align:start position:0%
conclusions very rational um
solutions

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know from
 
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
you know from
warnings

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
warnings
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know and by the way this is only
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
about i mean the commission we did we
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
started out as 5g commission but we
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
quickly discovered we can't talk about
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
5g without talking about 3g and 4g it's
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
all it's all it's all linked together
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
and and then you can't talk about att
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
versus verizon because they have
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
different strategies
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
so you can't really put your hand around
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
it we talked about
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
intended what's inside those antennas
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
how are they configured uh i think
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative wells maybe that's a good
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
segue to him because he's he's the one
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
who really seems to know a lot about
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
that as well as
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
is dr chamberlain you know uh thank you
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative that is a good segue i
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
i think i would like to hear from the
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
honorable ken wells right now and thank
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
you i'd like to be done with this by
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
noontime so if there's anyone else that
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on this
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh please uh
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
if you give us a card just over that we
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
have a copy of your name and
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth not
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
trying to make it a formality but we do
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
no turn it on
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
that would help thank you
 
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
that would help thank you
um

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
will uh this representative be available
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
for questions later on we've also as
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
part of this bill there's a
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
self-reporting registry
 
01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
self-reporting registry
and

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest i don't have any
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
particular ideas on that but i would
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
love to hear
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
how that would work and i would hate
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
that to get pushed aside i understand
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
that you have a lot of issues to address
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
here and i just
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
would hate to see that forgotten in the
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
course of discussing the science and the
 
01:22:37.679 --> 01:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
course of discussing the science and the
politics

01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
from a bill standpoint i'm willing to
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
set that one aside
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
so we can focus on in terms of the bill
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
and go forward because there's enough
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about that in terms of how it
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
would work that i would say
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
amend that out and let's just focus on
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um yeah i'd like to start
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
out just by by clarifying some of the
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
definitions here we started out with the
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
commission looking at the 5g health
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
effects but we discovered quickly that
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
that 5g is not a physical description
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's a marketing term it means new and
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
improved okay and what we're talking
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
about here let's not talk about 5g and
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
4g or broadband
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
internet what we're talking about here
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifically is radio frequency
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
radiation okay and radio frequency
 
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
radiation okay and radio frequency
radiation

01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
can hurt you now um thank you
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative knotter for your
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
very good introduction where you talked
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
about wattages and frequency ranges of
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
the band of the spectrum
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
but there are a couple of things that
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
you left out and one is it's not just
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the power of the transmitter it's how
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
close it is okay and that that is what
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
has uh a very large effect on living
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
systems my background is in biochemistry
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and biophysics
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
and so we we heard in that introduction
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
about thermal
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
effects and ionizing radiation but
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
radio frequency will also
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
affect biomembrane potentials and what i
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
mean by biomembranes these are the
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
membranes involved in your nervous
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
system they're the membranes involved in
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
reproduction like you know you know when
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
a when an uh when an ovum is is
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
fertilized by one sperm it changes the
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
voltage on the outside of the thing so a
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
second one can't get in ordinarily
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis uses membrane potentials
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
birds and bees use it for navigation
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's involved in blood clotting and it's
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
involved in oxidation as
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
dr chamberlain
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned we don't even have to give up
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
any of the advantages of communication
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
and high speed stuff
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
when we give up a high energy high
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
density radio frequency because
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
optical fiber optics and light
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
transmitted stuff is a hundred times
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
faster so the the vested interests here
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
are the people who are making and
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
selling radio frequency stuff
 
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
selling radio frequency stuff
um

01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
we could talk a little bit about um
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the distance and the
 
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh the the distance and the
densification

01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
densification
 
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.390 align:start position:0%
densification
um

01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a well-known thing in
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
physics gauss's law tells you how much
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
the field dissipates as you back away
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
from a source okay and if it was a
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
spherical distribution same in all
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
directions you know the bigger that
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
bubble gets uh the more its area
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
increases and the same amount of energy
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
is spread over a larger area
 
01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:37.350 align:start position:0%
is spread over a larger area
however

01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
with this type of application you can
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
shape the the shape of the emissions the
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
same way you can shape the light emitted
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
from a street light you know the light
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't go straight up in outer space
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
you reflect it back down where you want
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
it now if you're going to do a
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
communications network you would reflect
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
it out as much as you could into a
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
horizontal cookie shape right
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
in that case the amount of energy is uh
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
going to be dissipated over the
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
circumference of that circle
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay 2 pi r
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
so if you are one football field away
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
from a standard transmitter
 
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
from a standard transmitter
antenna

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
antenna
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
you would get a certain amount of energy
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
we'll just call it you know a bucket
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
load of energy
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you had
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
evenly spaced antennas that same one
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
football field
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
apart there would be about six of them
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the circle around you you would get
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
six times as much exposure from those
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you have another circle that's two
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
football fields away 12 of them will fit
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
there and you get another six okay so
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
this is the thing about densification if
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
you have more and more and more and more
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
of these things and and uh
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative abrami was just talking
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
about 150 000 more of these things uh if
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the density that 5g
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
providers are advertising you know
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
they're advertising putting one down
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
every hundred meters okay um that's
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very large grid and if you
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
think of a city if you had one every
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
hundred meters in a checkerboard it's a
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
huge number of of antennas
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
they also advertise that you can
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
concentrate the field at a particular
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
point and the way you do that is these
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
antennas operate independently they have
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
an internet connection and they can
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
delay the signal so that uh they can
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
steer the beam okay and if you do that
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
you can get many many many times higher
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
energy at a certain location than you
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
even get at the transmitter right at the
 
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
even get at the transmitter right at the
antenna

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is that there are three
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
parameters here that we we need to worry
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
about and and a couple of them uh
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative knotter talked about the
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
frequency as the frequency goes up the
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
amount of energy increases
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the wattage of the
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
transmitter how bright the light bulb is
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
is another thing
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the third thing is the distance and
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
it turns out we can't control the first
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
two because those are controlled by
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
software and you know how dieselgate
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
worked right they they fiddled the
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
software so they got it to do stuff that
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't allowed to do
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to stop them from
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing that and i don't even think that
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
the companies that sell
 
01:28:06.159 --> 01:28:08.310 align:start position:0%
the companies that sell
5g

01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
5g
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
know what they're buying because they're
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
not manufacturing the stuff
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want people who
 
01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want people who
manufacture

01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
these things to put
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
capabilities in there that would expose
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
us to more of this
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
this radiation
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
dave duvet who was mentioned
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
representing bia said that the power
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
level of the transmitter is a hard
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
number to nail down and that's because
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
the if the engineers want to do it they
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
can uh make it perform within this
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
little envelope when it's being uh
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed and tested
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
and expanded to that in use same way
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
dieselgate worked
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
so we need to be careful about what we
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow in new hampshire and the only
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing we really have the only tool we
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
have is to make sure those antennas are
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
not so close together
 
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.669 align:start position:0%
not so close together
and

01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
one of my hobbies is auto racing and you
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
can get hurt in auto racing and you look
 
01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
can get hurt in auto racing and you look
at

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
what is the most likely bad thing that
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
could happen and then you
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
change your equipment and you take
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
safety precautions to make sure that bad
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
thing can't happen it's called the
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
precautionary principle and i think that
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
we should exercise a precautionary
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
principle here and uh and limit how
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
close those antennas can be to each
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
other and also to uh people
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and so um i'd be happy to uh answer any
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
further questions you have
 
01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
further questions you have
uh

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.629 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
um

01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
the honorable wells it's nice having you
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
back in here again um
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to cut your uh your time
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
short i do have a question uh if you uh
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
if we feel like we have to stay later
 
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.430 align:start position:0%
if we feel like we have to stay later
you

01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
you may stay and come back
 
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.629 align:start position:0%
you may stay and come back
um

01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
um
what

01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there's anyone here
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
from the from the
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
provider area to answer this question
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
but perhaps you can
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
minimum distance that
 
01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:04.390 align:start position:0%
minimum distance that
antennas

01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
antennas
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
need to be placed in order for them to
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
work with the data stream that that they
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
want to project in other words uh they
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
is there a distance of say maybe 10 feet
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
20 feet 100 feet 500 feet that they
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
can't be placed any closer because it it
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't serve their purpose to transmit
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
data my what i'm i'm getting at is i'm
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out from from a
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
technological point of view what's the
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
minimum distance that they that they
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
can't get any closer to otherwise
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to work yeah well
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned when you get antennas
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
very very close together you get all
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of interference reflections off of
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
buildings and things like that which
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
cause your signal to get garbled if you
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
imagine being in a room with three or
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
four radios going right it'd be hard to
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on even though
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
it get it's getting louder right and
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is we want to make
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure that that signal doesn't get so
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
loud that it hurts people okay
 
01:30:58.239 --> 01:30:59.189 align:start position:0%
loud that it hurts people okay
because

01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
as you get them very close together it
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
needs to get louder in order for the the
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
signal to get through so there's a
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
diminishing return
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
the other limitation that was mentioned
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
though is that
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
the higher frequency you go up
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh the more oxygen
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the environment absorbs the signal
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
especially water vapor remember that
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
we're three quarters water we absorb
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
this stuff too right and it's it's not
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
good for us in fact it's not just the
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
oxygen but it's all those other you know
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
biomembranes and things like that
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
will participate in what's called
 
01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
will participate in what's called
resonance

01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
resonance
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
resonance is matching the frequency of
 
01:31:34.159 --> 01:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
resonance is matching the frequency of
some

01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
something that can jiggle around a
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
molecule say and um
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
an analogy i think of is you know when
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
when we were little kids and we learned
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
how to swing a playground swing we
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
discovered you couldn't go like this
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't go you had to match
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
the frequency right when the frequencies
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
match that wave gets bigger and bigger
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and bigger until something breaks okay
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
and forms free radicals does some
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
oxidation does some other sort of side
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
reactions that are that are not good for
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
us those are the frequencies that happen
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
in this millimeter wave range
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
starting at around 600 mil megahertz and
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
coming all the way up to the to you know
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
one to three millimeters which are the
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
the frequencies that the military has
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
developed into a weapon it certainly
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
does harm so um those are the things
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh we want to attenuate
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
if we need to have wireless
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
communication that has higher data
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
transmission rates we should look at
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
light laser um it's much better safer
 
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.310 align:start position:0%
light laser um it's much better safer
technology

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
having sunlight shine on you
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
is generally not too bad
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
which brings me to one other point a lot
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
of these studies particularly older ones
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
treat radiation as if it was a toxic
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
chemical and they they
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
establish what they call an sar which is
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
how many watts per kilogram
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's irrelevant okay if you're talking
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
about how much sunburn you're going to
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
get from radiation it's watts per square
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
meter okay and so much of the of the
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
inconclusive reports that you go out
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
there are are using the wrong unit and
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the stuff that is
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
based on watts per square meter it's
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
fairly um it's fairly convincing because
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
there it's not just humans uh that are
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
affected by this uh very good study out
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
of germany that looked at tree growth
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
and the side that faces towards the tree
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
um is damaged okay and it doesn't matter
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
how it's oriented north south and all
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
that stuff they did a huge number of
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
trees and examined these things and the
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
trees are damaged uh by being uh uh
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
close to a an antenna
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the damage lessens as you get
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
further away we know that if you put a
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
cell phone that's on in a beehive it'll
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
kill the hive right um you know so birds
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
and bees pollinators
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial are affected by this
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
stuff so there is a lot of of research
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
out here that says that points out that
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh harmful and um you know if you
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
look at the 390 page report there are
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
pages and pages of citations of these
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
types of things we took 14 months and we
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of stuff
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um if i could ask uh we we're
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
getting close to our time here uh if
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
representing kelly pitts if he asks one
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
question and then i would like to
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
call on the only person that is right
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
now is would be speaking against the
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill and give that side an opportunity
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
before i move on to
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
this other person who because i've heard
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
on why we should pass the bill and all
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
that stuff and which is good we need to
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
hear that but i'd like to hear from the
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
opposing side before our time runs out
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
so one question represent kelly pitts
 
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.070 align:start position:0%
so one question represent kelly pitts
ken

01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
ken
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i'm picturing a streetscape
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
polls antennas on poles
 
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.870 align:start position:0%
polls antennas on poles
so

01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
you go a thousand feet
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
at you one an antenna what do you do
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
about the person whose house is less
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
than a thousand feet from that pole yeah
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
this is a concern because somebody who
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
has a second floor front bedroom and has
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
one on the pole may only be 30 feet away
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
transmitter and is getting really a high
 
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.709 align:start position:0%
transmitter and is getting really a high
dosage

01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
dosage
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
from that one and they are also getting
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
additional from the ones you know
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
further up and down the street and a
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
block away and all of those signals
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
overlap so yeah you get a real
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
intensification by putting lots and lots
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
of these down
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
representatives partial
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
analogy rather than swimming pools if
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
you think of lawn sprinklers okay if you
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of lawn sprinklers uh in a in
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
an area the more of them there are the
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
wetter you're gonna get and that's
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up with you later
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much if you don't
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
mind uh if i could ask um
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh mr rick fabrizio from bia to come up
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh and give him a few minutes to discuss
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
before you start talking i just want to
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
that there are some questions asked
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
before and i become
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh into some information uh the question
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
was asked about if any other state had
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
had banned 5g
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
best to our knowledge
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
no states have banned 5g at this point
 
01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.109 align:start position:0%
no states have banned 5g at this point
another

01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
and of course i'll get to this later but
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts is right the
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're preempted by federal law on
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
certain things that we can do with this
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill and we'll we'll get back to that
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
later but
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
apparently our hands could be tied in
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
some respect but we'll we'll talk about
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
that later
 
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.109 align:start position:0%
that later
um

01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
i also want to say that i'm told that
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
fcc chair rosenworthal is not a lobbyist
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
that she came that she worked as a
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
public servant for two
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
sanders on the senate commerce committee
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
before joining the fcc to
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
to democrat sanders another fcc
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner jeffrey starks is also not
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist he was an attorney for
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
doj focused on law enforcement and
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
before that focused on national security
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
before that he was an attorney at a law
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
clerk at the at the 8th circuit so
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
those are two examples that that that
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're not lobbyists at least not at the
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
time anyway um so with that being said
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh mr fabrizio please go ahead thank you
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
i am rick fabrizio i'm director of
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
communications and public policy for the
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
business and industry association
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would state that if this bill is
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
passed it would greatly slow new
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's efforts to expand broadband
 
01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire's efforts to expand broadband
throughout

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
states especially the areas that are
 
01:37:31.199 --> 01:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
states especially the areas that are
unserved

01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
unserved
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill as we all know would uh require
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
setbacks of sixteen hundred forty feet
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
um from any
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know parks playgrounds residentially
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
zoned neighborhoods hospitals nursing
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
homes day care centers and schools you
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
know if you think about that in reality
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to block the deployment of
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
cell tower telecommunication antenna
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
virtually everywhere in the state when
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
you account for the location of all of
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
those different things it used to be as
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
part of the telecommunications act of
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
1996 that highways were identified as
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
good places where you could put
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antennae but as we
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
continue to see increased residential
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
development in the state more and more
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
of these new neighborhoods are
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
encroaching on highways which again is
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to render the placement of
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antennae if not
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
possible so greatly restricted that that
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
is what would stop or
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
significantly impede the efforts to
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
expand broadband throughout the state
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
so there's discussion of you know that
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
sixteen forty that's six one hundred one
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred forty feet
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
broadband wavelength has a reach of
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
about a thousand feet again that's going
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
to render that unusable
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
for 5g is that it provides even though
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
has lesser range of the previous
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
generations is that it provides greater
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
speed and capacity that is the number
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
one need what we're talking about with
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
high speed broadband internet speed and
 
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.870 align:start position:0%
high speed broadband internet speed and
capacity

01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
now we've heard uh today and we've heard
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
previously in the committee meeting
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't fiber optic do it fiber optic is a
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
backbone of telecommunication in
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
industries but it's prohibitively
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
expensive to route it to the last mile
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
as you often hear those homes that are
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
unserved or underserved
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
so not only is it prohibitedly expensive
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
wi-fi now i'm suppo i suppose there is
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
some way in your home that you could
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
connect your phone your mobile phone
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
to directly to wi-fi but most instances
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to need something like a
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
wi-fi router in order to have your phone
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
the thing that's most troubling about
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is its lack of specifics and
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
ambiguity the bill clearly sells
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antennae that would
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
block just about everything from your
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
regular cell phone towers to your
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
distributed antennae systems that offer
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
a less power lower profile tower than to
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
the traditional towers
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
but not only would it block the
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
distributed antennae systems it would
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
also block uh public wi-fi which most
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
providers like comcast at t et cetera
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
have public wi-fi
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
antennae if you will located throughout
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
the street those would also fall under
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
this even wi-fi and buildings that we
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
see and we see so many people using
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
their phones
 
01:40:32.239 --> 01:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
their phones
tablets

01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
tablets
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
chromebooks at all
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
they would have less ability to connect
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
to it i would disagree that looking at
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
5g classifying it as you know 4g is
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
cellular and 5g is data and nobody needs
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be watching a movie while walking
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
down the street well i agree they don't
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
need to be watching a movie while
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
walking down the street i don't think
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the future of 5g is
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
providing for it's providing for high
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
speed reliable broadband internet
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it is a crucial part of bringing
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
wifi to all areas of the state
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot today and in the
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
previous testimony of research that says
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
it causes harm
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem this is part of the
 
01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem this is part of the
process

01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
there are different people's site expert
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
says it causes harm other experts say
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's not proven to cause harm in the
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
minority report of the 5g commission
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
which said that 5g poses significant
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
health to humans and the environment the
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
world health organization and the fda
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
did not support that contention
 
01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
did not support that contention
so

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
while i'm not going to forgive congress
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
or any of the other governing bodies for
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
not moving this up on their list like it
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
or not this research all has to come
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
together and be vetted
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
by an agreed upon agency which should be
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
a government agency that can take all
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
the information together and distill a
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
final report
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
because one group saying one thing and
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
one group saying another is not the
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
answer to this but we do know that the
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
state needs to continue to expand
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
broadband for economic purposes from
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
everything from telehealth to remote
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
learning to businesses the state is
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to require more and more online
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
data capacity in order for our economy
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
to continue to grow and function at the
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
level it needs to be done
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you look
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
strictly at this bill
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
on the note that it banned it would
 
01:42:29.119 --> 01:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
on the note that it banned it would
preemptively

01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
preemptively
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
ban most telecommunication new
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antennae of all
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
variety throughout the state
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
if the goal was to make sure that
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're not placed every 200 meters the
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
bill should
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
have looked at that
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
not set such strict bans that you will
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
be hard-pressed to find another location
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
for a cell for a telecommunication
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
antenna moving forward which again
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
includes all wi-fi routers i'll be
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
taking any questions uh thank you uh
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
before i take any questions i i'd like
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
read to uh to further substantiate what
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
represent kelly pittsett said before
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
about the federal communications act of
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
1996 and get your
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
your view on that
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
um from what i had
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
this comes from the fcc site
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
it says that in particular section 704
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the act states that quote
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
no state or local government or
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
instrumentality thereof
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
may regulate the placement construction
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and modification of personal wireless
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
service facilities on the basis of of
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
the environmental effects of radio
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
frequency emissions to the extent that
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
such facilities comply with the
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
commission's regulations concerning such
 
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
commission's regulations concerning such
emissions

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.669 align:start position:0%
emissions
does

01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh if if if we were to place
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
maybe no uh
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
broad restrictions but if we were to
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
even set
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh even smaller
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
with this regulation here prevent us
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
from even doing that
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
that was what i meant to mention it in
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
this period but i was kind of going off
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
the cuff it was one of my initial
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill is the fact that
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
it would run afoul of the
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
telecommunications act which part of the
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
reason why it was created was to
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
facilitate an agreed upon acceptable
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
placement of telecommunication antennae
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
i would think that this law as it stands
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
would be at odds with the federal
 
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.070 align:start position:0%
would be at odds with the federal
regulation

01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
i have i have two questions one was uh
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
the federal telecommunications act but
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.109 align:start position:0%
we also have
local

01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
zoning in this
 
01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:50.149 align:start position:0%
zoning in this
state

01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
where zoning boards and local
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh people and at one point i believe
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
some towers way back in the beginning
 
01:44:58.159 --> 01:44:59.189 align:start position:0%
some towers way back in the beginning
were

01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
can local boards still regulate the
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
placement of towers and i'm going to
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
just follow up with the second question
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
really quickly is that
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the cost of price
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that fiber is much more expensive
 
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
and we know that a company certain
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
company left because they didn't want to
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
do fiber
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
or expand fiber
 
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.030 align:start position:0%
or expand fiber
what

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
the criteria for expanding broadband one
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the criteria is affordability
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
so would 5g roll out
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
be more affordable
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i mean these are the federal
 
01:45:42.239 --> 01:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
and i mean these are the federal
criteria

01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
with not being an expert on it but
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that if you
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
do the research on fiber optive
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
fiber optic it's very expensive and then
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
when you factor in the companies are
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
putting them in putting it in if you put
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
in fiber optic in an urban area where
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
say manchester 110 000 people that cost
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
per person goes down if you're looking
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to run fiber optic to the rural parts of
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state where you might have
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
five homes per mile
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
that beca that's when it really becomes
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive because the service
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
providers cannot possibly justify that
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
type of per household cost because the
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
numbers the houses are so far they're
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
separated and there's so many few of
 
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
separated and there's so many few of
them

01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
um fiber optic is a backbone of it but
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
again i i would say that
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
you have to have wireless for the phones
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the tablets and everything else to
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
connect if you look at the internet of
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
things in five years more and more
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
you'll have smart refrigerators
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
completely controlled heating systems
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
all this is a wi-fi based thing and yes
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
that itself can tie into fiber optic but
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
fiber optic
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't right now really bridge the gap
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
to wireless but again most importantly
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
it goes back to it's very cost
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to deliver the last mile of
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up is that so the
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
construction of these small towers
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
every i don't know how many feet
 
01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.510 align:start position:0%
every i don't know how many feet
uh

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be far less inexpensive
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
even though
 
01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.669 align:start position:0%
even though
[Music]

01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal money is working the grant for
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
this delivering fiber optic to the last
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
mile to those rural areas where you
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a density of housing is going
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
to be cost prohibitive
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you were to rely on the federal
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
funding you're going to chew through
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
that federal funding a lot more quickly
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
if your end goal is to deliver fiber
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
optic to every house in unserved
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
underserved rural areas
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
represent partial
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you again um
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
as a recent recipient of high-speed
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
fiber in my house i've watched my own
 
01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:58.070 align:start position:0%
fiber in my house i've watched my own
bill

01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.189 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
decreased by greater than half
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
my thanks to a bill passed by the house
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
originating the senate passing the house
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have the ability now to go to our
 
01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
we have the ability now to go to our
municipalities

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
and working bonding with our local and
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
net companies we are able to go that
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
last mile at an affordable price
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm really wondering if this uh
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
prohibitive expense is really that
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
prohibitive when i've seen my own bill
 
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.510 align:start position:0%
prohibitive when i've seen my own bill
drop

01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
drop
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as my telephone works i am
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
very very happy that i can finally pick
 
01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:28.310 align:start position:0%
very very happy that i can finally pick
up

01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
because i have a wi-fi router i can
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
finally hook up my cell phone to get a
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
voice over internet protocol which i was
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
not able to get before because i was
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
lying up on a cell phone service
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
i find my fiber optic to be of a high
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
caliber high
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
high quality product i really
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about broadband as far
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
as what we uh have for uh
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
cellular broadband has to function right
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
now by definition around 50 megabytes
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
per second
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
and while
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
the claim is that 5g is able to do that
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
i believe they are if they were able to
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
densify their towers enough
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of getting that 50g i really
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
would question most most 5g towers are
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
not putting out nearly that rate so i i
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i find myself
 
01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
i guess i find myself
conflicted

01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
conflicted
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
i would say for sure this isn't an
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
either or approach to broadband you're
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
not going to get there all with fiber
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
optic you're not going to get there all
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
with wireless this is a composite
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
of using all the different technologies
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
to increase broadband access and to
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
allow for the increased capacity and
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
increase speed because even what's being
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
installed now
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
will have a
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
shelf life because the amount of data
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of online life you know
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
business shopping banking
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
entertainment you name it is
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
increasingly going online the state has
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to move forward to make sure
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
that it has a proper
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet infrastructure and
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
as my written testimony had presented
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
before that it's really not unlike
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
railroads in the 1800s and highways in
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
the 1900s or the advent in the
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
deployment of electricity it's not
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
unlike that for economic development
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's crucially important and again i
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
would warn that this bill poses a threat
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
to that investment because again i don't
 
01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
see where you're going to cite a new
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antennae which
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
includes the full size towers the
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
distributed antennae systems even public
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
wi-fi i don't know where you place those
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
with such strict limits
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
i realize
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
there's probably more questions to be
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
asked of view but if if i would i would
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
like to get the next speaker in before
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh noontime
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
if we as if the subcommittee decides
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
that we need to come back after lunch we
 
01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:01.510 align:start position:0%
that we need to come back after lunch we
can

01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think we have this room
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh we can decide that after we break for
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
lunch i said well no we'll decide before
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
we break for lunch if we need to come
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
back again but in the meantime let me
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
ask um
 
01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
ask um

you're welcome to stay around we may
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon or good morning still
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is cecilia ducette i
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
am the education services director for
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
an international non-profit called
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
wireless education i am also the
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
director of massachusetts for safe
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
technology and like most of you i had no
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
idea that there was anything to worry
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
about with wireless in fact for eight
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
years i ran campaigns for our public
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
schools when we were hearing about the
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
21st century classroom and how our kids
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
were going to need to have ipads
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
chromebooks wireless infrastructure so i
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
was on the wrong side of this and then
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
one night at book group my girlfriend
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
wendy who's an electrical engineer
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
tipped me off that there could be
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
biological harm
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
so i am a technical and professional
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
writer by trade so i just started
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
looking for the science which is what
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire commission so
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
dutifully did
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
report so really i hope you will all
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
look at this over the next week very
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
seriously over the weekend i sent you
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
all three separate emails the first one
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
gives the back story on how rep abrami
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
came into this topic the second one
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
talks about the report itself and so i
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
want to tell you who was on that
 
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
want to tell you who was on that
commission

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know your colleagues here engineers
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
but we also had
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
dr gary woods a medical doctor we had dr
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
tom sherman a medical doctor
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
we had denise riccardi who is now
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
senator denise riccardi who fought off
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
cell towers in her town she's a wealth
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
of information we also had dr kent
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
chamberlain we had
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
former representative wells who has as
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know a scientific background and we
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
also had dr paul heru
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
who is one of the world's leading
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
radiation scientists in fact he has
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
created cancer in his lab from this
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
radio frequency and he was coming down
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
from mcgill university where he teaches
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
electromagnetics so
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is the first time in our country
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
that any qualified board has looked at
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
this issue so please
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is our nation's leading document
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
today because our federal agencies have
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
when you look at that minority report
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
you will find a lot of information in
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
there that looks really good but what
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing is the truth the whole
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
truth and nothing but the truth so i
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
just want to point you to a few bullet
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
just want to point you to a few bullet
items

01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
they give assurances that you have to
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
have heat to have harm well as our
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
experts here have told you we have great
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
harm happening at the non-thermal level
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
they also reference the ieee or the
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
institute for electronics and electrical
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
engineers which is a wonderful
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
profession but with all due respect they
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
are not medical doctors and they are not
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
emf scientists and as rep abrami stated
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
he tried to get them to the table but
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
they had nobody to bring
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
you should also know that the industry
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
references dr jeffrey shorin at the fda
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
dr shurin is married to a partner in a
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
law firm that represents the wireless
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
industry he should have been nowhere
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
near our government studies on radio
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
frequency radiation
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
the industry will also indicate the
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
american cancer society says there's no
 
01:54:53.679 --> 01:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
american cancer society says there's no
harm

01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
but our government completed a 30
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
million dollar study it's the largest
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
study the us national toxicology program
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
has ever completed on any toxin and they
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
are the gold standard in the world on
 
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.629 align:start position:0%
are the gold standard in the world on
toxins

01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
toxins
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
after an unprecedented three-day peer
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
review at the national institutes of
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
health with world leading experts
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
weighing in
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
in their final report they conclude
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
clear evidence
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
of cancerous tumors and dna damage among
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
other findings clear evidence is the
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
highest of five categories that they can
 
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.950 align:start position:0%
highest of five categories that they can
assign

01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
assign
 
01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
so this is not to be taken lightly we do
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
have conclusive causation now that we
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have back in 2011 when the world
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
health organization classified this as a
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
group 2b possible human carcinogen
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
now the industry when a good study comes
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
out will try to counter that and say oh
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's just one study you need more than
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
that to prove it well right on the heels
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
of the u.s national toxicology program
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
study the ramazzini institute in italy
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
completed another very large study that
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
corroborated the findings of cancer and
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
dna damage that we had here
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
and the american cancer society said
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is paradigm shifting good science
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
so what we thought we knew before
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
you should also know that the american
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
cancer society is reporting sharp rises
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now in colon cancers and rectal
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
cancers among young adults at the very
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
spots where they're tucking their
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
devices into their waistbands and into
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
their back pockets and where they're
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
holding their tablets
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
and their ipads their chromebooks so you
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to take everything the industry
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
says with a grain of salt and then go to
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
the independent scientific experts for
 
01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.030 align:start position:0%
the independent scientific experts for
answers

01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
the world health organization
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
you need to know that there are two
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
groups looking at electromagnetic fields
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
at the world health organization one is
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
very heavily industry funded the other
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
is independent scientists
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
after the u.s and the italian studies
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
produced the animal studies that were
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
missing back in 2011 when they declared
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
it a group to be possible human
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
carcinogen we now have those the who has
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
reopened their investigation in 2020 and
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years they're
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be weighing in on this but
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
the question remains will it be
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
a stacked
 
01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:30.629 align:start position:0%
a stacked
agency

01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
project again with industry
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and as for the gentleman you recog
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
referenced with ichnerp the
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
international commission on non-ionizing
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
radiation protection that is also a very
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
heavily industry funded group
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we need to know who we're getting our
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
information from
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
the industry will also tell us the
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
cancer rates are going down but again
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
when we look at certain cancer rates
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
like brain tumors francis have
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
quadrupled where we're holding a cell
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
phone to our head in england the
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
incidence of these glioblastoma
 
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.589 align:start position:0%
incidence of these glioblastoma
multiforma

01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
multiforma
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
these are the deadliest types of tumors
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
they have more than doubled
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
in india brain tumors in children and
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
adults are increasing
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the industry tends to focus on
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
cancer outcomes because that takes the
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
longest to develop but there are many
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
many very serious health effects
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
including infertility they've taken male
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
human sperm
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
exposed it to a laptop with the antennas
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
turned on
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
it changed the dna it slowed the
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
motility and it caused far fewer sperm
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be viable in just four hours of
 
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.870 align:start position:0%
to be viable in just four hours of
exposure

01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's actually the set of studies that
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
got me on my feet and gave me the
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
courage to speak up because we had just
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
given my college age daughter a laptop
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
to go to college with we had just given
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
my high school age daughter
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
a laptop to go to high school with and
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
where are they both using it but right
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
on top of their reproductive organs and
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
we now have studies from kaiser
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
permanente and others that show
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
increased miscarriage rates with women
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
who are using radio frequency
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
communication devices
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
so when the industry starts discussing
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
these 5g millimeter waves they once
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
again turn to the ieee for their
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
expertise those are not doctors or
 
01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.070 align:start position:0%
expertise those are not doctors or
scientists

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
and in fact the ieee
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
has already put out some studies that
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
indicate yes there are biological
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
effects so again every time the industry
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
tells you something that makes you think
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
you want to believe what they're saying
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
dig deeper
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
in february of 2019 u.s senator richard
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
blumenthal called out the fcc in a a
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal commerce hearing
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
and he said to them so please share with
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
us how much money have you invested
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
for independent science to prove that 5g
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
is safe
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
before we roll this out
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
and both of those industry
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
representatives had to fess up that they
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't know of any safety testing that
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
has been done on this
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
so we should not be putting this into
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
when you talk about before and after i
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
want to share with you that back in 2019
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
when rep abrami first introduced
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
his house bill 522 that led to this law
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
and this was the first law on the land
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
to form a commission and to look at this
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
we were invited to come in in the
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
morning when the industry
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
representatives were giving their pitch
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
on how come new hampshire should get on
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
the bandwagon and do what boston has
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
done and get all this new wireless
 
02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
done and get all this new wireless
infrastructure

02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
well i want to tell you what's happened
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
in boston
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
so this is a radio frequency radiation
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
detection meter and it's hard because
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
these are invisible waves we can't get
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
our mind around it
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
but when i turn this on
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
we will get an ambient reading in this
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
room and you know it's a little dummy
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
proof for those of us who don't know the
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
numbers or the science that well
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
we know
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
green yellow red right right here in
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
this room just the ambient environment
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
is hitting a peak of 2530
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter and it's
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
that peak that we need to be very much
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
aware of because that's what's damaging
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
our cells so don't listen to any
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
industry averages it's the spike the
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
spiked erratic pulse of microwave
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
radiation that is harming ourselves but
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
i want to show you what happens when i
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
take my cell phone out of airplane mode
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i get an active signal
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
i'm now at
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
114 000
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter i went in i
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the folks who held on to her
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
3g phone
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i had to go back to the store
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
because i got the letter that said
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to discontinue 3g
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i got to chatting with a couple of
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
guys at the store and
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
i said do you guys want to know why i'm
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
asking if i can hardwire the replacement
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
phone and it was slow that day so we
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
chit-chatted and
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
one of the kids pulled out his new 5g
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
phone and when i measured it with the
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
antennas on for 5g it went over a
 
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:42.790 align:start position:0%
antennas on for 5g it went over a
million

02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
in our sleeping areas the science
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
indicates we should be at 0.1
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the outdoor areas they recommend a
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
thousand or less and that's presuming
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
that you get to go home
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
and allow your body the proper space to
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
detoxify in your own private setting if
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
you put a cell tower outside of
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
somebody's home their body is never
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to be able to catch up and then
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
you see this whole downstream effect and
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know when you go out and you look at
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
the official websites from our captured
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
agencies or from ichner
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
what you will see is information to give
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
you a false sense of security but the
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
science has progressed and we know of at
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
least eight different ways
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
that this radiation damages our
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
biological cells
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
our experts here have talked about
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
oxidative stress they've talked about
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
the free radicals we've talked about
 
02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.310 align:start position:0%
the free radicals we've talked about
infertility

02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
infertility
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
we should also know about the rouleau
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
effect so
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is a magnetic field our red blood
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
cells are meant to be free floating and
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
bringing oxygen to all of our systems
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
when we are exposed to radio frequency
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
radiation it can cause our blood cells
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
to glom up and i remember the the rulo
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
effect because when i was a kid i like
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
those candies called rolos that are
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
stacked up
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
so instead of free floating
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
our red blood cells start
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
flowing up
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
into this chain that can then no longer
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
get to where it needs to bring oxygen
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
to our major organs and every cell in
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
our body so oxidative stress
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
and the roulette effect are very very
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
critically important and we know that in
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
a controlled
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
medical setting we can do really good
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
things with this technology we can
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
stimulate stem cell growth we can
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
stimulate bone cell growth but in this
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled way
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the industry has convinced us that
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
while all wi-fi all the time is the way
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
there's no control and there's no escape
 
02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
from it
 
02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:55.109 align:start position:0%
from it
so

02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
as much as we've been told that we have
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
to have wireless our experts here are on
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
the right path when they tell us that we
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
should invest as much as we can in
 
02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
should invest as much as we can in
hard-wired

02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
hard-wired
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
fiber or high-speed cable or copper to
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
and through
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
the premises my house completely
 
02:05:15.679 --> 02:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
the premises my house completely
hardwired

02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
hardwired
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
not hard to do you put an ethernet cable
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
you put an ethernet jack you buy little
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
adapters and you hook it all up you
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
might have to give up a little
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
convenience maybe you can't walk into
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
the bathroom with your cell phone
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
right or put an ethernet jack in your
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
bathroom and just plug it in
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
but dr timothy sheckley with the
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
national institute for science law and
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
has a wonderful resource for you called
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
reinventing wires the future of land
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
lines and networks wi-fi is great for
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
wi-fi is not sustainable when we have
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
natural disasters look what happened if
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the fire is out in california
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
people could not get a call out because
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
the cell towers had burnt down those who
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
still had hardwired land lines could get
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
emergency response so it's a very very
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
serious misstep when we allow the
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
industry to talk us out of maintaining
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
the landlines
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
so i hope you will take that very much
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
to heart and as far as the legalities of
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
this i would direct you to americans for
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
responsible technology this is a
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
non-profit award-winning group
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
they've received awards from the
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency for the
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
incredible they work work they do to try
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
and protect our children
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
they have taken best practices from
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
around the country that have upheld
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
in courts of law
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
the industry will tell you it's coming
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you can do about it that
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
telecom act makes it so you can't say
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
anything about where you want to put
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
these but that's simply not true
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
congress preserved our local municipal
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
rights to a degree
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
and so i won't go into detail here but
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that our towns can do
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
starting with don't put wireless
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
communication facilities in residential
 
02:07:10.159 --> 02:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
communication facilities in residential
areas

02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you can do it and get you know cover
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
the gap in coverage
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
put them in industrial complexes 300
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
feet up in the air where they're
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
do not put them in our school yards do
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
not put them on our hospitals do not put
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
them on our senior centers and don't put
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
them on our playing grounds either
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it's all out there and i am telling
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
you this report has done an incredible
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
job of making your job easy they spent a
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
year and a half on this i know you guys
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
only have a week
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
but they have done their job and i am
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
asking that you support
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
the hard work that went on before this
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee reconvened
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
and were you able to distribute these to
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
your full board
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
i did uh give them out to be distributed
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
i assume everyone got one yes yeah so
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
this is an excellent way just to share
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
with your family share with your loved
 
02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:08.390 align:start position:0%
with your family share with your loved
ones

02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
what this invisible toxin is
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then just you know start taking your
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
baby steps at home i can be brought in
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
to do training sessions i've already
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
been brought into the keene public
 
02:08:19.679 --> 02:08:21.109 align:start position:0%
been brought into the keene public
library

02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
library
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
i was brought into
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
taylor community center with the senior
 
02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
taylor community center with the senior
citizens

02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
and i give talks all over the country
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
all over the world and just step
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
everybody through this because once we
 
02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:35.589 align:start position:0%
everybody through this because once we
know

02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
what these risks are
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's just common sense to choose safe
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
sustainable technology wireless is not
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
sustainable it's just not hardwire
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
fiber to and through the premises will
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
last for years and years and it will
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
adapt with technology you're not going
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
to have to keep reinvesting
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
like they want us to do with all of our
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
wireless devices so
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time i know it's a
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
lot to get your arms around in a short
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
amount of time but if there's anything i
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
can do to help
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know help you connect those dots i
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be so honored
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
okay my uh my question to the
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is
 
02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.069 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is
um

02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
do do you want there's there's at least
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
one other speaker coming up do you want
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
to cover that you want a lunch break do
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
you think we need to come back for some
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
more discussion
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
for more than say 15-20 minutes or do
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
you want to take care of this last
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
speaker and then we can talk about
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
whether we need to come back again this
 
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
whether we need to come back again this
week

02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
represent partial
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to defer to your judgment
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
however um
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
i am wondering there was a discuss the
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh splitting this uh
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill into two
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
sections one addressing the placement of
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
cell towers the other the registry
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if we want to address
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
that as part of this committee as well
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
and again i'll refer to your judgment on
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
all of this yeah i um
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i didn't hear that um
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
i um
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
not sure we had the time
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh to go into that you know splitting a
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill is is gonna be very difficult i
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
to my recollection said he wouldn't mind
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating that registry part of the
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill for right now
 
02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.109 align:start position:0%
bill for right now
yes

02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
right that could certainly be one of our
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
options that that we can discuss i think
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
for right now let's i believe
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh mr robert uh michelle roberge is here
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
and let's continue with her you would
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
like to hang around may i just make one
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
more comment
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have developed online training for
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
schools and families and for the
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
corporate workplace that can be
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
completed online off the shelf in about
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
a half an hour
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic we had given every
 
02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic we had given every
child

02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
a wireless device to access
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
their education with absolutely no
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
safety testing
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
no safety training
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
and you know that those kids are
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
sleeping with those tablets
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and this is extraordinarily biologically
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
harmful so regardless of what you do
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
we need to get education out to our
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
families immediately
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
and our non-profit would be honored to
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
give you the licensing to protect the
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
children in new hampshire and elsewhere
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:48.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief today
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
my name is michelle roberge and i'm the
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
administrator of the bureau of public
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
health protection within the division of
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
public health at the department of
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to remind the
 
02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.669 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to remind the
committee

02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on this bill
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we do have some concerns related to
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
the registry and i know some of you had
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
a few questions there is a fiscal impact
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the registry component of it and i
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to just note that there is no
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority within the language
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill or an appropriation to
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
support the registry and that's really
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
our our
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
our only concern is if we're asked to do
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
this registry that there is no
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation and there's no rule making
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we filed a fiscal note and we also
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
provided testimony during the public
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing as well thank you uh would we
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that there is going to
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
be a public hearing continuation on this
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill i believe on february 7th in the
 
02:13:13.119 --> 02:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
bill i believe on february 7th in the
morning

02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
to take care of the speakers i think
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
that didn't get a chance to speak if if
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'm correct on that and then there'll be
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
an exact session in in the afternoon so
 
02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:26.550 align:start position:0%
an exact session in in the afternoon so
yeah

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yes you're right one o'clock
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i'll have to double check on that i
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be a public
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
hearing done
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
right i know i can't be here in the
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
morning but i'll be here in the
 
02:13:55.199 --> 02:13:56.629 align:start position:0%
morning but i'll be here in the
afternoon

02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:13:56.639 --> 02:13:59.910 align:start position:0%
afternoon
so

02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh so my question to the
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee now is
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
do you see a need to come back this
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon for more discussion amongst us
 
02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
afternoon for more discussion amongst us
or

02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
we could
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll check and see if we're able to
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee meeting maybe
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
this thursday if it's if it's allowable
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if who's available
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
what's your favorite what's the
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
turn on
 
02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
how is the subcommittee going to make a
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation if we don't discuss it
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
that that's all i want to say
 
02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:46.149 align:start position:0%
that that's all i want to say
availability

02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
02:14:47.599 --> 02:14:49.669 align:start position:0%
we're here
um

02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
can we have
 
02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
you know 15 20 minutes and not have to
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a lunch at 12 30. sure
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm asking you know we can
 
02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm asking you know we can
yeah

02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
that would be fine with me i know
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's another hearing going on at one
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the state house
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
but how can we make a recommendation
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
the results of any given study depends
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
largely upon who pays for the study and
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
i always keep that in mind
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
and there's so much conflicting
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
information out there it's like who do
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
we believe you've got one set of
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
scientists that says this you got this
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
one set of scientists it says that
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
who's to say that this side is correct
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
and this side is wrong
 
02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
because again who pays for the study and
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's take climate the climate we have
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
one set of scientists that says we're in
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
a climate crisis we're all going to die
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
and then i learned that there's tens of
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of scientists worldwide that
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
that say we're not in a climate crisis
 
02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
that say we're not in a climate crisis
and

02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
they don't get any credence because they
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't go along with what an
 
02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:59.270 align:start position:0%
don't go along with what an
administration

02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.390 align:start position:0%
administration
decided

02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
decided
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
is true
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
therefore they're canceled so
 
02:16:06.550 --> 02:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
we had the commission and
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
they spent a year and a half but
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
i don't want to use the word stacked
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
because it sounds doesn't sound nice but
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
but it was because the other side wasn't
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
part of it for whatever reason
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i i just i'm having a really hard
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
time with this because
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
we have to think about new hampshire as
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
a whole and we can't just
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
stop industry on
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
when there's still information out there
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
from studies that say that
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's inconclusive
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
and if when in doubt throw it out i
 
02:16:38.559 --> 02:16:39.509 align:start position:0%
and if when in doubt throw it out i
don't

02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
represent white do you have any comments
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard from you for a while uh
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
so my main concerns around this were the
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
the financial aspect if we can if we can
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
go closer oh sorry my main
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
concerns were around the uh
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million over three years that's
 
02:16:57.679 --> 02:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million over three years that's
ridiculous

02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
so if we get rid of that and only focus
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
the tower location piece of it um
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain uh honestly i i want to
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
dive into the report that and all the
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
studies that are that the report
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
references so i need like i don't know
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
60 hours no sleep
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have 60 hours unfortunately
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
represent cali pits i
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
like to see this subcommittee recommend
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
to the full committee that this go into
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
i think we do not know
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
i mean there's so much conflict we we
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
something is going on are we going to
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
stop industry no
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
industry will march on an industry
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a federal roll out
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
all these things are coming
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
there's also an rsa where we gave up
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh control of the tele telecommunication
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
industry that we did in new hampshire as
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
well as the
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
the act
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
but i would like to delve
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
more into exactly what's happening
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and come to a fair conclusion we heard
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
majority one side of this whole story
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to read that report
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then i would like to
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
go with the other side of the story i
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
know canada has just done a roll out
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
well what does roll out mean there's all
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't have answers to them i did
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
go by where i used to work in portsmouth
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
and look at this
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
humongous tower that seems to have grown
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
up next to the senior citizens
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
department as oh wait a minute
 
02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:46.389 align:start position:0%
department as oh wait a minute
um

02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
so i think i think at this point the
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation if that's possible
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to see interim study and
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
forget the amendment for now we because
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
if we go into interim we can we can take
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
that out at any time
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
the registry part
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
and just look into what the consequences
 
02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:08.790 align:start position:0%
and just look into what the consequences
of

02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
this new rollout is going to be okay
 
02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:12.790 align:start position:0%
this new rollout is going to be okay
uh

02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
what represent parts do you have
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
02:19:16.319 --> 02:19:17.429 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
um

02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes i think that right where i'm sitting
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now that i feel like i could have
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
my mind changed i've seen this bill as
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
something that ought to pass
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
as long as
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
as a rep said with white said we could
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
remove that one part about the self
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
reporting registry i think we're opening
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
a can of worms with that
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
but i think there's enough
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
enough information right now that we can
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead and
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill to ought to pass and
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
we can always go back and revisit it
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
later on if we are concerned about
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
stifling industry in the state of new
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think it's a more
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
conservative approach
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we've heard a good amount of
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
textimony today about the dangers of emf
 
02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:57.349 align:start position:0%
textimony today about the dangers of emf
radiation

02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
many of the people are speaking of it
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
are only are speaking from uh the
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyists they have something to make
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
from this we're seeing private citizens
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
come forward and say
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have a vested interest in the
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
project itself but they have concerns
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i think that's so i would say that i
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
would recommend this without one
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
abutment as an otp
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
well if we did the amendment it would be
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
an otpa but but um
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm not so sure that we we want
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
to go that route per se
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
i i do like the thought of the interim
 
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.590 align:start position:0%
i i do like the thought of the interim
study

02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:36.630 align:start position:0%
study
because

02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
whichever way we go we would need more
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
time to formulate
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
a proper response
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be opposed to the interim
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
study on that representative i agree
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
with um what rep representative kelly
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
pitts said and you normally i don't
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm against studies to become what are
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
you going to study you got to study the
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
study but there there is another side to
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
the whole issue and there's there is
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
more to study it would give us at least
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
time to formulate some type of perhaps
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh instead of just trying
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
to secure it this week representative
 
02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:11.190 align:start position:0%
to secure it this week representative
white

02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
white
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
so if we refer this to interim study
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what's the timeline
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
look like i i'm not really sure how that
 
02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:18.550 align:start position:0%
look like i i'm not really sure how that
works

02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:20.150 align:start position:0%
works
normally

02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
normally
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
interim study during the second year of
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
a biennium
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
normally they're used to sometimes just
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
make a bill go away but i would not want
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
that to happen in this case we would
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
have the authorization to schedule
 
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.710 align:start position:0%
have the authorization to schedule
another

02:21:34.710 --> 02:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
another
um

02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
um
study

02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh on this i i'm not sure if the
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be it's probably a
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee involved with the interim
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
study on that but we could it's possible
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
we could also schedule a full committee
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
work session too
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
so we have those options available to us
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to a chairman votes to
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
decide on um on on how he wants to go
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
with that but here as a subcommittee we
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
could recommend
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
to the full committee that we that we do
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
interim study and the full committee
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
would vote on that and should it pass
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
then uh we would i don't even think we
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
have i don't even that doesn't even come
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
up for a vote before the full house it
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
just goes into interim study in which
 
02:22:15.439 --> 02:22:16.389 align:start position:0%
just goes into interim study in which
case

02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
both vo's and i would be responsible for
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
us to schedule the next meetings for you
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
know for the study
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay pitts do we
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
do we have to vote
 
02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
do we have to vote
on

02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is this this is an early bill
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
no this is not an early bill it's not an
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
early bill is it
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't think it was it it has an fn
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
quickly yeah it's an early bill because
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the second part of the bill because
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
it mentioned in the fiscal note ftes and
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
stuff like that
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
i did talk to the speaker about it i
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
said can the committee just if they
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
amend it out it's still going to have to
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
go to the floor
 
02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
go to the floor
and

02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
no i i i i i it's it's it has to be
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
voted out next week but we can recommend
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
yes and and absolutely and the committee
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
would vote on that and i i i don't
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
believe interim study comes up before
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the it does it on the floor but that's
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay i was told listen if this is the
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
will of the group
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
i i would support interim study as long
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
as it's not at
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the uh polite death okay yeah no no we i
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
i i definitely want to have another
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
study at least if for no other reason
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of formulating either an
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment a proper amendment
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
my personal feeling is i i just don't
 
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
my personal feeling is i i just don't
think

02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
i just don't think there's enough
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
evidence to to stay with the the
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
distance factor as stated there might be
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
a compromise here somewhere i don't know
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the registry
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have i would
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
support it if
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
the goal of the of the of these
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
let's not call it this continuation of
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
is basically what we're talking about
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think you find members who are i'm
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
sure we're gonna you can find at least
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
seven members or more that would be
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
interested in continuing this
 
02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:10.710 align:start position:0%
interested in continuing this
conversation

02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm gonna suggest is that
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
what cc doucet just handed i'll hand it
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
out to you to have a copy of each one of
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
you this may be a good starting point as
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
to how do we
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
what can we do because yes we all are
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
all against up against the 1996
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
telecommunication act we know that
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
it was became a question to me whether
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was bold enough to take on
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh and we had i was i was going to see
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
what would happen here if i was going to
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
go to the governor and say
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
would you even sign this
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
and because realizing that we would have
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
to take on the federal government
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
because that'll cost the state money to
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
to battle that out
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
but i think here with this what's what's
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
here is a good starting point for the
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
how do we craft this so that we can keep
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
our citizens safer empower
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
ability to empower our municipalities
 
02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:03.270 align:start position:0%
ability to empower our municipalities
more

02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
within the structure of
 
02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.150 align:start position:0%
within the structure of
of

02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a better approach
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know you know i i can see i
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
can see the writing on the wall that's
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
why i'm saying what i'm saying here
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes there's a lot of open questions
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to absorb all this
 
02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:18.550 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to absorb all this
information

02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
again i've concluded in my mind there is
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is this
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns are very real
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
but i think there's some things we can
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
do as a state
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
that would not put us at loggerheads
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the um with the federal government
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
i mean we could go with loggerheads
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
there were some openings because of the
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
court cases that i mentioned
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
and there are future court cases coming
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
up that are going to hopefully expose
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
this whole thing for what it is
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
but uh for the time being if it's an
 
02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
interim study and if we really and i i
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'd love to join you
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
in that effort
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i can bring any experts you want the
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
other side can bring experts that you
 
02:25:58.479 --> 02:25:59.429 align:start position:0%
other side can bring experts that you
want

02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
and represent an honor
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
we gave ctia every opportunity to bring
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
in as many witnesses as they wanted to
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
they brought in one fellow from the
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
university of swanson
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
from university of pittsburgh
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
who was clearly
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
paid big money to be there
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
and did not give us
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
any studies to the reverse of it you
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
know it was it was unbelievable all the
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
other people we gave him a chance and i
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
said to i said to her
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
i i said to uh
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
i'm losing her name now uh
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
bet uh cooley
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
i said
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
give us give us your best shot bring in
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
more people i want to hear from them
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know and they didn't produce anybody
 
02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
you know and they didn't produce anybody
else

02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i you know it isn't like we didn't
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
try we did try
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh to to bring in more of the other side
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why we had
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
we purposely in the bill we we say that
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted industry people there
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
just so we can have that real true
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
dialogue on this and i hope when we
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
continue the discussion in the interim
 
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
study that the industry does does
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
produce some people
 
02:27:09.359 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
produce some people
but

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
anyway i'll leave with that but i'm
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
gonna hand these out before you leave
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
just so uh just so some people here uh
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
understand my understanding
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
if we if we uh as a subcommittee here uh
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
vote to recommend interim study and our
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee votes to have interim study
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
that will
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
result in a study
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
but the the results from the interim
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
study will only produce a
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation of what could be
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
submitted as a bill in the next biennium
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
so it'll have so you'll have to wait
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
another cycle for any thing to happen
 
02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
another cycle for any thing to happen
so

02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's how how that works
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes and and i think this is a
 
02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
situation where i think it's well worth
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
having additional study like i said for
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
no other reason but to formulate a
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
proper wording for either uh
 
02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
proper wording for either uh
an

02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
amendment or a new bill or whatever we
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
want to recommend on that i think we
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time right now to
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
another parliamentary question
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
if this was amended
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
and went to the floor
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
could we recommend tabling and then if
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
we wanted to use the rest of this
 
02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:30.070 align:start position:0%
we wanted to use the rest of this
season

02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
season
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
bring it back off the table
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
the table just another
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
right tabling is an option i
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
think if it's done
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
i forget the timeline but there's a
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
certain timeline where you'd have to
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
have a two-thirds majority to take it
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
off the table um i don't think we're
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
you answer that question that question
 
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
you answer that question that question
only

02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
the uh what happens after crossover then
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a two-thirds vote to
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
get it off the table
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
which will be hard to do
 
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
which will be hard to do
right

02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh i would also recommend that if we if
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
we go into that we we try to
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
get the ear of
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
some senators to find out what their
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
thoughts might be on that because
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
it would uh it would help yes
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes good to see you
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the committee so i kept my
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
mouth shut through most of this and you
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't play one on tv either do you yeah
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
what po say you don't play one on tv
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
either do you what
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
people like a rep
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
anyway it crossed my mind when the
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of table came up is that this
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
is an early bill and so you have to do
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
something with it okay
 
02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
something with it okay
okay

02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
my apologies i i knew there were some
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
bills out there that were fns that we
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
had that were not early bills i didn't i
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
forgotten this one was so
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill though
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
i could be very much in favor of interim
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
study if that's what the majority of us
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
feel however my concern with interim
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
study is that the fcc has already
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
asserted its authority in this area
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
and without something like this
 
02:30:10.479 --> 02:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
and without something like this
intervening

02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
intervening
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
could we expect them to continue to
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
assert their authority
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
well with no action being done right now
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
there the industry will forge your head
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure okay that's that's my only
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
concern with interim studies opposed
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have timelines from the
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
industry what is rollout meat there is
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
some 5g around
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we really don't know that
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
and is it within the next six months
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
i probably think so within the next six
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
six months to a year but we don't have
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
any information like that that that's
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
really crucial that's true and even if
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
we did
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommend otpa and even if we
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
voted recognition recommendation otpa
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and even if it did pass the house
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
it would still have to wait and go to
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
the senate and go through their
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
deliberation and it's
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
possible they could
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
not approve it or if they did you still
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
have until at least what june at least
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
before it got to the governor's desk and
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
then there's a possibility of whether it
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be signed or not so the time limit
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
is far down the future anyway so while
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's going on
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent the industry
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
from forging ahead with with what
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
but there's also nothing to prevent the
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
industry which really just
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
it makes me distraught from coming and
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
talking to us and sitting down
 
02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
talking to us and sitting down
and

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
truly discussing this not just in a pub
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
but discussing this with us like we
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
called stakeholders together before and
 
02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
called stakeholders together before and
and

02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
understood what was going on and what
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
their timelines were and what our
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
timelines were and are there any
 
02:31:54.319 --> 02:31:55.670 align:start position:0%
timelines were and are there any
compromise

02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the 1600 feet is too much
 
02:31:58.960 --> 02:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the 1600 feet is too much
maybe

02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can compromise on
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
this and what are their plans right well
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
that was one reason why i was sort of
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting if we wanted to meet again
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
this week and invite them here for
 
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting but that if
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's not really uh possible for our
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh the interim study we
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
would certainly invite them to come and
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think we have some representatives
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
here that hopefully will get that
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative daughter a couple of
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
things i'm
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
curious to know if
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
there are other states that are
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
blocking 5g
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if not why does new hampshire have
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be the first one
 
02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:46.550 align:start position:0%
to be the first one
and

02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:49.370 align:start position:0%
also can i make an official motion to
 
02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:50.790 align:start position:0%
also can i make an official motion to
[Music]

02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
recommend interim study
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
let's have an answer the question first
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yes massachusetts has 20 bills
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
to address technology safety
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
um your commission bill
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
is being replicated new york has two
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
bills that does a lot of what you guys
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
already did here so you guys are
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
the leaders in the country but many
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
other states are doing this i was
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
brought in on a panel in michigan
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
and if you go to my personal research
 
02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
repository which is in my signature on
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
the communication i've been sending to
 
02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
the communication i've been sending to
you

02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
go to understanding emfs
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
i have a page in there for bills in
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
other states and you can see what other
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
states are doing and thank you for being
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
the first to take meaningful action
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're leading the way if i may ask
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
could you send
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh you could you send the entire
 
02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh you could you send the entire
committee

02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
all uh
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
either links or documents as to what you
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
just said
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
so we could see what's what's happening
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the rest of the country
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you and the sooner
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'll be asking for motion in a second do
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
we have questions uh represent personal
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
again i don't want a prolonged
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
conversation here but what would happen
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
if we just adjourned for the day we will
 
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
be hearing testimony in another week
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
could we carve out
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
two minutes of time to take an in-person
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
vote on this but in the interim use that
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
time to look at more closely this
 
02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
material and maybe have a
 
02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:39.429 align:start position:0%
material and maybe have a
lively

02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
lively
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
conversation through some other process
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
internet or something would i know if
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's i don't know if that's possible
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
i'm asking actually that that is a very
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
good suggestion it we we could do that i
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
mean it wouldn't take more than
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
45 seconds to for us to go through a
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
motion after we hear the rest of the
 
02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:58.389 align:start position:0%
motion after we hear the rest of the
public

02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
testimony it probably wouldn't be a bad
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
idea to hear
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of the public testimony how
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
does the rest of the subcommittee feel
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
i would approach the chair and say we
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
need to carve out five minutes prior to
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
opening up executive session for the
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
 
02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:14.710 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
to

02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
vote for a recommendation that we could
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
bring forth during the uh executive
 
02:35:18.319 --> 02:35:22.150 align:start position:0%
bring forth during the uh executive
session

02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
i know this can it cuts into everybody's
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
lunch time but why not even a half hour
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
meet at 12 30 we're going to have a
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing at
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
one which i don't know how well attended
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
it would be but maybe some of the people
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
from the industry might show up and say
 
02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:41.110 align:start position:0%
from the industry might show up and say
something

02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
something
meaningful

02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry we're suggesting that we
 
02:35:45.439 --> 02:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry we're suggesting that we
have

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
that we have at least a half an hour
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
before the opening of the public hearing
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
who's we the subcommittee the
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and so is it your intent to
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
take a vote before the public hearing or
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
i would say that we should take a vote
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing but five
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
minutes because then you're going into
 
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
an executive session at two okay so so
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
your recommendation would be for us to
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
come back as a subcommittee uh at 12 30
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
on the 7th to have a little more
 
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
on the 7th to have a little more
discussion

02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing here
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
additional public hearing and then
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
before executive session starts we can
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh have a vote on what we want to
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommend but the public hearing does
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
have to start at two just so that you
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
know i mean the executive session uh
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing has to start at one just
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
just ahead an executive session can
