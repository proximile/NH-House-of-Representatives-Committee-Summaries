you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.840 --> 00:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
for committee members right now we have
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh several uh items we want to discuss
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh one on scheduling i do not have a
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
specific date on the first session yet
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have here in the
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
general court room that was you know we
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
know that we had cross or the date to re
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
get our early bills out that was the
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
17th has been backed over the 10th now
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
when that session day occurs it's still
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
worked out because the governor is going
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
to give his address and all that and try
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
to mesh the two together so that's why
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's you know it has been defined as
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
to exactly which day it's going to be
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be a wednesday or
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
thursday i don't know and as soon as we
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
find that out also um the last week in
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the month of february is usually
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
school holiday week
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to have that as a
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
date in which this committee won't be
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
hearing anything or doing anything but
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
you know i can't say it definitively
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
until we know where we are on executing
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
some of the bills coming up
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that that that those
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
dates agree with what's going on
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
elsewhere outside of our realm here like
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
in the school districts and all that
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
i know up north the school vacation
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
dates always a little contrary to what
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
is south of
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and and of course we should really
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
be gearing all this around what we do in
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
the north country not what we do down
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
here in the southern part of the state
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
and and i would agree with that mr
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
chairman all right thank you you and i
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
are on the same page in that one
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
and you didn't you have to use your
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
principal voice that's thank you
 
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
principal voice that's thank you
um

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh the other point is that we've now
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday we did a great job in getting
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
some uh bills exact and out of the
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee here and we have a lot in
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
consent um the majority of all were went
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
on consent but i'll remind those they're
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
tasked with writing the committee report
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
or what we call used to call the blurb
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
please get that in immediately to me
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
you can send to my email address and
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
then what i'm going to do is put them
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
all in a folder and send them to
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
jennifer jennifer then works with people
 
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
jennifer jennifer then works with people
upstairs

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
upstairs
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
or to lindsay and then she works
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
upstairs and then they get across the
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
paul smith and then on to the speaker
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
for final approval
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we need to get those done because
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to start getting overwhelmed
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
with everything here we don't want to
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
play catch-up ball
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd also like to say on the
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
first bill here after it is introduced
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
here by the prime speaker we're then
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
going to call the department of
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
education up they have asked for a few
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
moments where they can speak on some of
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
the technical side of things in terms of
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
all these bills they're dealing with
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
today and we have the people in charge
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
that program here and so if you're
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
looking through the charter school bills
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
which we have on the docket today
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask the the department any
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
technical questions referencing any of
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
those bills at the very start here we
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
can get them
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
done with their business so they can you
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
know get on other things as well so mr
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
green and company are here so we'll do
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%

all of you at this time

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor and for the record i am in
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
support of
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
does two things
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
first of all it corrects a typo
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
believe it or not that exists in current
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
law in rsa 194 hyphen b
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
where the word charted
 
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.230 align:start position:0%
where the word charted
appears

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
appears
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
char turd
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
second of all it inserts into law a
 
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
second of all it inserts into law a
requirement

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
that chartered public schools be given
 
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
that chartered public schools be given
prior

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.470 align:start position:0%
prior
notice

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
for subsequent meetings
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
of an iep
 
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
of an iep
team

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
as current law reads now
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
when a child enrolls
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
in a chartered public school
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
that child's resident district shall
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
convene a meeting of the iep team
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
and invite
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
a representative of the chartered public
 
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.829 align:start position:0%
a representative of the chartered public
school

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
after this initial meeting
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
the law is silent as to subsequent
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
meetings of the iep
 
00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.150 align:start position:0%
meetings of the iep
team

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
although subsequent invitations
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
may not be necessary going forward
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools do need prior
 
00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools do need prior
notice

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear here we're asking
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
for notice
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily invitation
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
of subsequent meetings for successful
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
student achievement
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
communication and awareness are critical
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
for special education
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the courtesy of prior
 
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.630 align:start position:0%
with the courtesy of prior
notice

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
the chartered public school can better
 
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
the chartered public school can better
track

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
monitor and communicate a child's iep
 
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.389 align:start position:0%
monitor and communicate a child's iep
plan

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
it is not in the best interest of a
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
child if his or her chartered public
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
school is completely
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
unaware of subsequent iep team meetings
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
which could result
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is meant to strengthen the

special education programs for children
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
at chartered public schools with a
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable request
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the child's resident district
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%

team meetings
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
now in concluding my introductory
 
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
now in concluding my introductory
remarks

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
i want to mention a couple of things
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
first of all this bill as well as others
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'll introduce today
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
are a series of bills that have
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
originated from the ground
 
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
originated from the ground
up

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
right from those most familiar with the
 
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
right from those most familiar with the
operation

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
of a charter school
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
to this point here
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
not from top down
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
also i want to mention that throughout
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
the day in this room collectively
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
i believe will be close to about a
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
hundred years worth total if you do all
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
the math
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
of those involved and familiar with
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
charter school adding up their
 
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.710 align:start position:0%
charter school adding up their
experiences

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
with operating charter schools
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
administering them
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
founding them
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
being on boards
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
it goes on and on
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
experts and those most familiar on the
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
ground with the operation of a charter
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
school will be here today
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
and they have requested this bill
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh just to emphasize the importance
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill to special education
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
to also emphasize the origins of this
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill and others i'll introduce today
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
which is very important to hear from
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
those who know charter schools best
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you very
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
much representative are there questions
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative moody for being here um
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the child with disabilities who
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
was attending a charter school
 
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
was attending a charter school
might

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
well have an iep but also being
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
part of the regular education
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
program at the charter school would
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
would that be a correct statement yes
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i have one one question and
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
then perhaps we can get to the
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
department um you're saying prior notice
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
of subsequent meetings
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
is silent
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
in our our statutes
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
that is my reading is it silent in the
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
and in federal law
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for the
 
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:38.949 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for the
department

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
and those speaking
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
after me
 
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
after me
however

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
my interest today my
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
motive to bring this bill forward is to
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
clarify it in the state statutes
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.269 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
nelson

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question you emphasize invite
 
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.189 align:start position:0%
taking my question you emphasize invite
over

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
um a notice why would you do that
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question very good
 
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question very good
question

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
because there's a big distinction
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
an invitation
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
which is in current law for that first
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
meeting means the chartered school team
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
is invited to attend that first meeting
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
but we're looking for
 
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
but we're looking for
notice

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
thereafter not necessarily an invitation
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
and there could be reasons for that
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's possible a parent doesn't choose to
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
have the chartered school at the team
 
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
have the chartered school at the team
meeting

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
so there that thus they wouldn't want an
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
invitation we wouldn't want to force
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
that on the parents
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
so we're looking for the minimum of
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
so we're looking for the minimum of
notice

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
to be given to the chartered school with
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
all due respect to those that are on the
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
iep team including parents resident
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
district teachers etc
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
huge distinction and i'm glad you
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
brought that up so i could re-emphasize
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
that again today
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
that again today
well

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh what i'd like to
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
do now is if there's no more questions
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor of the bill
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
i'd like to invite as i mentioned
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
earlier nate gree and green and company
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
that are with him regarding the
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
as their
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
administered through the department of
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
education if we have questions for them
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill or
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
and perhaps what's coming up they'll be
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
around so we can follow up questions but
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to give a little
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
view of what how the charter schools
 
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
view of what how the charter schools
function

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
function
so

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline for additional schools
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have 10 prospective schools that have
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
filed letters of intent
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%

charter enrollment is currently at
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
5020 for this year which is
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
approximately a 10 increase over charter
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
say i would add
 
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
say i would add
probably

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the charter school grant um
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
we have uh seven schools that
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
were awarded the charter school grant in
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
the first round which occurred in august
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
four of those were startups and then the
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
remaining three were replication and or
 
00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
remaining three were replication and or
expansion

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
i know that several of the bills have
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
been proposed today are bills that make
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
small alterations or provide some
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
additional technical aspects to current
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
law already
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
some of this has helped to fix some of
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
the problems that we've seen within our
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
current charter school system
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%

taking the question
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
you said there's about a 10 increase in
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
the charter school population this year
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
over last year can you give us a
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
ballpark what grade level that you saw
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
most of it in
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have a i don't have a breakdown
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
by grade level but i can certainly pull
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
that information thank you so much
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
further information
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
i had one question for and maybe you all
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't have that or maybe i should go to
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
special ed folks to do that but we on
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
this particular bill we've heard that it
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
is silent on uh how we address or notify
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
on subsequent iep meetings
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
is it is silent just in statute or is
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
there administrative rule which uh
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
explains the process
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that we have to follow in the
 
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
and that we have to follow in the
schools

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh i do know that uh becky is here from
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
the department from the bureau of
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
special education and so she should be
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
able to answer questions that are
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
specific to the federal part of the
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
special education law okay we'll hold
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%

mullen thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
receive complaints from parents in your
 
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
receive complaints from parents in your
role

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
in my role i do not
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay so would either of you have any
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
how many families have raised this as an
 
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
how many families have raised this as an
issue

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can get
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
information on for the committee we do
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a particular individual at the
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
department that handles special
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
education related complaints
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they track whether the
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
student is a charter school or a
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
traditional public school uh in
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
particular but um we could take a look
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
and see if we have breakdowns of those
 
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.710 align:start position:0%
and see if we have breakdowns of those
numbers

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
can i just follow yes thank you mr chair
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
is there anything there's i don't
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything in statute that
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
was would prevent a parent
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
from inviting a member of charter school
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
staff to attend a meeting at the home
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
district is that correct to my
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the parent is one that has
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
the ultimate control over iep meetings
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh who's attending the the makeup of
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
that meeting within what's allowed by
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
current federal regulation i will
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
obviously defer to becky on the exact
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
specifics of that but i do know that the
 
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
specifics of that but i do know that the
parent

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately has the most control when it
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
comes to the makeup of the iep team
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
the lea rep as well as any other
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
individual that has knowledge or
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
expertise of the child
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
and so all of those folks get notice
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
of any iep team meeting
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's initial one or
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh subsequent greetings and our school
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
districts are responsible for notifying
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
those folks which includes the charter
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.430 align:start position:0%
those folks which includes the charter
school

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and um therefore we
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
feel as though this bill is really not
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
necessary it really duplicates something
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's already required in state and
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh so we find it to be unnecessary we're
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
here to oppose the bill and
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh would open it up to any questions the
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
other thing i would add is
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
we're not aware that this is is a
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
challenge and we would ask the question
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
what kind of data exists that would say
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
that there's been a pattern or trend
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
that would warrant some kind of new bill
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and also would note that the department
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
of ed does monitor local school
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
districts on a regular basis when it
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
comes to special education
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
in a variety of ways and that includes
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
those students with ieps
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
enrolled in charter schools
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i would open it up to any questions
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much jane uh questions
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative lakers
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
i noticed that on the thing that you
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
it says additionally any other
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who have special knowledge
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
and expertise
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
can be invited
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
the bill is about making it
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
shall be notified so as opposed to just
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
well that and that's the language from
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
federal and state law um and you know
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
the parent can invite anyone that they
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
want and the general ed teacher
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
typically is the teacher at the charter
 
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.430 align:start position:0%
typically is the teacher at the charter
school

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
so they would naturally get an invite
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
because they are responsible for the
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the instruction for the
 
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.669 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the instruction for the
student

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's in rule
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh in law
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
nazi thank you very much thank you
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
have have next

kim lavalley
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%

my name is kim lavalley and my
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
background that brings me here to
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
testify on this is i've opened two
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
charter schools i'm a co-founder for two
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire charter schools i'm
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
working on several other charter schools
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i also chair the new hampshire
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
charter school foundation which is a
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit with volunteers to support
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
charter schools in the charter
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
application writing or their startup to
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
help them avoid some of the challenges
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
that happen when you're doing a brand
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
new startup
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
i've also had two of my own boys
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
graduate from a charter school and one
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
had an iep
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
i speak in favor of this bill
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
we at charter schools i don't believe
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's intentional from the resident
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
districts but there are notices that do
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
not arrive for these meetings meetings
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
are being held the school is unaware
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it makes it challenging the thing
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do is increase that
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
communication that dialogue that's what
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
will benefit the students if everybody
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
is talking on the same page we're all
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing for the student
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to benefit the child so we're
 
00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.789 align:start position:0%
it's going to benefit the child so we're
requesting

00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
that this please
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions thank you are
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
there any questions yes representative
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
mullen and then
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you so much
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning and taking
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
um in these situations where you've had
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
kids whose resident district has not
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
notified you of an iep team meeting
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
have um you reached out to those school
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
districts and what has the response been
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
to your
 
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
to your
initiating

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
initiating
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes i believe all the charter schools
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
when this happens we reach out and it's
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's not intentional it's not
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
intentional i don't believe there's ill
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
will there um i think sometimes the
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
charter school is kind it's an
 
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.190 align:start position:0%
charter school is kind it's an
afterthought

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
afterthought
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
so while the parents may have that
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to invite us i don't think
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
we should put the burden of that on the
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
parents i think the schools should be
 
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
parents i think the schools should be
communicating

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
communicating
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question further
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
questions coming down represent cordelia
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here um
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
if the child with an iep is taking part
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
in regular education
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
at the charter school
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
federal law requires
 
00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
federal law requires
notice

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
if the child is not in
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
the regular instruction program in the
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
is that when the problem arises or is it
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
um any time there there could be a
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
problem in receiving notice
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
i can speak for the regular ad and again
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's where i see it happen
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
notice is not arriving to the school
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
people find out about the meeting a week
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
later when paperwork arrives with
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
updates or something so
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
and again i don't think it's intentional
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
but i think putting it in writing is a
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
good step in the right direction
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up questions i have one for
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
you you've worked with the charter
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
schools you've had a youngster in a
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
charter school with an iep
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
charter school with an iep
when

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
when this
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
failure to get notice of an iep has
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
occurred has there been an effort on the
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
part of the charter school
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
or yourself to notify the department of
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
education that what is supposed to be
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
happening in accordance with federal law
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe our administrative rules
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
which have gone through our jail car
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
i have had conversations not to file
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
formal complaints again i don't think
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's intentional but just as a reminder
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you know it works better if
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same page and
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
communicating as a mother i did
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
make some phone calls because
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
i had i had actually been left off of a
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
notice so um but it
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know it was an oversight it was
 
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
you know it was an oversight it was
corrected

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
corrected
and

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
we reach out to the school directly
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
typically the resident district as a
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
reminder please don't forget us next
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
time we want to be a part of the team
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me i'd like to
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%

invite uh bob best
merrimack

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have a conscientious group today all
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
wiping it down and
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
on certain days we go through the whole
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
day and i don't ever see it wipe down
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
we'll see what it's like at three
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock yeah
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and thank you uh
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here to talk about
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:40.950 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
as to wiping down the desk now that
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
there's been an example that's been set
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
and followed a few times there's no way
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i could not do this i'll be sort of the
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
bad guy in the group so now we're all
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
committed to it
 
00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:51.430 align:start position:0%
committed to it
um

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
so let me introduce myself my name is
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
bob best i am from uh merrimack and i am
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
an attorney at sullivan hollis orange
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
badge on because i do do lobbying for
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
other entities but i'm not here lobbying
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
for anybody here today i'm speaking on
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and my own experiences
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the board of two charter schools i
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
provide legal counsel to four or five
 
00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:17.269 align:start position:0%
provide legal counsel to four or five
others

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in this issue quite a
 
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in this issue quite a
lot

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of notice and what federal law
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
requires versus what this bill will do
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
is an important question to ask
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
i believe the language in federal law
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
says that these
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
the regular education teacher may be
 
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.509 align:start position:0%
the regular education teacher may be
invited

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
invited
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it requires that that
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
person be invited they should be it
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
certainly is a member of the iep team
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
and it's critical for the person who's
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
spending the most time every day with a
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
student to be a part of that iep meeting
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
but they're frequently not invited
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
i don't i i share
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
miss lavalley's
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
view that it's not intentional that it's
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
an oversight what happens with charter
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
schools is that they're located in one
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
town and have a lot of students from
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that town but then they bring in
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
students from up to 20 other towns
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
around them sometimes
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
and some of those districts around them
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit far and they have
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
one or two students total
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the frequency with which they have a
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
special ed student is less frequent and
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of not an open line of
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
communication that works very well
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
um but it is absolutely critical that
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
the charter school be a part of that for
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
the many reason i mentioned they're the
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
one that spends most time with the kiddo
 
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.389 align:start position:0%
one that spends most time with the kiddo
uh

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
but also
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
as a parent my oldest son had an iep um
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
when you have a failure in an iep team
 
00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.149 align:start position:0%
when you have a failure in an iep team
meeting

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
um you've scheduled it a month out so
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
school starts in september sometime in
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
the middle of october you have your
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
first iep meeting it's a very busy time
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
and if that meeting fails to have the
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
right people at it you say well i'd like
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
to have another meeting with all the
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
right people at it
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
they try to schedule it for mid-november
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
around thanksgiving and it gets
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
disrupted and sometimes it happens in
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
december or january and
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
by the time you get anything going half
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
the school year is gone
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
half the school year is gone
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're thrown off by at least a month
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
probably more like two if you've got to
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
try to reschedule an iep team meeting
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
knowing how busy the school districts
 
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
knowing how busy the school districts
are

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
and it's also important to note that
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
what the bill asks here is such a tiny
 
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.629 align:start position:0%
what the bill asks here is such a tiny
courtesy

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
an email
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's a meeting scheduled on
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
january 6th at 10 am
 
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.349 align:start position:0%
january 6th at 10 am
for

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
bob best
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
son how difficult is that to do and if
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's the viewpoint of school districts
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
that it's already required to be done
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
well then what in the world would be a
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
reason to object to having it here in
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
now what that does do is it does allow
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
our own state department of education to
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
be involved in it
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
finding solutions for ieps that go wrong
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
under federal law is a very complicated
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
thing for parents to navigate and it's
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
always the parent that's in the role to
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
do that they've got to ask for a hearing
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
they've got to make the complaint and
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and even suggesting
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
that it's up to the parent to decide who
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
to invite to their team meeting boy
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's a bit of a stretch um
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
as a parent i wasn't on charter school
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
boards when my son was going through
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's an anxious moment to go to an iep
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
team meeting you don't really know
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
what's going on the federal iep system
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
is byzantine it's complicated
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
you really don't know a lot you kind of
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
expect all the teachers to be there and
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
then when they're not you're confused
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
and somebody says well there was
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
somebody in a substitute we couldn't
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
find somebody so we gave you the science
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
teacher instead of the english teacher
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
but to expect the parent to sort of have
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
know that they're the one that's going
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for letting the
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
charter school know or making sure
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
they're invited well that's a lot to ask
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's just unnecessary why
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
not just have the people who are already
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling a meeting already sending out
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
notices to a whole bunch of people add
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
one email to the list that says
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
january 6 at 10 a.m come on over
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's all the testimony that i have i
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
hope that answers the questions it does
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
happen quite a lot i've been involved on
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of clients
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
that have had this issue with some of
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
the sending school districts
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
i know that i have had some letters on
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of clients that have been sent to
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
the state board about special ed issues
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
i don't recall off the top of my head
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
whether this particular one was among
 
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
whether this particular one was among
them

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
them
um

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that those letters uh for
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
the other whatever subjects they were
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
sent for um caused any particular
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
response or improvement
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%

morning um just um just to clarify
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.270 align:start position:0%
morning um just um just to clarify
um

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
your i mean your testimony i think was
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
the bill before us right now i don't
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
think has anything to do with addressing
 
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.230 align:start position:0%
think has anything to do with addressing
scheduling

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
anomalies or um or notification of
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
parents it's specifically about
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.950 align:start position:0%
parents it's specifically about
notification

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the to the charter uh school when an
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
iep meeting uh has been scheduled and i
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
given you're certainly given your
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
familiarity with um uh with this area
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
of law when you take a look at 194 b
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
colon 11 roman 3 b
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh which is on
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
on our new in our new books is on page
 
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.069 align:start position:0%
on our new in our new books is on page
594.

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
594.
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it it
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically it's exactly what's
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill here when a child is
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
enrolled by a parent in a chartered
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
public school
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
um the local education agency of the
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
child's resident district shall convene
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
a meeting of the
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
individualized educational program team
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
and shall invite a representative of the
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
charter public school
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
to that meeting
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
in your interpretation
 
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.109 align:start position:0%
in your interpretation
does

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
does that only apply to
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
the first meeting
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
of at the beginning when a child is
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
enrolled by a parent in a chartered
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
public school or does that first
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
sentence when a child is enrolled by a
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
parent in a chartered public school
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
the entire period of time the child is
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled by a parent in a chartered
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
public school that's a great question
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for it um
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
your initial comment about the bill not
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
addressing scheduling anomalies though
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
um i want to just comment quickly on
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
that um when the charter school doesn't
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
get an invitation and isn't present the
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
iep team meeting isn't as productive and
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
has to and that's what creates the
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
anomaly that has to get rescheduled so
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
it does sort of create these anomalies
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i would have thought common sense and
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
courtesy would have resolved this kind
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
of a question easily enough or even just
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
a reminder once in a while
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
easily enough why wouldn't you want to
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
know from the teacher that is spending
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
the most time with the student what's
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
going on and what's going to change and
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
now the outcome of an iep team meeting
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
is that the iep may be amended and that
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be immediately known by the
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
people that are going to spend their
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
time with their kids
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's what the importance of it
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
is i would have loved to come here and
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
say that this bill is unnecessary that
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
this language that's in here that talks
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
about an invitation to the initial
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
meeting implies that everybody should be
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
invited to all the meetings
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that's not the case
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the interpretation is
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
by the school districts i don't know
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
whether they've gotten some legal advice
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
that says to do one thing or another or
 
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
that says to do one thing or another or
like

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
i i mentioned earlier and miss lavalley
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
had mentioned whether it's just simply
 
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.589 align:start position:0%
had mentioned whether it's just simply
inadvertent

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
but it's important it's critical to the
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
student that the ipt meeting be there so
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
why don't we just close the loop on some
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
unclear language and reinforce it and
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
then at a minimum the charter school and
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
the parent has rsa 194 b11 3b to show to
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
the school district to say you should
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
have done this and you didn't do it
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up mr chair so um so no and
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
i i understand that and and uh
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i um uh you know i i question
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not putting another thing
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
into law that's already in law
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
somehow makes it stronger or more legal
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
than it or more required than it was
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
before but do you think maybe a
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
something um
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
like a technical advisory coming from
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
the department to um to school districts
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
might enter charter schools might um
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
help to maybe put a little bit more
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
light on um
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
on this than than maybe
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
injecting another sentence into law
 
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.990 align:start position:0%
injecting another sentence into law
that's

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
already there
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
that that's a great comment so as an
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
attorney i am um keenly aware of
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
redundancies and laws and how you wonder
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
why in the world do we need to do this
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
again when it's already somewhere else
 
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.829 align:start position:0%
again when it's already somewhere else
um

00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
wherever it is today it's not effective
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
now would a technical advisory work i
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
think it would for a while i think we
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't immediately arrive to be on
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention span but
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
some technical advisories and technical
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
bulletins that come out of agencies
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
are around for you know years and years
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
and years sometimes decades before
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're updated and they're just not on
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention anymore because
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
they're not searchable there's not a
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
database they're not an rsa it's
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere on a website uh and you know
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes for some state agencies you
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
find things that look like they were
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
photocopied a dozen times over and
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
originally typed on a typewriter as a
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
technical bulletin and nobody even knows
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
what it means anymore that it exists and
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
so when you when you pull it out you
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
show it to somebody they say well you
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
know that's a different time in a
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
different circumstance and i'm not even
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
sure what that means and and that's one
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why for it to be
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear and it's really a
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
simple concept to make clear um in the
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
statute that's published everybody can
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
search it online doesn't get lost it
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get forgotten over time
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you very much
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
attorney best and mr chair i've got to
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
porter

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
porter
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sir for
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question having taught in an
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
elementary school for a long time
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
having many children who had ieps and i
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
was the classroom teacher
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
when the iep meeting is scheduled it
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
always created a
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
conflict in my classroom schedule
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
who's going to cover my class will it be
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
during my planning period will it be
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
during lunchtime is it before school is
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
it after school
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
if the teacher that provides
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
the most service to the kids can't be
 
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
the most service to the kids can't be
present

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the meeting
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
has to be rescheduled
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up on this too sure um i
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
think that the parents role in
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
determining the iep team's construct and
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
whether they were able to meet with the
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
correct number of people or the right
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
number of the right individuals makes
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
all the difference in in the world in
 
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:52.069 align:start position:0%
all the difference in in the world in
that

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it's a hard and fast
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
rule but i do sympathize with what
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying and um i didn't sort of uh
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
offer it as part of my introduction but
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
my wife is the special education
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the merrimack school
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
district for a couple of other
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and she arranges
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
those meetings and sends out all those
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
notices and does exactly what you're
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
talking about to find the substitutes
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
for the teachers to get there so i i
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely understand that circumstance
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
and how challenging it is so i have a
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes okay so if i'm a teacher
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
at a charter school that's um four or
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
five towns away
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
and an iep meeting is called
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i can't have anybody that's covering
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
my group of children for the time it
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
takes to get there attend the meeting
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
and come back could be half a day or
 
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
and come back could be half a day or
more

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
will that if this is in place this this
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
language is in place will that
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
invalidate the meeting will the meeting
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
need to be rescheduled
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
you you understand where i'm getting at
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
this if it's
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
not yet you know she's not right there
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the building she's 30 miles away um
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the mountain
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
how and she can't get there what what
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
happens then sure absolutely um you know
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think today when you have the iep
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
meeting without this change in law if
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
the parent thinks that the right people
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
weren't at the iep meeting the parent
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
can produ pursue that kind of remedy and
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's doesn't change by this bill in
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
any other way
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
but what this notice does in a positive
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
way is uh two things
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
even if the school teacher can't come
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's possible that they can provide
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
information provide an update provide
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
some communication make a phone call
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
send a report do that kind of thing or
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
if that's not possible to do or not
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
wanted by the parent or not necessary
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
for the team at least the school
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
district the charter school knows to be
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
alert to a potential change in an iep
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
even if i couldn't go to the meeting or
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't invited or the parent didn't want
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
me on the team at least i know to be on
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
the lookout that something might have
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
changed in the iep that i need to be
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
aware of as a part of the team so it
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishes a lot even if it doesn't
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
always guarantee every single person you
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
know has their bottom in a seat at the
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
iep meeting
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh you
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned and i just want some uh
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
clarity you mentioned that you had
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
many uh i believe was the word you used
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh had to do many letters
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
complaints on iep meetings and i was
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering out of that many
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
how many are specific were were you
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
talking just specifically charters
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
or were you including the other iep
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh complaints to the regular school
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
district sure absolutely um let me
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that as best i can um i have
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
represented charter schools and had this
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
issue come up many times the actual
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
letters that i've written to charter
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
schools are not it's a handful it's a
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
the letters to the department are a
 
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.829 align:start position:0%
the letters to the department are a
couple

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
couple
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
many times that i've you know complained
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the department but the issue comes up
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh quite a lot um and also i i maybe
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's helpful for um the discussion and a
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
question that came up earlier is sort of
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
what percentage of charter school
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
students are on ieps
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it varies from each charter school
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
to charter school but it usually sits
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that 10 to 20 percent range
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes as high as 25 of the students
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
have ieps
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot it's a
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
follow up on good
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
could you quantify just a little bit
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
more than many or several um
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
like in a given let's say last year
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
how many how many complaints
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
you had yeah sure so in one charter
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
school in particular i can recall um
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
there were at least two or three school
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
districts that each had between one and
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
three students for this charter school
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
where notices weren't provided for you
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
know the whole book if it happens for
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
one it sort of happens kind of across
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
the board because the communication link
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
is somehow broken down
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
so for example if if a charter school
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
has a relationship with town a that has
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
three students in them
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
they'll miss the notice on all three
 
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.710 align:start position:0%
they'll miss the notice on all three
students

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
for that so um
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know could i tell you that overall
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
through the whole state it's 25 or 28 or
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
whatever no i don't really have that
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
kind of data available to me
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
for very for such a simple fix one is
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of too many isn't it
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier that if a
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
parent decides who they want at the
 
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
parent decides who they want at the
meeting

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
say i'm going to give you an example
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's somebody i'm a former special
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
ed teacher and i believe
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
that a student the parent wants an aid
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the student
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
i as a teacher
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher feel that that's
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
not right they don't need the aid you're
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
only enabling them
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
can the parent eliminate me so i can't
 
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
can the parent eliminate me so i can't
give

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
my opinion oh gee i don't know um i
 
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.030 align:start position:0%
my opinion oh gee i don't know um i
don't

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
think they
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.270 align:start position:0%
think they
can

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily stop the opinion coming
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
forward by saying you can't come to the
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
meeting but honestly i've never had to
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
address that question
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
and this was a little bit implied in
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's question as well
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
i don't do general uh special ed
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
representation for school districts in
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
in traditional public schools i don't
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
represent parents and and do that work
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
regularly my work is
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
exclusively on the charter school side
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
and representing the schools so um i've
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
never had to cross that bridge i don't
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
if we have some specific questions that
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
are relative to the department because
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're the next ones up here
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
maybe we can hold those questions
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock can you hold that for
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.829 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock can you hold that for
rebecca

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
rebecca
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen thank you mr
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh attorney bess for
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
so in the uh situations in which you've
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
had the school district that has not
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
been providing notice
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
of the iep meeting and you've gotten
 
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.589 align:start position:0%
of the iep meeting and you've gotten
involved

00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
what has the outcome
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
of those situations been
 
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.069 align:start position:0%
of those situations been
um

00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
usually those situations have had uh
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
other faults as well which were greater
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
than the lack of notice um the school
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
district not um contracting to provide
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
the services that are in the iep with
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
either the charter school or anybody
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
else um and or or um huge gaps in the
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
scheduling sometimes students haven't
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
gotten their their special ed services
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
started until you know october or
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
november at the beginning of a school
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
year um and so although you reach out to
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
the school district and you try to
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
improve things and
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the moment you might get a little
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
bit of a response that one particular
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
issue has never sort of existed on its
 
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
issue has never sort of existed on its
own

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
where it becomes kind of the center of
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
the discussion that one is sort of the
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
small potato and in the big scheme of
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
things so it tends to just get
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
almost it's sort of a
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
by the way don't forget to give me
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
notice and that's kind of as far as you
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
discuss that um
 
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.309 align:start position:0%
discuss that um
so

00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
i can't say that uh
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
i could give you a clean sense on
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
if we ask them for a we get b you know
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
what that's about so thank you very much
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh with that i think we're going to
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving testimony today and
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%

me behind over the couple of minutes
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
that i was actually hoping that that's
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman ladd
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
my name is rebecca ferdet i'm the state
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
director of special education at the
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
department of education um i first want
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
to provide some background information
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
on how special education works in
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
charter schools in new hampshire we have
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
a very unique situation for most
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
for the only state in the union that
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
runs our charter schools the way that we
 
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.230 align:start position:0%
runs our charter schools the way that we
do

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
our charter schools are not in special
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
education are not their own lea
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
the lea responsibility remains with the
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
resident district and that is why we're
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
in this situation of cooperation between
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
the resident district and the charter
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
schools every law that we have and every
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
law that is within idea bases the
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
relationship for this process on the
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
relationship between the lea and the
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
parent and so everything that
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
we discuss relates to how the lea works
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
with the parent to come to these
 
00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:38.549 align:start position:0%
with the parent to come to these
agreements

00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
the relationship is not with the charter
 
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
the relationship is not with the charter
school

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
the way the laws are written um not that
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
they should not be involved they should
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
be involved but if we are just looking
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
at the basis of the law everything is
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
written to go between the lea and the
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
parent so that's where
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
i will speak from because that's it kind
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
of gives you a grounding of where we are
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
for an iep team meeting we follow
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
federal law and it's in our rules under
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
1103 and it gives you who the iep
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
participation members are and any member
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
of that team needs to be a person who is
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable of the student so if
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're inviting people to the meeting
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
you might not necessarily invite
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
the head of the charter school they may
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
not be knowledgeable of that student and
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
that student's needs but you should be
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
inviting the regular education teacher
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
who provides services to that student in
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
the charter school and the regular
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
education teacher is a required member
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
of that team so that that is one of the
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
listed people within the within it
 
00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:41.829 align:start position:0%
listed people within the within it
um

00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at my notes because i
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
took notes as we were going along so i
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
could address this one of the other
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
pieces that may cause confusion with
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is that if we're using the
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
terms prior notice written prior notice
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
is actually a defined term in idea and
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is the notice that the lea gives to
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
the parent to say what action they are
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
proposing or refusing to provide for the
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
student so if we then use that language
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
over here where we are providing prior
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
notice to a charter school i believe
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be confusion as to what
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
a prior notice is if you're we it's
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in in ida it has been an
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
idea for
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
the entire time ida has been alive so
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we provide trainings on what written
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
prior notices this would deviate from
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
what that definition says for written
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
prior notice
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
the act the charter school should be
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
invited the charter school participants
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are listed should be invited to
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
that meeting and they should be
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
receiving notice as the regular
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to the memos and the
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
technical assistance that representative
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
tanner had done we follow one of the
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
office of special education programs
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
practices with the federal government
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
where they put out memos or technical
 
00:53:58.319 --> 00:53:59.589 align:start position:0%
where they put out memos or technical
assistance

00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they provide fact sheets that we are
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
able to look up on their website we
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
follow that same practice so
 
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.069 align:start position:0%
follow that same practice so
um

00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
there are fact sheets that are on our
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
website there are what we call memos
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
that have information that clarify
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
practices we refer to them frequently
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
when working with the fields if there
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
has been something that we've needed to
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
clarify it is something that we refer to
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the website and say you can find it
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
here we will send people the link
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
i know that natasha lupiani who works
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
with many districts and parents will
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
also refer to many of those members to
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
provide that technical assistance that
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
may be needed to clarify some of those
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
rules and that's a practice that we have
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
taken from osep
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to answer any
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
questions that you make so i have one
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
question and then we'll go
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
represent bowman others on the committee
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
so you say the um
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
the lea
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
should be sending notice to these
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's going to be held at
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
the charter school you're going to have
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
to you know a schedule and a space
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
available in a time that's appropriate
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
um has your office or any office over
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
received the concerns that
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
we are not being invited to the iep or
 
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.430 align:start position:0%
we are not being invited to the iep or
the

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent i i i'm looking at subsequent
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
ieps i see all ieps as an iep
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so it shouldn't be a subsequent ip
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's an iep meeting whether it's the
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
first year annual or every three years
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
you're in in the neighborhood of doing
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
that but i i'm really concerned that
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
if um
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's my guess but i know of several
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
districts where i live they are doing
 
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.789 align:start position:0%
districts where i live they are doing
this

00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
um so then um
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a best practice i don't know
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
but i thought it was law and rule
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
what action has the department taken if
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
you hear is there uh communication
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify the law with the
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
directors of these lease a special edge
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
is there a corrective or improvement a
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
letter sent out saying you need to get
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
on and do this thing correctly
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
what's a doe doing sure so um we have
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
gotten probably in the two years that
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
i've been in my position maybe three or
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
four phone calls regarding um not
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
receiving notification on the part of
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
the charter school what we would do
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
because i will go back to again the
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
relationship is between the lea and the
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
parent so a charter school cannot file a
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
complaint with us regarding something
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
that the lea has not done the parent can
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
file a plan but the charter school
 
00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:26.870 align:start position:0%
file a plan but the charter school
cannot

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
so but we would
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to the district and remind
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
them of their responsibility to invite
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
the members of the team that are
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate which would be the regular
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
education teacher at the charter school
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
and would clarify that role for them
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
they have no obligation to invite other
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
members of the charter school because as
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
i stated it's only members who have a
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the student at unique to
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
the student and would be able to
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
contribute to the meeting so while the
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
regular education teacher would be
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
somebody that they're required to invite
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
the principal or head of the charter
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
school would not be somebody that
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're required to invite
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i've just one follow-up question
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh when i was a school principal for all
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
those years and we had these iep
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
meetings we would get substitutes for
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the teacher that had come into the
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
meeting or teachers plural
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
being is the lea responsible for
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
providing the
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
funds for a substitute at the charter
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
quick okay it's going around represent
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
boom then rep santana and then what
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and i've been
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
holding this question
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of a charter high school
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
which we have a few
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
who is the general education teacher
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be invited or all of
 
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
that's going to be invited or all of
them

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
so typically what would be done in a
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
public school is that you would invite
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
all of them but typically you would get
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
one of them so that would be the same
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
case of all the teachers that they have
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
at the charter public school you may
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
invite all of them but one usually it's
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to can you and then they
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
figure out of those or
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
where does their disability impact the
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
most within the classes that they are
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
taking if they have a
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability in reading
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
you might want to make ensure that the
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
english teachers is the one that's
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
invited rather than the science teacher
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
but there's no requirement to say that
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
all of those teachers would need to be
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
at the meeting
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
that same issue occurs at the elementary
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
schools as well middle school represent
 
00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:25.589 align:start position:0%
schools as well middle school represent
tanner

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh the previous speaker mentioned that
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
this bill allows our own
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of education to
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
get involved and i was just wondering if
 
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.309 align:start position:0%
get involved and i was just wondering if
that

00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
if that is
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
how you see this bill that this bill
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
allows the new hampshire department of
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
education to become more involved
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
in these notifications of iap um
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
then currently exists under
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
our own statutes and federal ida laws
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
our involvement may change slightly from
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
what it is because we would be reaching
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
out and saying you are required to
 
00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:05.190 align:start position:0%
out and saying you are required to
provide

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
notice to someone at the charter school
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
but again we go back to the relationship
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
is between the lea and the parents so
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
there would be no
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
there would be no way for a charter
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
school to file a complaint if they did
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
not receive notice it would have to fall
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
upon the parent to again file that
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
complaint to say the charter school was
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
not invited to my meeting
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
so we may provide technical assistance
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
like we do now and change the way we
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
word what we're saying but it really
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
our ability to do anything different if
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
and just to make clear in my own mind so
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't
 
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.710 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't
uh

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
any different with the charter school
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
either does it as far as whether they
 
00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.510 align:start position:0%
either does it as far as whether they
can

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
they can they're involved or not it's
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
still the lea yeah okay thank you
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i appreciate
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
your consideration i have a couple as
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting um just off the top
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
and you may assume you have the answer
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
do you know how many uh
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
charter schools uh are high school
 
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.589 align:start position:0%
charter schools uh are high school
focused

01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
focused
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
i i do not i could give you special ed
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
do we know that representative how many
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
actual child schools have high school
 
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
actual child schools have high school
components

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't know but you know i would
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
imagine that there's a number of kids
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
there that go from middle school into
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
that level so i that we can get that
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
information i'm sure that we can get it
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
from d.o.e so but back to my original
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the la or as we read it and
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure my assumptions
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
are correct
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh on line five which it doesn't matter
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't have that it just says they
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
shall invite and the initial didn't say
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
initial meaning it says shall invite the
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative um so my assumption is
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
that if i get an invitation it's an
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
invitation to participate
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh but the law and the second one it
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
says all subsequent meetings the as you
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
said there's no relationship with the
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
active violation actually got a
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with each other but it says
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
that they'll just provide a notice
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming that a notice
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
is different from
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
a invite to participate if i were to
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
look at the wording because of the
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
definition of written prior notice i
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
would say that it is something different
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
um however if if
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have them noticed of the
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
meeting they could the charter school
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
representatives beyond the regular
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
education teacher
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
could be listed as an other participant
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
as appropriate so you you have these
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
required members that are typically
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
listed on your
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
meeting notice your regular education
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
teacher your special education and then
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
you also can say um we're also going to
 
01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:53.349 align:start position:0%
you also can say um we're also going to
notify

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
notify
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
sally who has been providing some speech
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
path speech services but she may not be
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
able to make it but the speech
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
pathologist is here so they could be
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
listed as somebody else who is an other
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
participant but may not necessarily be
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
at the meeting but any participant has
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
to have knowledge of the child to be
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
participating in the meeting
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just so clarity then so
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying then that if i receive
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
this if the charter school receives the
 
01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:18.630 align:start position:0%
this if the charter school receives the
notice

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
either in this case maybe visa to be the
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
parent but to receive the notice
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
that means in your mind that's the same
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
as an invitation to participate
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just that after the fact we're
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
having a meeting in two weeks on on
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
student x we're saying we're saying
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's the notice so what we're saying
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
now is you're you're welcome to send a
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative and participate right if
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
they were yes if they it would be an
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
option to participate it wouldn't be a
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to participate but if you
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
added them to the meeting notice it
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
would give them that notice of we're
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
having this meeting but it wouldn't
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
require them if you listed them as as a
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
separate member
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you appreciate it thank
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
you very much representative porter
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
my question i'm not sure you can answer
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned at the very beginning
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
of your testimony that new hampshire is
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
unique in how we handle special
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
education and charter schools um
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
can you give me an example of how other
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
states what they do with this sure so
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
most other states will um make
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
their charter schools their own lea and
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
then the then that charter school is
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for the special the
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
provision of special education services
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
so the charter school would be
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for funding that as well yes
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
and do they get funding from the state
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
to help them out yes or is it a tuition
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
that they check
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
they get they get it from the state to
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
help them out but many of those states
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
have income tax or have other means to
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um be able to provide for those for
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
those pieces thank you
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
i wonder if one of
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects of this problem might
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
be addressed if we inserted the word
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
timely in front of notification industry
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and when we're all talking about to give
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
the sense that time is of the essence
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
yep so for a notification for a meeting
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
we must provide 10 days notice so that
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
is already within the language um if you
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
if if a if a charter school needed more
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
than 10 days notice it would be
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
something else we would have to add in
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
but currently any of those
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
those notices for meetings is a 10-day
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
requirement from the date of the meeting
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
and typically a district provides more
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
than 10 days they may provide 30 days or
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
and some of them are reaching out to
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
parents and trying to find that day that
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
works and it might be three weeks from
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
now rather than 10 days from now so
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
questions that's yes representative
 
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.190 align:start position:0%
questions that's yes representative
nelson

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you i'm a
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
little bit off but does the
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
parent have a right not to have somebody
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
come the school district wants somebody
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
to come to the meeting
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
and the parent says i do not want them
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
who's right
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
so if it's one of the required members
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to say like if it
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
were the classroom teacher or the
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
special education teacher we have to
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
have that at the meeting um if it were
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else um that does not have
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the child and has no is not
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
going to provide any information to the
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
meeting that's um supportive then yes
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
they could say they don't want the
 
01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:12.549 align:start position:0%
they could say they don't want the
person

01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
person
yes

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
if it was another teacher in the school
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
not the classroom teacher would there
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
would they be counted as somebody that
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
could come or would the parents have
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
veto power if the if the teacher
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
works with the student and has knowledge
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the child they could participate in
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh there is no
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is one quick one thank you thank
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you please thank you based on your
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
information and this information you
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
just gave us about notice and the ide
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
definitions right and the pro the tech
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
the process you currently use
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is awarded do you see
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
it as redundant and necessary
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or do you see it as
 
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or do you see it as
necessary

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think that there's obviously a concern
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
if this has been brought to this level
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
where we need to discuss this um but i'm
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
not i
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
i had expressed my concern about using
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
the language of prior notice um i think
 
01:06:07.599 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
the language of prior notice um i think
that

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.309 align:start position:0%
that
if

01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think that there is the requirement
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
for a regular education student who is a
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
member of the charter not student excuse
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
me regular the regular education teacher
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
who is a member of the charter school to
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
be invited to that meeting i think that
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that and maybe some
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
technical assistance might be needed but
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that changing the language
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
would necessarily change the outcome
 
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.190 align:start position:0%
would necessarily change the outcome
okay

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
this happen
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%

i have an amendment
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
which replaces the entire bill
 
01:08:42.799 --> 01:08:46.309 align:start position:0%
which replaces the entire bill
um

01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
it also modifies some sections of the
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
2020 bill but
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment um addresses uh many of
 
01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.990 align:start position:0%
the amendment um addresses uh many of
well

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
several of the concerns that we heard
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
and uh would be uh
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for your test my
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
other questions representative porter
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want a clarification mr
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
if the amendment is introduced
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
and it's changing the entire bill
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
is there an opportunity for the public
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
to comment and justify or
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
is this the only opportunity that the
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
public would have to discuss this bill
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
well if the amendment changes the whole
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill um
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
and the title and germaness yes we would
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
have another hearing
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
i have not seen that amendment so i
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
can't tell you uh
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
what's what's in it and so i can't make
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
that decision but a bill that totally
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
changes and goes to a you know a
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
different statutory reference uh
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
his title
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it's going from nuts to bolts
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
then we would have a hearing
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
if if i might mr chairman
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
it does change the title
 
01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
it does change the title
and

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
replaces everything after the enacting
 
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.390 align:start position:0%
replaces everything after the enacting
clause

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the chances are we may we may we
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
could uh we i'd have to read it i can't
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know but that it's not an early bill
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
so there's lots of time to
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner um is there any
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
reason we're not seeing that right now
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they're if it's available i think he
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
was just saying there is and then he's
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
giving us information he did not go into
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
any specifics about that amendment
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
knowing that he's been advised we've all
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
been advised not to do that
 
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
been advised not to do that
um

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so it will be made available
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
to us and we'll we'll
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
like like i just said represent porter
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it and see where we go
 
01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it and see where we go
next

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman um
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
when we finish uh should i hand out
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
copies of that amendment to the
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee yeah the amendment of course
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
will be introduced by this committee at
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
another time it's just information being
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
provided to us so yes uh there's no harm
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
and information coming to us
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for an executive
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
session oh by the way i've got this
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it's wise to do it now
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock so for clarity uh
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative codelli
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment we may see in a few
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
minutes we can't talk about today but
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about the future
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh is going to totally uh change this
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
correct so we're probably not valuable
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
to waste our time discussing this would
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
you say that correct
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you do you agree with that
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative well i i i believe we
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
have a bill in front of us right now and
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
there may be those i haven't looked to
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
see what we got for pink cards it looks
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
like there's some there
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
um so we have in front of us not that
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
amendment we have this bill so we'll
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
continue having the hearing on this bill
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
but we won't be discussing that
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment at all thank you
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this does i think
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
fall under the purview of the bill we're
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
looking at and it's something that i've
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
wondered about um and perhaps uh
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli can answer my
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
question on if at an iep meeting it is
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
determined that a
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
youngster who's going to a charter
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
school needs a one-on-one assistance
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
who under under the current law or under
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for hiring that
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
assistant who is responsible for paying
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
that assistant who is responsible for
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
this for the uh
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
benefits allotted to that assistant and
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible for firing that
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
assistant if there was
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.390 align:start position:0%
i um
my

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the resident
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
school district is responsible for
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
services for that child in the charter
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
school and therefore would be
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
for the aid
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in a public school the
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
one-on-one assistants
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
will take other responsibilities on when
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
she's not or he's not with the child
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
that needs her assistance right away so
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
in other words a lot of
 
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.709 align:start position:0%
in other words a lot of
the

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals that were in my school
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
would be with their child when they
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be with them in the classroom
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
but when that child did not need them
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
that para would go and do a lunch duty
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
or a recess duty or go to the library
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and watch the kids while the teacher had
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
a break
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
would the paraprofessional that this
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
sending district is paying for
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
um be doing those kinds of roles at the
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
charter school do you
 
01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
charter school do you
suppose

01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
suppose
um

01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
can i say
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
please i don't want to suppose a little
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
bit here but the lea is totally
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
that which is the sending the district
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
where the special ed person you know is
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
paris coming from
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
i i do think i'm sorry i i do think it
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
speaks to the relationship between the
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
resident district and the charter school
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the communication that is required
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
management of personnel supervision
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
first all that comes into play
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh further uh a discussion from yes
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome back
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
so as i read through this bill
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
i kept writing
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
isn't this already law
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i wrote that with regards to the lea
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
being responsible for services the
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
written consent
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment and the
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
involvement of parents as full team
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
members i wrote isn't this already law
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
next to each one of those things so
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is isn't this
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
already law
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
um

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in 2020 was
 
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
the bill in 2020 was
introduced

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
discussions i had with
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
parents or maybe they had with me
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
in relation to problems they encountered
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
with having their special needs child at
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
a charter school
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
and break down
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
in various
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
areas of that
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
provision of services
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
so that's why i introduced the bill and
 
01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
so that's why i introduced the bill and
tried

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
tried
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
not to dictate any one thing in terms of
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
where the services were to be provided
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but keep it
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
general um just to provide some
 
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
general um just to provide some
direction

01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.110 align:start position:0%
direction
for

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
in particular the parents so they knew
 
01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.590 align:start position:0%
in particular the parents so they knew
also

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
law is quite complicated as we have
 
01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
law is quite complicated as we have
heard

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
and based on the questioning
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
by this committee whenever there is
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
something of a
 
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.270 align:start position:0%
something of a
bill

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
with relation to special education so i
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
was trying to keep it generic but
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
provide some direction especially for
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
the parents as to
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
how that relationship should work
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
within the charter school resident
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
so for my own clarity representative
 
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
so for my own clarity representative
i

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
i hear you and i think we've heard that
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
there are problems and people are trying
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
to solve them in a variety of different
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
ways but my question is the points that
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
are raised in the bill are they not
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
already part of fate of federal and
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
state special education law
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes one of the emails we got on this
 
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.950 align:start position:0%
yes one of the emails we got on this
bill

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
from a charter school
 
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.550 align:start position:0%
from a charter school
person

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
was wondering about the shall be full
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
participants on you know that the
 
01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.430 align:start position:0%
participants on you know that the
parents

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
shall be full participants on the iep
 
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
shall be full participants on the iep
team

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
and their question was
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
what if
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
the parents don't want to participate
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
in this currently they can still go
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
ahead and have currently they do
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the lea go ahead and and have a
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
meeting just without the parents so that
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
the kid can get
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
whatever help they need
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
and with this by saying full
 
01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
and with this by saying full
participants

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
participants
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to imply that the parents would
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
have to be there and what if the parents
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
aren't willing
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
um i i think that that is uh
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
addressed in in federal law
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are provisions in law for a parent
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
not being at a meeting and there are
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
requirements as to what happens
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
when that situation
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
if the parent doesn't show up there has
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
to be documented all the attempts
 
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.189 align:start position:0%
to be documented all the attempts
to

01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
contact that parent for instance so i
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
think that there are provisions to
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
address that in law that i didn't
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
feel necessary to go into in this
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh not seeing any
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
we've already heard from the
 
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
we've already heard from the
department

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then we also have jane bergeron from
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association school of
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrators welcome jane

administrators welcome jane
again

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
represent cornell
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't even the bill we're going to
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
be discussing though when it comes time
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
to it's
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's debatable that the
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment's not even on the table we'd
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
have probably a different hearing if
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's totally changed
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a bill in front of us okay
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we own that bill now okay and so we
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
have the courtesy of providing all that
 
01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:43.669 align:start position:0%
have the courtesy of providing all that
input

01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%

01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire association of
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
special education administrators i won't
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
take a lot of your time i'm here to
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent over 270 members within our
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
association when we are in
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill um and i'm
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
providing you with my testimony but much
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
of it you've already heard this morning
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
as you know the resident school district
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the provision of a
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
fape for all students with
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities that includes those who are
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
enrolled in new hampshire's public
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools we feel as though this
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill as written is
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
duplicative of what is already required
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
of school districts in regards to
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
providing a fape um as well as
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned the issue of parental
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
consent um which is required and
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessary that the parent be a part of
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
all aspects of the child's iep
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
development and the process and what
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
again raised the question
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
has there been
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
any kinds of identification of
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
non-compliance around the lack of
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
provision of faith for children students
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public charter schools and
 
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.350 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public charter schools and
that

01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
ieps are being amended without the
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
consent of
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
parents it's not something that um
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're aware of it's not something that
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
the department of ed has made us aware
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
of and we check with them regularly in
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
terms of things that we should be aware
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
of and uh working with our charter
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
schools to change

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
the question of parental consent and
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
parental participation
 
01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
parental participation
so

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if those two attributes
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
of this law are currently in effect in
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
yes they are they are okay okay follow
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
up yes so based on the information
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
probably presided and the attempt to
 
01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
probably presided and the attempt to
change

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
is it your position or what is your
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
position is if is this bill necessary or
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
is it redundant
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
um anything that is within the bill
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
currently is something that is already
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
currently within law um
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
it may need clarification obviously
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns but it is already
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
currently in law
 
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.189 align:start position:0%
currently in law
so

01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
your position is it's necessary it's
 
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
your position is it's necessary it's
redundant

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
i don't take it i i'm neutral she she
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
does not take a position on her pink
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
does not take a position on her pink
card

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
the department's here for neutral
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
oh i get the information thank you
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome you read between the
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
lines and uh figure that one out i have
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
one question for the department and it'd
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
be a quick one
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
a number number of years ago the
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative sitting right directly
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
behind you to your left and i sat on a
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee over at the school boards
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
association in that building dealing
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
with special ed services to charter
 
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.550 align:start position:0%
with special ed services to charter
schools

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
and that went on for numerous meetings
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment was always
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
a hot topic
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
especially with charter schools
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment can be
 
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.550 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment can be
interpreted

01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to serve me in my school
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
at which would be the charter school and
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
of course statutory losses no we don't
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
have to do that we can have that service
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
delivered back in the sending or in the
 
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
delivered back in the sending or in the
lea

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
lea
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
have you had any issues with least
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
restrictive environments
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
language being used with charter schools
 
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.350 align:start position:0%
language being used with charter schools
or

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
everything seem copacetic so for charter
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
schools because they are not an lea we
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
do not currently approve special
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
education programs within
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
so anything that is provided within a
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
charter school is considered regular
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
education if you needed a special
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
education environment you would need to
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
go back to the public school to obtain
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
services within a special education
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
environment unless
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
somebody is sent to the charter school
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
to provide those services but a charter
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
school does not have any special
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
education programs per se so they would
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
not have any i understand so i don't
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
think you're really hitting on what i'm
 
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
think you're really hitting on what i'm
asking

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
a child needs speech pathology
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
and there's a similar class back in
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
where that individual comes from whether
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe four or five kids can get together
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
and this youngster over there would
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from that group however there's
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
also the opportunity to send a speech
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
pathologist to the charter school which
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
does happen
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
encountering any issues with how we're
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
interpreting least restrictive
 
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.149 align:start position:0%
interpreting least restrictive
environment

01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
so least restrictive environment only
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
applies to those programs that i had
 
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.550 align:start position:0%
applies to those programs that i had
discussed

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
as to the issue that you're addressing
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
um we are i know that there are issues
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
with staffing and so there are many
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
times currently that they cannot get
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
somebody out to the charter to school to
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
provide a service and then they would
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
need to have the child come to the
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
public school the regular public school
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
to get those services
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
but that wouldn't relate as we calculate
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
lre that wouldn't be within our
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
calculation of lre
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
am i making sense that is that clear or
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
l our least restrictive environment i'm
 
01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
l our least restrictive environment i'm
sorry

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
i understand least restrictive
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
environment and you know i dealt with
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your information that it's
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
a hot topic i don't think we're gonna
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
resolution here today on that
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion from the committee
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent lakas
 
01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.229 align:start position:0%
yes represent lakas
um

01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
following on a previous question
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
when you say that it's in law is it in
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
state law or federal law or
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
where both its different parts are in
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
different i mean i could
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
kind of quote all of them for you if you
 
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to but it's they're all in
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh i don't yes
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
let's have a question are there rulings
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
by um federal government like ocr
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
or by the courts defining
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue about least
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment in charter
 
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.910 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment in charter
schools

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
so we go back to the
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is what osep referred to
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
as a unicorn in how we
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
address charter schools so we
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
do not address charter schools the same
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
way lre is calculated the same way in
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
other states for charter schools because
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
they are the lea responsible for special
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
education because we do not have the
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
charter school as an lea for special
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
education we can't calculate lre in the
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's based off of approved programs
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
and are we the only state that does not
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
recognize the charter school as an lea
 
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
recognize the charter school as an lea
yes

01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand it yes
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i don't see any
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
further hands
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any other pink cards for
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
this particular bill so we're going to
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes at this time eight in
 
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.390 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes at this time eight in
support

01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to enter into
 
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to enter into
1193

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
1193

i have worked with the department and uh
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
actually the two gentlemen from the

department behind me
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
um on this legislation
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is based on uh
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
some complaints the department had
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
received um in relation to um
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
what was going on in a few charter
 
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
what was going on in a few charter
schools

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and i want to emphasize that these
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
broad complaints
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
um but targeted complaints about a few
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
things a few issues that are going on
 
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
things a few issues that are going on
first

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
beginning online
 
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.990 align:start position:0%
beginning online
two

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
there was an issue with fees being
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
charged by charter schools over and
 
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:13.910 align:start position:0%
charged by charter schools over and
above

01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
the tuition provided to the charter
 
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
the tuition provided to the charter
school

01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.189 align:start position:0%
by the state
so

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
we've added the language that
 
01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.629 align:start position:0%
we've added the language that
any

01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
fee charge this student shall not be a
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
condition for enrollment
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the fees were making it
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for the parent
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
to afford to go to the charter school
 
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
to afford to go to the charter school
even

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why we
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
thought it necessary to put this in
 
01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.030 align:start position:0%
thought it necessary to put this in
statute

01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the second it's a new subparagraph of
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
getting on line 5
 
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.070 align:start position:0%
getting on line 5
addresses

01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
really border
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
where they
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
can and do enroll
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
out of state
students

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
into the charter school
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
and actually can charge tuition
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
to those out of state
 
01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.189 align:start position:0%
to those out of state
students

01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.870 align:start position:0%
students
and

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
there was an issue about whether
 
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.229 align:start position:0%
there was an issue about whether
the

01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:24.239 --> 01:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
the
state

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment for a charter school
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
what happens if they're accepting
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
out of state charter schools students
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
who are paying tuition
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's crowding out basically
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
resident new hampshire students from
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
enrolling in that charter school
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that was the
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
reason for this new sub-paragraph
 
01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
reason for this new sub-paragraph
and

01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me specifying that preference in
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment should be given to in-state
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
students to try and address
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
and again these are
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh not broad-based issues that are
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
happening within our charter school
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
community but more isolated
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
incidents but we felt uh that they
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed for the benefit
 
01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed for the benefit
of

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire parents
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
and students are there any questions of
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative ellison
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
question

01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
can you give us some examples of
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
those non-application fees that were
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
being charged that people
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
contacted you about
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
um they contacted the department um and
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
um i do not recall in my conversations
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the department whether any specific
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
were discussed but just that
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
some felt it was
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
a barrier in terms of attending that
 
01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:55.669 align:start position:0%
a barrier in terms of attending that
school

01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative porter
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative um for taking this
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
question when my husband and i ran our
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
little school
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
extras that we offered to the kids was
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
piano lessons we had a woman who came in
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
and taught kinder keys and it was a
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful program and they enjoyed it
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
very much but it was also a little bit
 
01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.229 align:start position:0%
very much but it was also a little bit
pricey

01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
pricey
 
01:32:22.239 --> 01:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
pricey
so

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
in order to keep our rates down we
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
charged the parents
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
a fee for
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
having their kids take the piano lessons
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that the kind of
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
fee that you're talking about here or is
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
it some other kind of fee i mean are the
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
fees that are being charged are they for
 
01:32:41.199 --> 01:32:42.310 align:start position:0%
fees that are being charged are they for
extras

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
extras
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
or add-ons or are they part of the
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
regular uh curriculum i i think that
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
that might be better addressed to the
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
department um as they had
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with the uh the parents
 
01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.270 align:start position:0%
discussions with the uh the parents
involved

01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
further questions
not

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
represent whitaker thank you just thank
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%

fees

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the term
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment it's not as a condition of
 
01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.550 align:start position:0%
enrollment it's not as a condition of
enrollment

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
enrollment
is

01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:16.709 align:start position:0%
is
that

01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
is that enrollment are you talking about
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
not as a condition of acceptance
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
or as a condition of maintaining
 
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
or as a condition of maintaining
enrollment

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
i i believe that um the issue was fees
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
that were expected when the child um was
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
applying to enroll in that charter
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
school okay so that the application
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
wrong right okay application fees
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions of
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
do we have any other bills on
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to draw this out but could
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
we get some clarification from the
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
department about what kind of fees we're
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking about here because there seems
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
to be some confusion about what
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
what fees were sure dealing with is
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
there anybody in the department that
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
could you you must have heard what
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative ellison was addressing
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
that might have some pearls of wisdom
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
hey green new hampshire department of
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
education i'll try to provide some
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
pearls of wisdom for you
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
we do have a number of parent complaints
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
we've received over the past couple of
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
years in regards to this issue
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.910 align:start position:0%
it is
both

01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
fees that are charged as a condition of
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
enrolling in this school
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
not you know titled an application fee
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
but are as such and then there are fees
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
that are ongoing that as the student
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
comes back each year there are fees that
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
are expected as part of returning to the
 
01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
are expected as part of returning to the
school

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
which we would look at is going beyond
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
an application fee for the most part
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
these fees tend to be listed under the
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
category of things like supplies and
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
so it's money that's being provided to
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
the school so that they can then provide
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
art classes textbooks and supplies for
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
carrying out the educational curriculum
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
at the school
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
we've seen some of these highs
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
some of these fees be as high as a
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.310 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
okay

01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you represent tanner
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
question i just again would like
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail quantifying a
 
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail quantifying a
number

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
you said a number of uh you've had a
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
number over the past couple years i just
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
is it like tens hundreds uh
 
01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:41.270 align:start position:0%
is it like tens hundreds uh
five

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh i would say somewhere between a dozen
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh representing woodcock
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representing the chat but
 
01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representing the chat but
uh

01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on the
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
screen uh two
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
question from before uh can you tell me
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
approximately or how many uh charter
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
schools have high school divisions
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
sure so of the approximately 30 uh
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools we have in the state
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
about 15 of them have high school
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
programs so it's roughly half okay great
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
that i didn't have a clue on that one
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you the second one if i may as we
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
got this particular bill
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh on the i asked representative uh
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
codell the same question i want to make
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
sure we get the same answer not that it
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the same answer uh on line
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
four we talk about enrollment is that
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment do you have the other nature
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
of it in front of you
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes does that enrollment mean
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment for admission or continuing
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh for both okay all right
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
and one final one so these fees that
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're not application fees
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's pretty clear i can't have an
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
additional fee to apply for the school i
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand that but the fees that uh
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh ellison was talking
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
about these non-fees that you mentioned
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the supplies the curriculum the odd
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
fees those pieces so under this bill
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
none of those will be applicable
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't be applicable in terms
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
of being a condition for enrollment so
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
we have some situations right now where
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
we have charter schools that charge a
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
fee for supplies and materials
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned sometimes it runs as high
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
as 800 or a thousand dollars
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
in cases where students and families
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to pay the fee the
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools have provided
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents to do
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
community service to the school
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
but in particular some of the complaints
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we have received involve
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
students maybe come from single-parent
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
homes where the parent isn't able to
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
come to the school and and donate that
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
level of time in order to make up for
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
the fee and the way it's presented to
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
the students and families is that they
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
either have to provide the community
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
service or they have to pay the fee in
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
order to stay enrolled within the school
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what would be prevented by
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
represent cornell
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you just one question do you know
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
how many students come from out of state
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
and attend our charter schools
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
i i don't off top my head but that's
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
something that we could take a look at
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and provide to the committee
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
charter schools are able to do when they
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
accept students from out of state is
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're able to develop their own
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
contractual relationships with the
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
sending districts where the students are
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
coming from from out of state
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
and those districts or those families
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
pay a tuition to the charter schools
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's a much larger amount of
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
money than the state of new hampshire is
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
providing to the charter school for
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
students so it's an opportunity for
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
charter schools to make money off of the
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
students that they're enrolling in other
 
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
students that they're enrolling in other
states

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
and if that student needs special
 
01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:41.109 align:start position:0%
and if that student needs special
education

01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
who's the lea
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
the services would have to come from the
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
sending district which would be out of
 
01:38:45.679 --> 01:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
sending district which would be out of
state

01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so i have a follow-up to
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion on charter
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
schools and where there's a number of
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
applicants and the charter school can't
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
house them all there's a lottery
 
01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
house them all there's a lottery
so

01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
if we have a student coming in from
 
01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
if we have a student coming in from
maine

01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
that wants to go to a charter school or
 
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.750 align:start position:0%
that wants to go to a charter school or
massachusetts

01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to pay this fee are
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
they displacing
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
kids that are coming from a residence in
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
in this lottery it's possible so the way
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
the lottery is set up right now there
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
isn't a preference for in-state versus
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students so if during the
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
course of that lottery an out-of-state
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
student was selected and an in-state
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
student was not selected that would be a
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
case where the out-of-state student is
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
displacing an in-state student this
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
particular language would provide
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
preference within the lottery system
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
itself so that out-of-state students
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
would then fill slots that have not been
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
wow okay uh represent woodcock had his
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
hand up first thank you and i appreciate
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
the larry
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
lottery clarification and representative
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli's bills that the new hampshire
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
students should have first priority
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
they if if
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
a china school
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
provide requires
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
funding for supplies and curriculum
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
i'm confused because in a public school
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
we can't charge for curriculum supplies
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
i understand field trips and the add-on
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
stuff but the fundamental piece how is
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
it that a child school
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
can charge a family for fundamental
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
supplies when they're a public school
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is something that we're
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
trying to correct with this particular
 
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.590 align:start position:0%
trying to correct with this particular
language

01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
language
um

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are some instances where that may
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for example in our
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
traditional high schools there are
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when a student wants to take
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
an ap course where the cost of taking
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
the ap exam that comes with the course
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
is covered by the student and the family
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
but paying for the exam is not
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily condition of enrolling in
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the ap course you can take the class for
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
free without having to take the exam at
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
the end so there are things like that
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
where we don't want to eliminate that
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this particular language we're just
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
trying to eliminate instances where fees
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
charged to students are directly related
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
to a condition of enrollment in the
 
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
to a condition of enrollment in the
school

01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
which as you said these are public
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
chartered schools they should be free
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
open and public to all students who want
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
to enroll
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you everyone you're
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
welcome represent tanner
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so is
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
does this apply to continued uh
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment so let's say an out-of-state
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
student applies
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh year one
 
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.669 align:start position:0%
uh year one
and

01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
is able to get in because there's
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's room but then by maybe year two
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
or three
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
now the charter school has a lot more
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
applicants from in-state does that that
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
bump out that person that student that's
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
been in that charter school
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
paying in
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
a fee a yearly fee
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
for those three years
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
because they're now getting bumped out
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
by in-state students
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
at that point they would not be bumped
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
out they would continue their enrollment
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the school because they would not be
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
part of the lottery they're already a
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
maxine thank you very much thank you
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
interesting topic
 
01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
interesting topic
yeah

01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay we don't have anything else on that
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
so we're going to take a break and
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
stretch because we have one more bill i
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
believe before lunch and that's the
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
charter conversion school
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we can take a break here and start
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
thing that back up around 11 o'clock
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
not many signed in any way in this bill
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
it is interesting yeah you know i
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
i just questioned the wisdom of getting
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
involved with kids out of state when all
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
of a sudden
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
you have a pandemic come up and all
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's shouting to get in the
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
charter school but they can't because we
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
no i haven't done that
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
we couldn't get reptile labor had it
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
oh we've been told we've been told a
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
huge huge group
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know i i had one of the reps right
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
here say that my whole
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
school district wants to come and talk
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
on that thing
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that was uh hobbs
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so uh with that um
 
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
and so uh with that um
we

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
we have to go we couldn't go to finance
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's being used that room so
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're chasing i'll probably do that
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
after we can get through this early bill
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's a late bill so it'll probably be in
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's just been postponed because of
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
safety and security issues and being
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
able to house all the people we couldn't
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
oh we have 102 bills that's right yeah
 
01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.510 align:start position:0%
oh we have 102 bills that's right yeah
yeah

01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
we got the conversion bill coming up
 
01:44:13.199 --> 01:44:14.629 align:start position:0%
we got the conversion bill coming up
next

01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
a local district can spend what 80
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
percent on on a kid i think i haven't
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
seen that in law but
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
oh yeah that's the way it was written
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
you had to have uh the recommendation
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
the principal superintendent
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
and then you had the two-thirds of the
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
teachers had to approve this union
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah of course that's going to
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
raise hell here with the committee but
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just going to be very brief
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say this is what it does it
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
makes you know look at washington dc and
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
and how the charter schools are the
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
dominant achievers down there
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i think after katrina louisiana
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
went to all charter schools
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
louisiana louisiana well they did yeah
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.840 --> 01:47:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.840 --> 01:48:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.840 --> 01:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.840 --> 01:52:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.840 --> 01:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.840 --> 01:55:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.840 --> 01:57:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.840 --> 01:58:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.840 --> 01:59:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.840 --> 02:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.840 --> 02:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.840 --> 02:03:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.840 --> 02:04:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to our next bill
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
which is house bill 1132
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the application for a
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
charter conversion school
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
and uh i will recognize the prime
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli and members of the education
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is rick
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
ladd i come from haverhill new hampshire
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
and representing that area of grafton
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
county uh in introducing 1132 it's
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the application for charter
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
conversion schools we have in the
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
statute right now
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
a law which enables
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
charters to become charters by two
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
different routes one we've been talking
 
02:05:37.119 --> 02:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
different routes one we've been talking
about

02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
earlier is there's a separate funding
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
stream and if you become a charter
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
school you apply through the state board
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
of education etc
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
the charter conversion school is one
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
that can be done locally in your local
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
school district we've had one in the
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
past here i believe that's no longer in
 
02:05:53.599 --> 02:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
past here i believe that's no longer in
business

02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
but this what this bill does it removes
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
certain voting requirements that we
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
currently have in the
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
process of a public district deciding to
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
move into the charter conversion school
 
02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
move into the charter conversion school
format

02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
format
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it adds the requirement that you
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
have to have a majority vote of the
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
school district at a regular meeting to
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
attain that status as a charter
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
conversion school
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
in looking at the bill the way it is
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
right now there's a number of hurdles or
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
hoops one has to
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
cross before you can become a charter
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
conversion school
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
the charter conversion school right now
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
of course you have to have the
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
vote of the school board
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
to become a charter school but now you
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
also have to have several other hurdles
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
which you must cross
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
one of which is you have to have two
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
thirds four of the teachers employed
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
within the school district and
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
secondly you must have the written
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
approval of the superintendent and
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
principal of the school
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
right now it's my opinion that by having
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
the latter two requirements i spoke to
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
right now are just basically saying we
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
won't have any more charter conversion
 
02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.350 align:start position:0%
won't have any more charter conversion
schools

02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
that in order to get a two-thirds vote
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's like climbing a cliff that's
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
straight up and getting the written
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
permission of the superintendent and the
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
principal which i i feel often times
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't even live in the community i i
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
think that that's outmoded legislation
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
in itself
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
especially when we have superintendents
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
and principals to have a higher instance
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
of moving from one district to another
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and probably the
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
average 10-year superintendent used to
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
be about five years is probably less
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
than that right now we have 12 vacancies
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the state as at this current time
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
so what this does it just rewrites the
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislation inserts into you have to
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
have a majority vote of a special
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
meeting of the annual meeting or at a
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
special meeting
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that you have to have a warrant
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
article that's passed by your community
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
this would enable a school district then
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
to move down the route of having their
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
public school turned into a charter
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
public school and we know that there's
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
places in this country where charters
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
have shown better achievement results
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
i.e washington dc
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
where minority groups had an opportunity
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
to really
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
develop and expand their grow and expand
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
their achievement which that's
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by various instruments
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
which we assess something that nape and
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
aep which is given demonstrates that the
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels in that particular
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
city now with these charter schools is
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
much higher than it was prior to that
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
so i will close my testimony because
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's just that succinct that it changes
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
the format in the way of becoming a
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
charter conversion school which then the
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
costs are borne by the school district
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
they still have the responsibility for
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
funding the charter public conversion
 
02:08:49.199 --> 02:08:50.470 align:start position:0%
funding the charter public conversion
school

02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's controlled by that
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that board itself and the funding
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
comes through their allocation at 80
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
percent so that they have monies to run
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
the charter school thank you
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter saw your hand
 
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
representative porter saw your hand
first

02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
got it right up there thank you
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and thank you
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative lag so i'm not really
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with the rules that are working
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
around our conversion schools but i
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
understand that in charter schools um
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
only 50 percent of the teachers need to
 
02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:21.830 align:start position:0%
only 50 percent of the teachers need to
be

02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
certified teachers is that accurate that
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's true of the charter uh
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
public schools the ones we've been
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the charter conversion
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
school it's also true that okay so
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
can i answer your question no i had
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
because i have a follow-up so if if a
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
school decides a school district under
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
your bill decides to
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
go to a
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
charter conversion which i don't i'm not
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
against a charter conversion i think
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
there might be some good things to it
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
but if that um
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
were voted in by the district
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
half the certified teachers in the
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
district could be let go
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
and replaced with uncertified teachers
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
 
02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
i

02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that to move in that
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
direction a school board would be
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at where they are
 
02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:18.709 align:start position:0%
looking at where they are
and

02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
i i'm not familiar i wasn't in this
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
state when we had i believe was pace
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
the the charter school which was a
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
conversion i don't know how that tran
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
that transition occurred initially
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps there might be those that
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
behind me that may have a better handle
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
on that i i don't want to be subjective
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
and not give you an answer on that i i
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
just don't have the information
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative ellison thank you mr
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my my
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
question rick uh i raised this before in
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
previous discussions about
 
02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
previous discussions about
this

02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
this issue and i guess i'm just getting
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
back to it again and so what if since we
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't have any current
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
conver charter convergence schools what
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
to labor agreements that had been agreed
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
to in the school district and the school
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
board had signed and had in place
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
three-year labor agreements with their
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
teachers if in fact they then decided to
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
go to a
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
conversion school would those labor
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
agreements still be in effect
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's a technical question and perhaps
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
you might ask the
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
the department there they're available
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
for this one as well thank you
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
question could you put in a statement
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
or two of what the basic intent of this
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
well right now that
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that charter schools
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
provide that option that's necessary for
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of students and we know that we've
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
seen charter schools
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to call them conversions
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
whatever down in dc they work
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
and they're able to provide
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
students what they need the majority of
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
students what what is necessary for them
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
to grow and achieve
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
i i feel that it's it's an option we
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
ought to have available i know that
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions whether people
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be certified or non-certified or
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
whether for example like i always go
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
back to career tech but we have remember
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
how we looked for alternative
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
certification there where it was based
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
upon the history of the person working
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
in a technical field before they you
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
know and they retired and they were
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to come in and offer that school
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
some of their background information
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
rather than having the phd it's just
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
plain old mary mr brown or mrs brown
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
that has all that good technology and ex
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
understanding i believe that exists in
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
public education too
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we have folks that come in that are
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily certified but are
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:12:59.830 --> 02:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
what is the intent
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
by removing
 
02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
by removing
the

02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
any input by the people that are running
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
or involved in the particular school
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
because the conversion charter school
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
is actually where
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
let's say there's an elementary school
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
in bradford new hampshire
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
and all that's part of the kearsarge
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
district and they decide well that's let
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
me take an easier one grantham has an
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
elementary school they aren't part of a
 
02:13:29.599 --> 02:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
elementary school they aren't part of a
co-op

02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
the town decides that they want a
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
charter school and that they'd like to
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
use the charter school that's that's the
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
grantham elementary school
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
and so they put it on the warren article
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
i assume that's when it's taken at the
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
end regular annual meeting that would be
 
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
a warrant article and um
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
so what you're doing is
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's your intent of taking out
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
teachers and the input of the educators
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
and the professionals
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
at that particular school what's the
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
intent of that
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
change is tough in education
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
we have a system that's entrenched
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
and some call it bureaucratic i call it
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's just an entrenched system
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's always last to seize and
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
recognize often that change
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
benefits all
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and that we're in business not for the
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
money i put in my pocket but to help the
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
students and and provide them that
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
choice of what's best for them if in
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
fact the community says we're looking at
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
this and we see this is a better option
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
for our students and we'd like to see
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
what the charter conversion can provide
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
versus the way we're doing it right now
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to though that the
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
majority of voters in that town to make
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
that decision i do not think it's the
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
job of an employee
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
to make that decision i don't think it's
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
the job of the teacher or the principal
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
to make that decision this education
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
system we have in america is for the
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
students and the public and therefore
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is to me is a logical thing that
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
would go to the regular board regular
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
meeting of the town or a special meeting
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
to make that choice in that decision
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and go on from where the decisions
 
02:15:16.159 --> 02:15:18.550 align:start position:0%
and and go on from where the decisions
made

02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative ladd for taking my
 
02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.109 align:start position:0%
representative ladd for taking my
question

02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
so when you make the comparison to the
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
district of columbia you're talking
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses what's going to
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
happen in a district where a town has a
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
single public school
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
convert that school into a charter
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
option i don't object to choice
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
but if you have one public school in a
 
02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.709 align:start position:0%
but if you have one public school in a
town

02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits of
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
converting that school to a charter in
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
your charter you could write for example
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
if we have a public library in that
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
small town
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to duplicate that
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
public library in that school
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
you could provide that resource without
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
having to have somebody with that
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
credential you could have a public
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
librarian that's had his expertise in
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
the field you could also have then the
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
services that are provided to these
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
students to achieve the academic areas
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
provided by people that maybe aren't
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
licensed and you know and i know there's
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of people here that don't agree
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
with that but i i feel that it's a
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
viable option and if the community deems
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
it that's where we want to go they ought
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
to have the choice to do so
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:16:46.719 --> 02:16:48.150 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public schools
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative are consistently
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
high flyers we score at the top of
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
public education scales
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh who's going to make this
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
determination and based on what that
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
somehow or another the needs of the
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
students are not being met in a
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
community that has one public school
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
well i'll leave
 
02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:16.709 align:start position:0%
well i'll leave
we've

02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
had a little discussion on that so far
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
we had a budget bill coming the other
 
02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.190 align:start position:0%
we had a budget bill coming the other
day

02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with performance outcomes
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
and we know the performance outcome in
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
that district versus that district's not
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
always the same
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
we also know that we like to boast in
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
this state that are our children are
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
highly educated and rank always in the
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
top five states in the country as far as
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
achievement and achievement
 
02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.389 align:start position:0%
achievement and achievement
um

02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
where's the bar placed though you know
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
when we look at our achievement scores
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
in mathematics
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
if we're in the top five
 
02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:51.030 align:start position:0%
if we're in the top five
wow

02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
wow
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
that that's a real concern to me whereas
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
i know now the proficiency level
 
02:17:56.399 --> 02:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
i know now the proficiency level
is

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
very very low that bar is a low bar
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
and when we have 48 percent we used to
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
have in mathematics
 
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:07.990 align:start position:0%
have in mathematics
achieving

02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
achieving
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
where we want them at proficient or
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
higher and now it's only 38
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
i would say that if i were looking at uh
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
my child being in education i would say
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
wow uh what can we do to improve this
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
and we've been on this steady flat line
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
or even a declining line for years it's
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
not all result of
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
covid or the pandemic
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to be making the gains
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to see and it's concerning
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking now is maybe the
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
structure of how we function the
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
organization how we function
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
issues out there that i
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
have always advocated that it's not
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
going to be necessarily a dollar that
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
nets achievement and growth
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the attitude of those
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
teaching in that in that building or in
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
that site it's going to be the
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
administration and supervision
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the aspiration of the
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
community it's going to be the
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
involvement of parents it's going to be
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the leadership
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
and the expectation there are a lot of
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
issues come into play of achievement
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
that you can't always
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
gauge by a dollar bill and i've seen
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
schools that are very in poor areas the
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
achievement levels in some of those
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
small k-8 schools is high
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
and that what's the common denominator
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
good teaching
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
good parent commitment and involvement
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
and on on the list goes all those
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
tangibles that you have to measure a
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
different way
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative boehm
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question wouldn't it also be
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
in large town like derry even hudson
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
where they have multiple
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
public schools multiple elementary
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
schools multiple middle schools that
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
more of what this could be
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
charter schools provide options you
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
could have one in a town like that um
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's i oftentimes look at the
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
charter school in my neck of the woods
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it's the only one but it's one of
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
the finest charter schools you can north
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
country charter which there's a high
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of those youngsters which are
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
special services within that facility we
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
all have a seat or so
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
to go there from the various committed
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
districts the superintendents got
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
together and we we put this thing
 
02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:23.190 align:start position:0%
together and we we put this thing
together

02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
there there's a need for it there may be
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
a need for having a charter conversion
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
school within a school district and you
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
could put that on the warrant and you
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
could you know it's we've had those
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
optional type schools located in in many
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
states i had there were a number of them
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
when i was up in alaska and anchorage
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
which we had schools which were highly
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
oriented in the sciences there are some
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
that were old-fashioned with their
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
discipline and that was part of their
 
02:20:46.479 --> 02:20:48.070 align:start position:0%
discipline and that was part of their
charter

02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
charter
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
so um i think there's a place for this
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
in our society i'm not saying it's good
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody but i think for us to get
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
there we're never going to get there if
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
you have two-thirds vote of those which
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
are employed in the building
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you uh
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh cordelia remember the lag
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning again nice to
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
see you in a formal way i can ask you
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions i hope this
 
02:21:11.359 --> 02:21:12.389 align:start position:0%
questions i hope this
but

02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's just clarity eric on
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
line three it hasn't changed it says an
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
existing public school may vote
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
by school board so that's that's step
 
02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.150 align:start position:0%
by school board so that's that's step
one

02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
and then it goes into the continuation
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
using the school district and the the
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
the warrant those things yeah so it's
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
actually a two-part process it's a
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
process yes so so the first part is it
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
has to be the public school school or
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
that school
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
correct so the that's the first question
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you the second one you referenced
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
multiple times the success of the
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
in washington dc
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
do you know if the funding level of the
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
school in washington dc is similar to
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
the final level of the public school in
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
washington dc
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know what their funding level is
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
but there again it speaks to what i just
 
02:21:58.399 --> 02:21:59.429 align:start position:0%
but there again it speaks to what i just
did

02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
said a few moments ago i don't think
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's always the dollar
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
and these charter conversion schools
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be operating on less dollars than
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
the current system within that community
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
my thing was my thinking was perhaps the
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
the public school was funded at a much
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
higher rate yeah be helpful to them and
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
the third thing i just want to follow up
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
on representative mullen's point
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
she indicated the lack of the school
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
folks in the decision particularly in a
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
single school system
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
and your response was if i heard it
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
right that that they could use the
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
public library and they could use other
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
things to help the academic resources it
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
sounds to me
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
like what what you're really saying is
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is a dollar issue this is a cost
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
savings issue you're outsourcing you're
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
outsourcing a lot of the services that
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
our current uh school professional
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
people provide
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's a definite benefit yes you know
 
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit anytime you can save a
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollar that's huge in terms of property
 
02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
dollar that's huge in terms of property
taxes

02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you just want to make sure that
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of that thank you
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt thank you mr
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh would you believe and then i'll
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may uh would you believe
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
that i once served on a school board in
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
sau 48 the biggest sau in the state nine
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
towns and the superintendent uh wanted
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
to have one of those towns one of the
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
schools problematical
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh converted to a charter school that
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
was from the superintendent uh and of
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
course given the current law it was
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
daunting and almost impossible would you
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
believe that that that occurred
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
i believe anything you say represent
 
02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.190 align:start position:0%
i believe anything you say represent
moffitt

02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
moffitt
 
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
moffitt
yes

02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up to that is uh if as i
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
read this proposal this proposed
 
02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
read this proposal this proposed
legislation

02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
removes that two-thirds
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
faculty requirement as well as the
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent and principles
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
requirement and as i mentioned earlier
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
my superintendent wanted
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
the charter conversion process so my
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly is it correct
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
that 51 percent of the voters in the
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
district could could
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
bring about a conversion despite the
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
opposition of faculty and administration
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
the the faculty and administration would
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
no longer be part of this equation it
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
would just be the majority vote as
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying and the recommendation you
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
know existing public school may by a
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
vote of the school board so you have
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
and then you have the process of that
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
vote and you have to have the warrant
 
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
vote and you have to have the warrant
article

02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
got it thank you you're welcome
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:37.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
representative

02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.150 align:start position:0%
representative
so

02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
three-part question
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
if a
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
a town that has one public school
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
goes to a charter who is responsible for
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
the special ed program and how is that
 
02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.309 align:start position:0%
the special ed program and how is that
funded

02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
second part
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
what about the budget does the town
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
still get to vote on the budget for the
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
school district or is there no longer a
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
school district it's a charter school so
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
what public oversight do we have of that
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
and three would there still be a school
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
board or would it go to a board of
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
directors that's not elected
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
those are all technical questions and we
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
do have the folks behind me with those
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
technical answers but yes you will have
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
special education services provided
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
because this is a dollar which still
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
comes from the state of new hampshire to
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
the charter public school conversion
 
02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
the charter public school conversion
school

02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
question i can't understand from reading
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
this how this would work in manchester
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
the largest sau in new hampshire
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have all your schools
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
as charter conversion schools you could
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
have one maybe uh some of those
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
elementaries that you have now could be
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
turned over to a charter conversion
 
02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
turned over to a charter conversion
school

02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up my question is how it would go
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
about happening because we don't have
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
annual meetings warrants
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
or the governing charter
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
which the people on the charter have to
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
be elected and have long meetings and
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
then the citizens vote on the charter
 
02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.630 align:start position:0%
then the citizens vote on the charter
and

02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
i would suggest you move to haverhill
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
this one this would not be able to
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought
 
02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought
to

02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
what the tenor of a school district
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
would be in which the superintendent the
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
principal and the teachers
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be told
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
employed in a conversion charter the
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
following year without any input or
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
a mass exodus of teachers or whether or
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
not the superintendent and the principal
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
are now out the door or
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out in my head
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
how this is going to play out in real
 
02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:06.070 align:start position:0%
how this is going to play out in real
life

02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
in real life i'm sure that the community
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes that mrs smith being a
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
superlative teacher would keep that
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
superlative teacher in the charter
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
if myth
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
but mrs smith will have to give up the
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system
 
02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:28.830 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system
and

02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining benefits that
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
come with being employed in a public
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
school is that no i i can't answer that
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
right now we're getting now into
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
retirement and i have not looked into
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
the retirement or
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
aspect as far as when you get out after
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
so many years you get this
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that as a public school
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
teacher and if you're still certified
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're still working within a public
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
institution and you'd qualify for that
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:28:04.469 --> 02:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
see none
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much it's
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
we all agree
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%

02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
education administrators and i don't
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
have written testimony just a few
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions so that i can better inform
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
our members i'm wondering if we can get
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of clarification in regards
 
02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
a little bit of clarification in regards
to

02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
how special education would work
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the resident
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
district is the lea this would now be a
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
who would be the lea
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
really this is
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
really not the time to be asking if he
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh
 
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh
contact

02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
contact
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative ladd and ask him or maybe
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative from the department uh
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
might have some input to that
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay so i will just pose questions then
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
i guess that would be one of them and
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i would also ask the question is
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
this open enrollment so i would use
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
manchester as an example if one of the
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
elementary schools decided that they
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
were going to become a conversion
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
charter school could
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
kids from other elementary schools leave
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
how does that all work when it comes to
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
special education
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if that's been thought
 
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.230 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if that's been thought
through

02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
the the special education aspects brings
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
forward a lot of questions and i'm
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if if that's been a part of
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
the thinking
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
if there are any details around that
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is just a public hearing we're
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
receiving your input so thank you very
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
were there any questions i'm sorry
 
02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:39.270 align:start position:0%
were there any questions i'm sorry
no

02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
good morning nate greene new hampshire
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure yeah i can try to hit the ones that
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
i was trying to take some notes here and
 
02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
i was trying to take some notes here and
listen

02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
listen
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
so maybe i'll start with uh i know there
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
were some questions around uh unions and
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining um so there is a
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
section within charter law that governs
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
governs collective bargaining uh and
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
unions within charter schools themselves
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm just gonna
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
scroll down so i can give the correct
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
rsa so rsa 194b
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
14 applies to collective bargaining
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the cases of chartered public schools
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
charter school employees can form
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining units those
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining units have to be
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
separate from any other collective
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining units that might exist so if
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about charter conversion
 
02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
we're talking about charter conversion
schools

02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
the teachers within the charter
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
conversion school would be able to form
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
a collective bargaining unit but it
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
would not be able to be the same
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit as the one
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's in the district and that's
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
because there is a different board of
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
trustees over the charter school and for
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes the board of
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
trustees is considered the employer
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
which is separate from the local school
 
02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
which is separate from the local school
board

02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
i know that was a question as well
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
whether local school board would have
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
authority versus whether there would be
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
a board of trustees
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
they do operate in partnership and local
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
school board members can sit on the
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
board of trustees over the charter
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
school but there has to be a level of
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
distinction and they cannot be the same
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
makeup so you can't have the local
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
school board be
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees but you can have
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
membership across both of those
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the question representative ellison
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh let me take that
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
one step further then
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
given the what if
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
if we have a three-year negotiated
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
agreement between
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
the local school board
 
02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
and teachers union for example and in
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
the first after the first year of that
 
02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
the first after the first year of that
agreement

02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the town the school board decides to go
 
02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
the town the school board decides to go
to

02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
a charter conversion does that negate
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
the last two years of the existing labor
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
contract that that's in fact in effect
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
i would love to defer that question to
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
someone that has a legal background or
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney because we're getting into
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
contract law and education law there and
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm the best person to
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
answer what would occur in that what if
 
02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
answer what would occur in that what if
scenario

02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative luno
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
very much dr green for uh being with us
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
again today um representative ladd in
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
his introduction spoke about the um the
 
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:20.469 align:start position:0%
his introduction spoke about the um the
potential

02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:33:22.389 --> 02:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
savings to the school district if the
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
school district was to go in the
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
direction of a conversion
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
charter school and i was wondering if
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
you could speak a little bit to
 
02:33:30.399 --> 02:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
you could speak a little bit to
how

02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
how conversion charters are funded
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
state board
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
authorized charters sure so the funding
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism is a little bit different
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
because the funding mechanism still
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
comes from the
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
local dollars and so if you have a
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
charter school that's a charter
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
conversion school essentially it's run
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
by the local district it's funded at no
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
less than eighty percent of the per
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
pupil cost of the students that are in
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
that district um so if you were to fund
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
the charter school at that 80 percent
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
you would be looking at a 20 cost in
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the per pupil expenditures
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
you can as a district open up your
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
charter school then to other surrounding
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
towns and you could develop tuition
 
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
agreements with other towns where they
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
would then send their students and you
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be able to have varying
 
02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
levels of tuition agreements at that
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
point that would not necessarily
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
be governed by that 80 percent local
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
district funding so for my example if a
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
student came from a town that was not
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
part of the district the that local
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
district would not be responsible for
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
that student the state would pick up the
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
cost of that particular student just
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
like any other state charter school so
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
in a charter conversion school you you
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
may have two different streams of
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
funding the state stream of funding that
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
would come in for non-resident students
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then the local funding for resident
 
02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
and then the local funding for resident
students

02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
so follow up on that yes thanks so so
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
just clarifying a couple of points there
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
um uh if you could sort of you know
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
repeat and maybe rephrase how the how
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
the state funding works for um
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
for students non-resident students
 
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
attending a
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
a school district chartered conversion
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
and also whether a conversion charter
 
02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:14.469 align:start position:0%
and also whether a conversion charter
school

02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:35:14.479 --> 02:35:16.150 align:start position:0%
school
receives

02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
receives
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
any direct
 
02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
any direct
funding

02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
as as
 
02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:24.469 align:start position:0%
as as
a

02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
state board authorized charters do
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
sure so it's a little bit difficult
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
because right now it's a hypothetical we
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't have one that's operating within
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
but if it was a state student so a
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-resident student attending they
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
would receive the base adequacy payment
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
that the state pays for any other
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
chartered school student in the state as
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
well as any other differentiated aid
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
that might be part of that student if
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're a free and reduced lunch student
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
third grade reading special education
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
those particular amounts are all
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
dictated by the state for that
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
particular fiscal year
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
for the local resident students they
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be funded by that local
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
set of dollars at no less than 80
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
percent of the per pupil cost and then i
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe the state would still pay the
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid amounts that go into
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay and a final follow-up on that
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
and you you just mentioned that the
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have any operated
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
or operating conversion charters right
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
now we have had one in the past what
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh i think with uh some of the dwindling
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment that they were seeing uh and
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the costs that were associated with uh
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
upkeep of that particular program they
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
determined just within the past year
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they were going to close that
 
02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:34.309 align:start position:0%
that they were going to close that
school

02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and because the school was operated by
 
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
the school district it was a district
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
and local decision and so the state did
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
not have uh much of a role in terms of
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
that particular school closing as we
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
would if it was a state charter school
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you mr chair
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm taking my question
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
the school is not would be a charter
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
school so there would no longer be an
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
elected school board that was running it
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
it would be a board of directors that
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be appointed with maybe a few
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
school board members on it is that what
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying yes okay can i follow up
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
on that so
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
when it's time for the local voters to
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
approve a budget
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
do they get that opportunity how does
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
that work if they don't have an elected
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
school board
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
to to work up the budget and it's not a
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
public school anymore
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
how do they how do i as a voter get to
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
say yes i approve this budget no i don't
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
approve this budget sure so in terms of
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
the funding for a charter conversion
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
school or any chartered public school
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
that is being uh opened by a local
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
district so a district run charter
 
02:37:46.319 --> 02:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
district so a district run charter
school

02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is in addition to the charter that
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
sets out the programmatic offerings of
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
the school there is a contract between
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
the non-profit and the board of trustees
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the charter school and the local
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
district and the school board
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and that contract sets out the funding
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism the rate at which the charter
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
school will be paid by the local
 
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
school will be paid by the local
district

02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:08.630 align:start position:0%
district
the

02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
different services that the charter
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
school is going to then provide based on
 
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
that funding and the contract is put
 
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
before the town as part of a warrant
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
article and the town has to vote on that
 
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
article and the town has to vote on that
yes

02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.190 align:start position:0%
yes
so

02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
who writes that charter
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
who writes that
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
application uh it could be a variety of
 
02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:31.110 align:start position:0%
application uh it could be a variety of
people

02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
teachers are involved and the
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent's not involved and the
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
school board is not involved
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
who is writing the charter
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
so within rsa there are three different
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
groups or three different types of
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
people that can start a charter school
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
so it would have to be one of those
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
groups generally it's done with
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative so my assumption is that
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
if a school board and a local district
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
is looking at doing a charter school is
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to involve local members probably
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the school board and any anybody else
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
interested in setting up and running and
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
operating that particular school it's
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
usually a group of people that are
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
considered the founders of the school
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
that write those documents the document
 
02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
itself does have to be approved both by
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
the local school board as well as by the
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
state board of education prior to going
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
before the town for a warrant article on
 
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
before the town for a warrant article on
the

02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
one more so
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
why would we want to go this route and
 
02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
not perhaps make our public school a
 
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
public magnet school
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
and open it and keep
 
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:37.190 align:start position:0%
and open it and keep
keep

02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
a school board and a budget and all that
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and options for kids and
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
attract kids from other places
 
02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
attract kids from other places
then

02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
then become a
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
it makes me very nervous when we have a
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
non-elected board overseeing money that
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
comes from my personal taxes that makes
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
me a little nervous so i guess i would
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
like to know how i can be less nervous
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
and why aren't we talking about magnet
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
schools and not
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so i would say i probably can't speak
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
to whatever the intention would be
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
because i think you know this is a very
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
local decision that we're talking about
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
being made and so i think there could be
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
a variety of different intentions in
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
creating a district sponsored charter
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
school or a charter conversion school
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i i really don't want to
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know put words in other people's
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
mouths you know because i'm not sure
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
what each individual town within the
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
state might be considering when they're
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
making these kinds of decisions um the
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
one thing i would say is that the
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
pathway already exists within state
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
statute it has been from pretty much day
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
one when we created charter schools
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
within the state so any district right
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
now can create a district sponsored
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
charter school that would exist in the
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
same manner and structure that i've
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
proposed here it's just this particular
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill looks at the pathway where a local
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
public school would become a charter
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
school but a district can create a
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
district sponsored charter school now in
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
a very similar pathway
 
02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
a very similar pathway
representative

02:40:58.150 --> 02:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:00.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you a hyper a question
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
based on a hypothetical but i hope you
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
can answer it
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:08.550 align:start position:0%
so there's
s-a-u-x-y

02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
s-a-u-x-y
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay and s-a-u-x-y has one school
 
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's say it goes k through
 
02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:15.670 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's say it goes k through
eight

02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.870 align:start position:0%
eight
and

02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
and
the

02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
people in the town are agitated and so
 
02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
they decide that they're going to
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
they decide that they're going to
[Music]

02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
convert that to a charter school all
 
02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:27.190 align:start position:0%
convert that to a charter school all
right

02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't that dissolve
 
02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
doesn't that dissolve
s-a-u-x-y

02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
s-a-u-x-y
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't that
 
02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:34.870 align:start position:0%
doesn't that
dissolve

02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
dissolve
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
school district uh you know x-y
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i think
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
the question is if there's no school
 
02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
the question is if there's no school
district

02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
no sau left because now it's charter and
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's gone over to a board of trustees
 
02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for special ed that's
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
come up like two or three times and
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't been answered it's been kind of
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
goofed around a little bit
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
um and what's what does the comm
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
community if at all when they're raising
 
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:08.230 align:start position:0%
community if at all when they're raising
taxes

02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh they're still still going to be
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
raising swept taxes
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how else it affects
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
funding maybe representative luna can
 
02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
get to that but if the if the district
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
is dissolved and the sau is essentially
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
dissolved the school board's dissolved
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
please answer directly about the special
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
ed but then the ramifications for
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh collecting property taxes related to
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
schools how can they even
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
collect property taxes for a local
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
school if a local school doesn't exist
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
and what happens to the statewide
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
so there wouldn't be able to be a
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
situation in which the sau or the local
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
school board would be able to dissolve
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
because they're the only ones that have
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
that ability to do the local taxation
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
they have to exist because the contract
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
for running the chartered school is done
 
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
with the local school board
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
in a similar way to the way we operate
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
pinkerton academy or co brown where they
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
are public academies essentially they're
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations but they
 
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
contract with a variety of local school
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
boards and saus to provide the public
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
school services for the students that
 
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
attend there this would be a very
 
02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:23.510 align:start position:0%
attend there this would be a very
similar

02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
type of relationship or situation where
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
the chartered school would provide the
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
education and the services but they're
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
doing so under a contract through the
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
local school board and so the local
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
school board would have to continue to
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
exist they would have to continue to
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide the taxation base in order to
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
operate that charter school it's just
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
that instead of doing that through a
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
public school in the current traditional
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
structure they'll be doing that through
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
a contract with the chartered school
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
which would have as well its own board
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
of trustees
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the special education that's
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
another reason why the local school
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
board and the sau would have to continue
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
to exist because they would still have a
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility for providing those
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
special education services to the
 
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
charter school most likely through the
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
contract language that they would have
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
in setting up that charter conversion
 
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.110 align:start position:0%
in setting up that charter conversion
school

02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
could i follow up on that
 
02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:10.389 align:start position:0%
could i follow up on that
yes

02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:44:10.399 --> 02:44:11.670 align:start position:0%
yes
so

02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have a school you've got a uh
 
02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
you don't have a school you've got a uh
sau

02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
sau
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
the sau
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that has to has to exist which i don't
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
know if that's in statute or not i'd i'd
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
be very
 
02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
be very
um

02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
interested to see if that in statute so
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
in order to have an sau you have to have
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
a superintendent
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that's and probably this you have to
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
have a business manager and you have to
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a few other things but they aren't
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
able to set a budget
 
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.269 align:start position:0%
able to set a budget
because

02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees are running the
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
ghost school in that particular
 
02:44:46.399 --> 02:44:49.110 align:start position:0%
ghost school in that particular
sau

02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
it just uh
 
02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.230 align:start position:0%
it just uh
i

02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's been
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughly thought through on this whole
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
thing but in these small districts in
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
the north
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
and west and probably even
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
some you know the
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
there was a real push to combine schools
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden school started
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
breaking apart
 
02:45:09.279 --> 02:45:10.309 align:start position:0%
breaking apart
um

02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
and there are saus where there's only
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
one school
 
02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:15.349 align:start position:0%
one school
and

02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
it just seems
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
how to how
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
how your question where in statute is
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
that that you've got to have an sau if
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have a school
 
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
i would have to take a look at that yeah
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the very least you'd have to have the
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
school board because that's the
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
contracting entity so the school board
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
has to continue to exist and because the
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
charter schools are public entities
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
is publicly available and the budget
 
02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be part of the contract with the
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
local school board so the local school
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
board would provide the funding the
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
budget piece would be would come from
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
the charter school
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up please okay
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
how did the conversion school
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
go back to being a regular school or did
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
it or did it just fall did did all of a
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
sudden it just crumbled the whole
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
so the the charter school that had
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
closed was pace charter school in
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
pembroke it was a district-sponsored
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
charter school i don't believe it
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
started out as a charter conversion
 
02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
school it was a district-sponsored
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so when they closed the students
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
that were attending that just went back
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the schools that were within the
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
district already
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
i guess and there was no
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
there was no input from the teachers or
 
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
the community that um had to vote that
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
this conversion school was all of a
 
02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:41.269 align:start position:0%
this conversion school was all of a
sudden

02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
02:46:41.279 --> 02:46:42.870 align:start position:0%
sudden
defunct

02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
defunct
 
02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
no it was operated by a board of
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
trustees and so they had to take a vote
 
02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh for taking
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to ask a question thank
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
you doctor for taking my question so i
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
want to go back to eliminating the
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent the principal and the
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
teachers from the decision-making
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
process here to
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
opening statements that you made about
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.309 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
so

02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's now my understanding that the
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
teachers the employees in the
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
charter conversion could in fact
 
02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:28.469 align:start position:0%
charter conversion could in fact
unionize

02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
unionize
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
but they could not be part of
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh for lack of
 
02:47:34.399 --> 02:47:35.269 align:start position:0%
uh for lack of
uh

02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
just so we're speaking common language
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
they could not be part of
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
nea new hampshire
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
or aft new hampshire
 
02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:44.790 align:start position:0%
or aft new hampshire
if

02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
somebody on the staff had been
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
part of that unit prior to this
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
so they could still theoretically be
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
part of na new hampshire or aft they
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
just would not be able to be part of the
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
same collective bargaining unit that
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
they had been when it was the
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
traditional public school so that
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
particular collective bargaining unit
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
that was governed by that specific
 
02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:06.389 align:start position:0%
that was governed by that specific
contract

02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
got it okay but they could be conversion
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
school number one
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes collective bargaining unit um i had
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
a second question that i asked
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative vlad oh could i have a
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative thank you
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh i had a second question that i asked
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative vlad i don't know if you
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this but um
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
it has been my understanding and i would
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
love for you to correct me if i'm wrong
 
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
love for you to correct me if i'm wrong
that

02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
teachers that are employed in the
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
charter school system
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
are not part of the new hampshire
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system am i correct in that
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the statute actually does allow
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
charter school teachers to be part of
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
the state retirement system
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you're a teacher in a charter school
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
you can elect to be part of that system
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
and the years that you've taught in a
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public chartered school
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
can count as service towards the teacher
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
who pays the portion of the school i i
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
mean as it stands right now a faculty
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
member will pay in their contribution
 
02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then the school pays in theirs
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
who um
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
who who does that in the charter
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversion equation so my guess was that
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
would be probably have to be part of the
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
contract that they would set up um and
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
it could be part of collective
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements that they go
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
through as part of setting up that
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
charter conversion school
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:36.710 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
moffatt

02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
moffatt
 
02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
rogue thank you mr chair and by the way
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
earlier when i said sau 48 was the large
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
one of the largest districts i meant
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
geographically as not in terms of
 
02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
population just to be clear
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
so right now according to statute if a
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
conversion is sought
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
it could be blocked by two-thirds of the
 
02:49:58.230 --> 02:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
faculty vote and my question
 
02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh is that given that many districts
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
feature faculty members who live out of
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
district that start i can think of and i
 
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
know of many districts where most of the
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
teachers don't live in the district
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
so according to current statute
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
am i correct to understand that
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
faculty members who don't even live in
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
the district could thwart the will of
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
the local people who may want a
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
conversion or is that two-thirds vote is
 
02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
what they get to vote whether they live
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
in district or not is that is that
 
02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:31.429 align:start position:0%
in district or not is that is that
accurate

02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
so the way the current statute is set up
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it just refers to two-thirds of the
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
faculty so it's regardless of residency
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
whether they live in the district or not
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
one question for representative woodcock
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you roberto i appreciate that i
 
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted
 
02:50:52.630 --> 02:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard you say during the
 
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
early part of your testimony
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
that you referred to this as your bill
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
did you write the the
 
02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
scripts for this bill uh no no i'm sorry

okay
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
i do not i see representative porter's
 
02:52:36.309 --> 02:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative ford
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
is a somewhat more general question a
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
lot of the ones that have preceded
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
earlier been talking about specific
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of how would this affect this
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
group isn't most of this considered
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
just a general process you would go
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
through when you have change of any sort
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
and then wages and conditions of
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
employment would be handled through
 
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation and that sort of thing and
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so it would shift with whatever the
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
employer is now this group instead of
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
that group but the entity still stands
 
02:53:15.269 --> 02:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
as a school or whatever
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i would i would agree with that
 
02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
this just creates a different uh
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
structure and framework for that to
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
happen within well my
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
my experience being with universities
 
02:53:26.309 --> 02:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
but when suddenly universities decide to
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
do away with deans and the dean is the
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
first person you grieve against
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
then how do you continue with your
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
contract and then you negotiate how
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to do that sort of thing
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
that just seems to me to be a process
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
thing that all this would work out
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
i was there
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to answer that
 
02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
as a question or is
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so my understanding of the bill is
 
02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
yeah so my understanding of the bill is
so

02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a process that exists
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
now for chartered conversion schools and
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill changes the process
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
by which that chartered public school
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
comes into being
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh doctor uh i see
 
02:54:09.429 --> 02:54:09.439 align:start position:0%

but again i'm going to do this every
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
time we sit down
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
for those reps that owe me blurbs and
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee reports
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
please attend to them because this is
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to snowball on us you know we're
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to end up having more and more and
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
more and so please get those together we
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
did a great job getting through all that
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
stuff yesterday
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
let's just complete that job by getting
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
the reports in
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%

i'm the prime sponsor of house bill 1212
 
04:04:43.590 --> 04:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
an act relative to charges for chartered
 
04:04:46.309 --> 04:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
public school transportation i'm also in
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
support of the bill as it is
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
before i launch into this
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
testimony which in fact i've provided a
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
written copy for each of you that i know
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
is distributed by the clerk thank you
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to give a small background
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
on charter school
 
04:05:05.439 --> 04:05:07.030 align:start position:0%
on charter school
busing

04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
busing
 
04:05:09.429 --> 04:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
the way it works and this is for my next
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill as well so it'll be helpful
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
is located
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
can ride the district's buses to and
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
from school
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
if you are a resident of manchester
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
and you attend a manchester charter
 
04:05:30.080 --> 04:05:31.349 align:start position:0%
and you attend a manchester charter
school

04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
you can ride manchester buses to and
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
from your charter school
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
if you live in windham
 
04:05:43.030 --> 04:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack bedford amherst
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
and you attend a manchester charter
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
school you cannot
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
take manchester buses
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
to and from that school
 
04:05:54.150 --> 04:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's the background
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
now for the bill
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools can make
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
their own school schedules and calendars
 
04:06:04.080 --> 04:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
their own school schedules and calendars
independently

04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
independently
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
from the school districts where they are
 
04:06:07.840 --> 04:06:09.510 align:start position:0%
from the school districts where they are
located

04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
located
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
thus there are days
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
when the chartered public school may
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
have a full or a half day
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
when the school district where the
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
charter school resides does not
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
a chartered school
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
located in manchester
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
may have school
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
on a day the manchester school district
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
because it's election day
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
and the manchester public schools are
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
being used
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
for polling locations but the charter
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
school is not
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
so the charter school independently
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
making their schedule making their
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
calendar submitting it on time
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
designates election day as a day when
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
they have school
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
when the manchester school district
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
on such occasions
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
the chartered public school
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
as as in the example i just gave
 
04:07:13.990 --> 04:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
should not
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
be charged
 
04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
for bus transportation on that day
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
if the public school district calendar
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
is not an exact match to the public
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
chartered schools calendar
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
then this cannot result in an excess fee
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the chartered public
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier in my bill this
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
morning and i mention it again
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is part of a series that comes
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
from the ground up
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
this has been experienced at public
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
charter schools this is a real situation
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
in real time it happens
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
and was requested of me that no charter
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
schools best as i mentioned in this room
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
collectively at lunch actually we were
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
talking i think we now have over 100
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
years worth collectively of charter
 
04:08:06.070 --> 04:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
school experience
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
here with us
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
so with that intro i want to conclude my
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
opening remarks i know there are those
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
that want to testify after me and thank
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
you so much once again for your
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
attention thank you very much are there
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:08:21.359 --> 04:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
any questions
yes

04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr chair
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
mooney for uh bringing this in this
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon is this going to affect the
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
calculation of base adequacy under 198
 
04:08:32.880 --> 04:08:34.469 align:start position:0%
calculation of base adequacy under 198
40a

04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
40a
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know representative i thank you for
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
that question and at the precise moment
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
you got to the crunch of the question
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
that door slammed and i'm sorry i didn't
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
quite catch the most pivotal point of
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
your question if you could repeat sure
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh so as you're probably
 
04:08:47.840 --> 04:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh so as you're probably
aware

04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
aware
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
our um current school funding formula
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
includes a uh
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
the most significant component of which
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh is called base adequacy yes and um
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uh uh that base advocacy cost was
 
04:09:03.760 --> 04:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
and uh uh that base advocacy cost was
calculated

04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
i believe in
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
2014 and occluded and it includes a
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
transportation component so i'm
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if this will since this is a
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
requirement on public schools to provide
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
transportation beyond what what those
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
schools would be providing for their own
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
needs would would it then affect the
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
calculation of the base adequacy cost
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh i know
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
there will be those that testify after
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
me i would say no because it wasn't
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
enlisted on the fiscal note
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
and to me your question makes so much
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
sense and would be so uh evident there
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
but i don't see that here so i'm going
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
to have to
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
based on the bill i see and uh and its
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i had a similar
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
type question so i'm just follow it up
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
when we initially set up uh base cost in
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy back in the
 
04:10:01.840 --> 04:10:03.670 align:start position:0%
adequacy back in the
2008

04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
2008
 
04:10:03.680 --> 04:10:04.950 align:start position:0%
2008
uh

04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
we we had an amount of 3456 dollars as
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
base cost of that three thousand four
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
fifty six dollars i believe three
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty dollars of it was made up
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
of from for transportation for those
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
students within that district
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
now now we're talking about students
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
which are above and beyond that district
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
that are charter school students
 
04:10:27.680 --> 04:10:31.349 align:start position:0%
that are charter school students
right

04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i'm talking about too
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
that the school district doesn't receive
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
base adequacy for those students that
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
are not attending
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's where i'm going
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh they're not part of our adm a
 
04:10:45.680 --> 04:10:46.710 align:start position:0%
uh they're not part of our adm a
so

04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
not receiving that funding
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
is it then not a a financial cost i'm
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note which says is
 
04:10:53.840 --> 04:10:55.429 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note which says is
indeterminable

04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
but there is that caption at the end
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
therefore the additional transportation
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
costs if any the public school district
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
will financially be
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
financially responsible for under this
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
proposed bill is indeterminable so that
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
it means that
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
the district's going to be responsible
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
for the cost of this
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
additional day or two or three that
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
how you see it
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes because that's why the district asks
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
the charter school chart tries to charge
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
the charter school
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
for those extra days
 
04:11:30.319 --> 04:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
for those extra days
yes

04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion others after me may so just
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
my follow-up so the charter school is
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
going to be receiving funding from the
 
04:11:38.239 --> 04:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
going to be receiving funding from the
state

04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
to incorporate that cost built into that
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
base adequacy that they receive
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
so they are receiving the money but it's
 
04:11:46.880 --> 04:11:48.389 align:start position:0%
so they are receiving the money but it's
being

04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's needed on the other side of the
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
coin for those extra days
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
well that's where i appreciate that and
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's where this bill i think would
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
clarify things on that very subject
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:12:04.159 --> 04:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
is your intent with this bill
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
to uh state that uh the
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
local school district would have to
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for any time that
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
the charter schools met outside the
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
school district calendar yes
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
further question representative woodcock
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone
 
04:12:26.560 --> 04:12:27.349 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone
uh

04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question uh
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes i have a difficulty
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
understanding things
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh taking things out of context but i'm
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
looking at lines basically halfway
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
through seven and through ten have been
 
04:12:40.399 --> 04:12:42.309 align:start position:0%
through seven and through ten have been
bolded

04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
bolded
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
now if i read
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
the topic china public school
 
04:12:46.479 --> 04:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
the topic china public school
transportation

04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
and read those four lines as a separate
 
04:12:49.840 --> 04:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
and read those four lines as a separate
entity

04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
entity
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
that might say to me
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're providing transportation
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
for all china public schools
 
04:12:58.399 --> 04:12:59.429 align:start position:0%
for all china public schools
students

04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
it does not specify the district i know
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
what you're it may appear to refer to
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
up above where you're talking about that
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
specific day when not there but as i
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
read that as a separate entity it says
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
to me all pa all
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
all students
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the child full of school feud on a full
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
day it doesn't say anything about those
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
above those in local town so if you
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
extract that
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
some may believe that this is giving
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
charter public schools full
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
transportation from the public school
 
04:13:28.560 --> 04:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
transportation from the public school
system

04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
could that be interpreted that way
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm going to
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
say no
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is because in i put
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
this bill in to have that section be
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
tacked on
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the existing language that clarifies
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
if it were to be interpreted as you
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
have suggested
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i would have put this bill in and
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
stricken every single thing in that
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
section except the bold language but i
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
didn't i tacked it on to that so
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools uh only can bus within
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know use the buses
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
the resident scenario that i described
 
04:14:09.279 --> 04:14:10.229 align:start position:0%
the resident scenario that i described
earlier

04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
within the resident district that
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
they're located in so i would have to
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
say uh bottom line no to your question
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you for
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
answering my question i'm over here
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
sorry so um let's say it's a large city
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
and there are six charter schools within
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
the city and they're all open on the day
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the public schools have closed for
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
the election
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
there are 15 students that go to those
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
six charter schools
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
the district will be responsible for
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
driving all over the city and picking up
 
04:14:42.080 --> 04:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
driving all over the city and picking up
those

04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:14:42.880 --> 04:14:43.830 align:start position:0%
those
six

04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:14:45.990 --> 04:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
students and sending them to the
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
different charter schools all over or
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
they may need two buses or
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
that would be on the school district who
 
04:14:55.110 --> 04:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
is not having a class that day is that
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
04:14:56.560 --> 04:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
yes

04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:15:03.680 --> 04:15:05.429 align:start position:0%
in the
statute

04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:15:07.510 --> 04:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
that i was discussing earlier
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
chart public chartered school students
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
are in
 
04:15:17.110 --> 04:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
are allowed
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
by law to use the bus system
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
where they are located for the students
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
that reside in that district
 
04:15:25.439 --> 04:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
that reside in that district
so

04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:27.910 --> 04:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
following that
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.110 --> 04:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so is it usual within a
 
04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
district that has many charter schools
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
to just have one bus that picks up the
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
charter school kids and delivers them to
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
the charter schools or do those students
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
go on the regular school buses and get
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
dropped off at the charter school as
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
they go by them
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question all sorts of
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
combinations to make uh busing possible
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the roots and the like
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
i am unaware of any circumstance where a
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
public school bus won you know is
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
designated to pick up all of the
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
charter school students in particular
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
not to say it couldn't happen
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to say
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i've got a a question uh an
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
observation first
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have another situation where we
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
have career technical education centers
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
operate on different days than the
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
regular school is maybe in session
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
student attending that cte
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
to transport themselves to
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
the school the resident school
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then transportation costs from the
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
resident school to the cte center can be
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
made up
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
as an
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
as a component of the tuition and
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
transportation formula we have for
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so i question we have a
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
situation which is very similar here
 
04:16:56.880 --> 04:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
situation which is very similar here
that

04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
the transportation from home to school
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
is not provided on days the school is
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
not in session
 
04:17:07.110 --> 04:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
should this not be the same then for the
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are on a
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
different schedule than the regular
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
school or the resident school
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it sounds as
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
though that scenario would be
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
contradictory to what i'm proposing so
 
04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to say i'll stick with
 
04:17:21.040 --> 04:17:21.910 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to say i'll stick with
the

04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
language i'm proposing okay thank you
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock yes thank you
 
04:17:26.080 --> 04:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock yes thank you
everyone

04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:17:26.880 --> 04:17:27.830 align:start position:0%
everyone
um

04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the towns and one of the towns i
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
represent they have two child schools
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
both of them uh totally different one is
 
04:17:37.269 --> 04:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
primarily an outdoor focused charter
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
school and they're terrific
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
they very rarely have ever heard the
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
term called no school days for snow
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
because they do bunk with their work
 
04:17:46.159 --> 04:17:47.349 align:start position:0%
because they do bunk with their work
outside

04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
outside
 
04:17:49.990 --> 04:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that the days that
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
one child school in my town is closed
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
the public schools are closed but the
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
outdoor charter school is open because
 
04:17:58.389 --> 04:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's a snow day and they focus on other
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
activities we should have the public
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
school buses on a no school day when
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's unsafe to drive
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i had to very
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
carefully follow that scenario
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
if you need no i've got it i think i got
 
04:18:10.239 --> 04:18:11.349 align:start position:0%
if you need no i've got it i think i got
it

04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
inclement weather uh would be closed for
 
04:18:14.080 --> 04:18:17.349 align:start position:0%
inclement weather uh would be closed for
everyone

04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
they don't know what that word means in
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
climate weather they do the bulk of
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
their teaching outside
 
04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
so you're asking if they would still
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
have to be bussed based on this law that
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a local
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
this law would not be applicable sounds
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
like a local uh issue with regards to
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
canceling or not so
 
04:18:42.630 --> 04:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
i would leave it
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
to the local district all right
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
our further questions
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
nazi thank you very much thank you
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.399 --> 04:18:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
bob best
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.990 --> 04:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
again for the opportunity to be here
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'll spare you the reintroduction of who
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
i am since i spoke at the hearing
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning but i've got a lot
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
of involvement in charter schools and i
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a really important
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
one to consider
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think that there's always discussion
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
about costs and some details of
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
coordinating schedules and things like
 
04:20:04.319 --> 04:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
coordinating schedules and things like
that

04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the overriding
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
concern here is
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that children have access to
 
04:20:12.000 --> 04:20:13.269 align:start position:0%
making sure that children have access to
school

04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they have access to school for the
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
whole school calendar all the 180 days
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever the art whatever are the
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
number that are scheduled here
 
04:20:20.880 --> 04:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
number that are scheduled here
and

04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
the existing statute which is reflected
 
04:20:27.110 --> 04:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill that's before you as um
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
plain text
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
i think it was intended to do that and
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
go a long way in that direction which
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
talks about as
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative mooney had offered that
 
04:20:38.239 --> 04:20:39.189 align:start position:0%
representative mooney had offered that
you're

04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you live in the same district as
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
where the school charter school sits
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to ride the buses and
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
then it also talks about using the same
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
routes and terms and conditions and the
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
same routes and schedules that already
 
04:20:52.080 --> 04:20:53.189 align:start position:0%
same routes and schedules that already
exist

04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
exist
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
and i think that the inescapable
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
conclusion of that
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
is that the intended law
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that charter school students are
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
public school students like any other
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to equal treatment
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
they're uh titled uh to parity and
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that means that they're entitled to
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
have a school bus ride to school
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
if they're lawfully or legally entitled
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
um the consequence of this isn't so much
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
about the cost of a bus or two and um
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's typically the number i think one of
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
the bigger charter schools in manchester
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
i think has four buses that provide
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
students over to it
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
but it's uh the cost of a bus while
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
important um isn't as essential as
 
04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that the child gets to
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
school because as we've seen throughout
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
covid when we've had all of these
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
discussions about schools being open and
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
schools being closed when the student
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have access to school
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
they stay home and their parents have to
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
do something
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools are often younger kids
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
some of them are kindergarten and on up
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the one that i'm involved with in
 
04:21:59.520 --> 04:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
the one that i'm involved with in
manchester

04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
begins with sixth grade next year it'll
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
start with fifth grade and those
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
students some of the younger ones are
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
just not able to stay home alone so now
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the parents have to make some
 
04:22:11.670 --> 04:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
arrangement um which they weren't
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily planning on um because
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's a surprise in the school
 
04:22:14.960 --> 04:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
there's a surprise in the school
schedule

04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know pick a percentage of
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
students that ride the bus
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
um the other students who
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
are brought by their parents and are in
 
04:22:26.399 --> 04:22:27.269 align:start position:0%
are brought by their parents and are in
school

04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
are going to continue with their lessons
 
04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that student that isn't doesn't have
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
a ride to school maybe their parents can
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
get them to school maybe they have to
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
stay home and miss school more often
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
they miss school
 
04:22:36.720 --> 04:22:37.670 align:start position:0%
they miss school
um

04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:37.680 --> 04:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
um
they

04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
are obviously disadvantaged
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
by by having that day out of school and
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
those those have to be the top concerns
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
for us those have to be the priorities
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
for us taking care of the kids
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes there is a potential for a little
 
04:22:53.110 --> 04:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
bit of cost it isn't that the charter
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
schools are getting the transportation
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
money and it's not going over to the
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
school district for transportation money
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
because charter schools don't get
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
transportation money that's not part of
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
their formula since they don't provide
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
any transportation
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's also the case that
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
other private schools
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a district separate from charter
 
04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
schools have this same provision where
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
their students are allowed to ride buses
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so we've we as a state we've already
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
sort of decided
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
let's get the kids to school let's not
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
sort of parse are you in the right kind
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
of school are you in the public school
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
are you in a public
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
school but it's a different school
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
because it's a chartered school or it's
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
something else
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
um the overriding priority
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
always has to be let's get the kids to
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
school for all the days of school so
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
that they can participate fully
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the day that where
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
the schedule's misaligned is exam day
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
or is a critical day of education in the
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
in this curriculum that that the
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
school's after
 
04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
um obviously could end up being a big
 
04:23:52.640 --> 04:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
um obviously could end up being a big
problem

04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
election day is one small example
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
professional development days are
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
usually the ones that create the most
 
04:23:59.840 --> 04:24:00.710 align:start position:0%
usually the ones that create the most
uh

04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
disparity because the school district
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
can put those anywhere on the calendar
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
that they want and there's usually four
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
or five professional development days
 
04:24:06.720 --> 04:24:07.429 align:start position:0%
or five professional development days
and

04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
frankly the charter schools are not
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
picking a schedule intentionally to be
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
sideways more often than not the charter
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
schools get a peek at the school
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
district's schedule and they do their
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
best to try to match them up but
 
04:24:19.670 --> 04:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it just there's there's
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
something that misaligns
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
a half a day of schedule instead of a
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
full day or something like that
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
the added cost in the big scheme of
 
04:24:28.159 --> 04:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
the added cost in the big scheme of
things

04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:24:30.000 --> 04:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
things
certainly

04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
it isn't a significant portion of a
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
school district's budget
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you think that they provide
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
transportation to all of their schools
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
for roughly 180 days a year
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
the idea that they'd have to do a couple
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
of buses
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of extra days for one day of
 
04:24:50.790 --> 04:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
year isn't even one percent of their
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
transportation budget much much less
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know percentage of their entire
 
04:24:54.880 --> 04:24:55.750 align:start position:0%
you know percentage of their entire
budget

04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
but it's critical to the students it
 
04:25:00.070 --> 04:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
really makes a difference for them
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.840 --> 04:25:06.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question aren't these the
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
residents in the town where the charter
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
school is aren't they also paying
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
property school property taxes to that
 
04:25:17.439 --> 04:25:18.469 align:start position:0%
property school property taxes to that
town

04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes very much so awesome
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
04:25:22.640 --> 04:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
follow-up

04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're from the town of merrimack would
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
you believe that merrimack provides
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
transportation to the cte center even
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
when they don't have school
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know the details of merrimack
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't be surprised but isn't
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
that our goal let's get the kids to
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
school now cte center schools and i
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard the discussion earlier i don't i
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
honestly know exactly how those work
 
04:25:43.990 --> 04:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm not involved with them but
 
04:25:44.000 --> 04:25:45.189 align:start position:0%
because i'm not involved with them but
um

04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there's some
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
provision for the student to be brought
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
to the school and then from there they
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
can get transportation
 
04:25:53.910 --> 04:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the charter school students are
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
much younger you know they're
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
kindergartners they're first graders
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated to it's very
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
frightening to put a four-year-old or a
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
five-year-old or a six-year-old
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
on a bus and hope that it all works out
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
or they get transportation to one place
 
04:26:06.319 --> 04:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
or they get transportation to one place
and

04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:07.040 --> 04:26:09.750 align:start position:0%
and
are

04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
not taken directly to their own school
 
04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why it makes a lot of
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
difference for them thank you very much
 
04:26:17.110 --> 04:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh further questions representative luno
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
you very much again for being with us um
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
today um you've obviously got a lot of
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
experience with not only the charter
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
schools that you've been with as a as a
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
parent of a
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
student but also as you mentioned this
 
04:26:31.279 --> 04:26:32.229 align:start position:0%
student but also as you mentioned this
morning

04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
your uh representation and work with uh
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
with charter schools all of my kiddos
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
went to the merrimack public schools
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't i don't my kiddos didn't go
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
to church okay i'm sorry i
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstood that
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
i have four but they all went up and um
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
well that's that's not not really where
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
my question is going mike um the the
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
you you had you had mentioned in your
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
testimony just a few moments ago that
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of the charters and i think you said
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
manchester has four buses maybe or
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
something like that that's my
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
understanding um why
 
04:27:07.110 --> 04:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
why i guess why do they have four buses
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and why aren't they using uh
 
04:27:10.000 --> 04:27:11.030 align:start position:0%
um and why aren't they using uh
the

04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
manchester transportation system for um
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um and my answer
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't as clear as it should have been
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
manchester school district provides them
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
with four buses
 
04:27:21.439 --> 04:27:22.309 align:start position:0%
with four buses
that

04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:25.510 --> 04:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that and um
 
04:27:25.520 --> 04:27:26.710 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that and um
and

04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
or it takes four buses to service them
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever you would figure that out
 
04:27:31.040 --> 04:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
or whatever you would figure that out
and

04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and thanks and are they being charged by
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
the um by the manchester school district
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
for transportation services um
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the school days when manchester is
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
in in service no the charter schools not
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
when they're not in service
 
04:27:51.269 --> 04:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
discussions about the cost of it and
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
charging for it i don't know if the bill
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
has actually ever been sent and paid but
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's always sort of this discussion
 
04:28:02.229 --> 04:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
about uh we're going to send you a bill
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
for i don't even know what the number is
 
04:28:05.110 --> 04:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes there's been a discussion about it
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
um and then on the other other hand
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
there's just um questions where uh it's
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
just not available we're not coming you
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%

04:28:24.640 --> 04:28:26.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
questions

04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
questions

04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome baron

04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd thank you for taking my
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
testimony bear christina from the school
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
boards association
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to house bill 1212. uh
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons have been um brought
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
up primarily by representative luna and
 
04:29:11.910 --> 04:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative ladd relative to the
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the cost that would be incurred
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
by local school districts and the um the
 
04:29:17.040 --> 04:29:19.349 align:start position:0%
by local school districts and the um the
transportation

04:29:19.349 --> 04:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
aspect that is embedded in
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy aid formula
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
i would caution this committee or at
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
least remind this committee that the
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
lack of sufficient transportation
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
funds from the state to local school
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
districts is a key component of the
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
conval lawsuit
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you were to pass this bill you would
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
simply be adding more costs that are
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
already insufficiently funded by the
 
04:29:44.469 --> 04:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
state for transportation so you're
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
essentially adding fuel to the fire and
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
um you would be um
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
you'd be making conval's case that that
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
state funding um as embedded in the
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid formula is not sufficient
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
for all the other obligations relative
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
to transportation that the legislature
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
is imposed on local school districts
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
the second aspect that nhsba has for
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill is by adding
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
new requirements for a school district
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
to provide transportation on students
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
forced for charter school students on
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
days that the public school the
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
traditional public school is not
 
04:30:18.720 --> 04:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
traditional public school is not
operational

04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
operational
 
04:30:22.950 --> 04:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
may interfere with contracts that we
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
already have whether or not that is a
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
contract with a private transportation
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
provider or perhaps and i believe in
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
some cities
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing i don't know per se but
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
some of our transportation providers may
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
be operating under collective bargaining
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
agreements with their pertinent cities
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
so these may have days and vacations and
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
things of that nature embedded into
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever contract we're operating under
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
on whether it's a contract with a
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
private vendor or a contract such as a
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and last everybody on this committee
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
knows that statewide there's a
 
04:30:57.750 --> 04:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
significant bus driver shortage
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
we have had to get we meaning public
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
schools have had to get significantly
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
creative the last number of years and
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
providing bonuses and providing training
 
04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
and providing um
 
04:31:07.120 --> 04:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
and providing um
uh

04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
other bonus incentives to get more
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
people to become bus drivers we don't
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
have enough bus drivers for the routes
 
04:31:16.229 --> 04:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
that we're currently running if we're
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
currently being obligated to run routes
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
on days when the public school is not
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
open for either an election day or for
 
04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
inclement weather or if a charter school
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
was doing some sort of curricular
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
component on a saturday um i don't know
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
where we're going to find those people
 
04:31:32.469 --> 04:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough people to meet our
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
current obligations by adding more
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
obligations um it's going to be uh
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're just adding to the stress
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
level um both from a workforce
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint um and as well as the fiscal
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
aspects that the local public school
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
would be incurring that we would not be
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed for so for those uh
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
three general reasons uh nhsba opposes
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:31:53.040 --> 04:31:55.030 align:start position:0%
house bill
1212.

04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
1212.
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative tanner
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:31:59.040 --> 04:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
at least at my school
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
more headache type jobs was that of kind
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
oversight person for the school buses uh
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
school bus director who uh ran kind of
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
the dispatch kind of the
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
karen you know for the school bus
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
transportation coordinator yeah yeah and
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
took all the headache calls back and
 
04:32:20.560 --> 04:32:22.149 align:start position:0%
took all the headache calls back and
forth

04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
do all schools have that um and if they
 
04:32:24.880 --> 04:32:26.229 align:start position:0%
do all schools have that um and if they
do

04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
that person wouldn't work on certain
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
days and so that cost has to be added in
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh do all school
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
districts have a transportation
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
coordinator i don't know that's a good
 
04:32:38.800 --> 04:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
coordinator i don't know that's a good
question

04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to presume not i would presume
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
in some of our smaller k through 3 k
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
through 4 districts that's probably left
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the responsibility of the principal
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
or the superintendent that's a
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
presumption on my end so the simple
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
04:32:56.080 --> 04:32:57.110 align:start position:0%

uh do you ever have the copy of the bill
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
in front of you i do yes i'd like to ask

you the same question i asked
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative moody and see if we have
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
the same answer one representative's
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
answer i want a legal answer
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
i'm reading 7 through 12 and i'm
 
04:33:17.039 --> 04:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
i'm reading 7 through 12 and i'm
wondering

04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
if a public school is closed for a snow
 
04:33:21.840 --> 04:33:22.869 align:start position:0%
if a public school is closed for a snow
day

04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the charter school is not closed for
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
a snow day
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
are our
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
public school buses that are off the
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
road because of safety now required to
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
go on the road and provide
 
04:33:33.680 --> 04:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
go on the road and provide
transportation

04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative as i'm reading i believe
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's line 9 through 11. if the district
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a full day or half day of
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
school scheduled on the day of the
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
charter school oh i'm sorry
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
transportation shall be provided to
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
charter public schools on all the full
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
days and half days the charter school
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
requires attendance i'm reading the bill
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it says if the district doesn't have
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
a full day or half day of school then
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
the charter school cannot be charged
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
the charter school cannot be charged
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
implies that we're still obligated to
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
provide those transportation services
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
when the public school is not open for
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the public school is not
 
04:34:12.080 --> 04:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the public school is not
open

04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of the bill is that if
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
the public school is closed for whatever
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
reason elections inclement weather
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be but the charter
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
school is open that the public school is
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
still required to provide transportation
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
services that's how nhsba is
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
interpreting the bill thank you thank
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
you everyone
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah just looking at that um i notice it
 
04:34:37.520 --> 04:34:38.470 align:start position:0%
yeah just looking at that um i notice it
says

04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
full day or half a day of school
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled and if it was a snow day it
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
would have still been scheduled right it
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
would have just been cancelled
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative that's that's certainly
 
04:34:54.150 --> 04:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
an interesting interpretation that one
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'd suggest you speak with the sponsor
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the buildo to ascertain intent though
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
relative to a distinction between
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
scheduled or cancelled
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i'm a
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
novice here so if i ask a question that
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
everyone knows the answer to please
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
forgive me
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
but when we were discussing efa kinds of
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
things i learned
 
04:35:22.879 --> 04:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
things i learned
that

04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
report for people who are report for
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
attendance on students who are following
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
other routes
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if in this case
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
they also report for attendance hence
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
they are able to receive federal funding
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera it's not
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
out of that part of thing but it is
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're still funded for those students
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
even though they're over here
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:35:51.670 --> 04:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative i i may need some
 
04:35:51.680 --> 04:35:53.109 align:start position:0%
representative i i may need some
clarification

04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:35:53.119 --> 04:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
clarification
so

04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
the public school is tracking
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
students who ride the bus or are
 
04:36:02.629 --> 04:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
eligible to ride the bus i i apologize
 
04:36:02.639 --> 04:36:06.629 align:start position:0%
eligible to ride the bus i i apologize
representative

04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
if we have a principle that
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you draw if you report this student
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
for attendance which they do and then
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
receive funding for that
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
then why if they need some additional
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
assistance in getting to school would
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
that be an issue
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i think
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
i understand well the issue would be
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
that you would be running
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
buses and paying for gasoline and paying
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
for bus drivers that you one had not
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
necessarily budgeted for
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
two may run afoul of contracts as i
 
04:36:38.799 --> 04:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
two may run afoul of contracts as i
mentioned

04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
and three i to my understanding those
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
charter school children that are riding
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
the buses provided by the public schools
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
are not the the public school district
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
is not receiving any funding for those
 
04:36:54.160 --> 04:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
is not receiving any funding for those
students

04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding was they are receiving
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
funding not for that purpose but they're
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
receiving funding
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
the local public school districts
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
traditional public school district my
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
understanding if i'm mistaken
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative ladder representative
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
luna perhaps you can you can correct me
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if a true i'm
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
going to call it a traditional public
 
04:37:16.709 --> 04:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
school because i fully understand and
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that charter schools are
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
public schools for the just for that
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
distinction my understanding is that if
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
a chartered if a public school district
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
is providing transportation to students
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
who are attending chartered public
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
schools the local public school district
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
is not receiving funding for that
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
for that for for the purpose of
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
providing transportation to charter
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
children i understand that but they are
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
receiving funds because of that
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
registration that they report
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the state yes the the
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
if i if
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
sorry by all means representative um
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
the only place we have direct
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
transportation reimbursement by way of
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
formula is career technical education
 
04:37:59.189 --> 04:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
we reimburse at 25 cents a mile per
 
04:37:59.199 --> 04:38:00.949 align:start position:0%
we reimburse at 25 cents a mile per
student

04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we budget approximately 680 000
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
for that purpose the actual cost of
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
districts is closer to 2.7 million
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
dollars so we're not fully funding that
 
04:38:14.070 --> 04:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the area we're talking
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
about here in the regular public school
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
the funding for transportation is built
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
into base adequate the base cost
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's no transportation formula where
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
you get x number dollars school district
 
04:38:31.750 --> 04:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's built in that 3 456 dollars now 3
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
700 something
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
and it's there
 
04:38:34.561 --> 04:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
and it's there
now

04:38:35.349 --> 04:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
if the other school also receives costs
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
like that or
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
funding revenue and it's built into
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
their base that they're receiving also
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
that transportation
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
cost per student which is approximately
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
well 350 times cost of living now it's a
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
so it could be as high as you know 400
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
450 dollars
 
04:39:00.070 --> 04:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
on a per people basis for the year
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the only source of
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
transportation revenue the districts
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
receive on this
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a money-making affair and
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's the issue we have buses running
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
now with one-third capacity
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
on a 66 passenger bus for elementary
 
04:39:15.920 --> 04:39:17.590 align:start position:0%
on a 66 passenger bus for elementary
kids

04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's not paying labor it's not paying
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
insurance it's not paying you know
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
replacement car any of that stuff
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
so i think that's how we're working
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
representative ford i'm going to read
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
from the convail lawsuit
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
the current state funding
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
current state funding incorporates a
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
base universal transportation cost of
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
three hundred and fifteen dollars three
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
one five three hundred and fifteen
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil so the state is part
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
of your adequacy the thirty seven thirty
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
eight hundred hours after
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
that public schools get per child 315 of
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is to provide for transportation
 
04:39:53.360 --> 04:39:55.430 align:start position:0%
that is to provide for transportation
services

04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
next paragraph from the convail lawsuit
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
there is not a single district in the
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
state with 10 or more pupils whose
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
transportation costs are less than 400
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
hours per pupil so the argument is that
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
districts are being
 
04:40:08.480 --> 04:40:09.670 align:start position:0%
districts are being
expending

04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
expending
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
more than 400 hours per student to
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
provide transportation services just for
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
the traditional public school children
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're only getting reimbursed 300 no
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're not even reimbursed we're only
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
being getting revenues of 315 dollars
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
per student and now we're being asked to
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
add additional students on different
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
days that we have not budgeted for and
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're not getting any adequacy for
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
the other aspect to that if i may i
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on going down this route
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh your annual meetings are in um
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
another six or seven weeks um so our
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
budgets are pretty much set budget
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
hearings were within the last two weeks
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
budgets are going to be set in another
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the middle of march um so
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
if if we're adding costs through this
 
04:40:52.878 --> 04:40:54.310 align:start position:0%
if if we're adding costs through this
bill

04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know i don't it's
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
local property taxes are going to go up
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
next october because we're gonna have to
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
pay for more stuff without getting any
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of uh
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
bear christina from the school boards
 
04:41:09.040 --> 04:41:11.190 align:start position:0%
bear christina from the school boards
association

04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
everybody good
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you mr
 
04:41:14.798 --> 04:41:15.910 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you mr
chairman

04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
on a snow day
 
04:41:20.000 --> 04:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
on a snow day
okay

04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
are they made up automatically
 
04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
in other words if you take a snow day
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
you have to make one up at the end
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for the question
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative no um the law requires we
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
had a little conversation i forget if
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
you were here or not representative um
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
when chairman kline from the state board
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
of education spoke about i forget the
 
04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill number when we were talking about
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
the remote instruction versus in-person
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
instruction um the law requires that
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
school districts when they're building
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
their calendar
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
build in 60 additional hours for
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
inclement weather so one snow day no you
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to make that up at the end of
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the year
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
once you start getting into seven eight
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
ten school day snow days you would have
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
to tack on
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
days at the end of the school year thank
 
04:42:03.680 --> 04:42:05.270 align:start position:0%
days at the end of the school year thank
you

04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh next and last person i have a
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and committee
 
04:42:28.080 --> 04:42:29.190 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and committee
members

04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief i think we've covered a
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think the purpose of this bill is to
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the kids are getting to
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
school that's really in a nutshell we're
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
now talking about a lot of days we're
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the rare instance where
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
schedules may not align for whatever
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
reason but we're trying to get the kids
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
to school the kids that we're talking
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
about for the most part are probably k
 
04:42:58.350 --> 04:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
through 8 9th and 10th graders perhaps
 
04:42:58.360 --> 04:42:59.590 align:start position:0%
through 8 9th and 10th graders perhaps
[Music]

04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
some of the districts may not allow the
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
kids to ride the public transit even in
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where that lands right now
 
04:43:06.798 --> 04:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where that lands right now
but

04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing a lot of people talk about
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money it's a lot of
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
money it's a lot of money and it is
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
money is important people who know me
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
will say i'm cheap i mean i'm pretty
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
tight with my cash and we run our
 
04:43:21.190 --> 04:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
charter schools pretty tight
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day we're talking
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
a couple dollars per child
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
per day
 
04:43:27.680 --> 04:43:28.708 align:start position:0%
per day
and

04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about maybe a day one trip
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
or two trips
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
the kids that are going to be impacted
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
are the kids that need to be in school
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
their parents are working they don't
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
have transportation maybe to bring the
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
kids to school we need to rely on the
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
buses and it's not for a lot of days
 
04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
other issues and we're hearing contracts
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining etc those are
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
important but they'll get worked out
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
when this is resolved again we're
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
talking about one or two three trips out
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
of an entire school year
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
i certainly would never expect the
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
district to bus children if there's bad
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
weather i just wouldn't expect that i
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to put bus drivers at risk
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want kids on the buses if
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's that bad so i'm not sure that was
 
04:44:14.948 --> 04:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
ever intended to be that way
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of it i think we can work out
 
04:44:17.280 --> 04:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
the rest of it i think we can work out
um

04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot of money i think it's
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
more important that we're getting our
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
kids to school safely making sure the
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
kids that don't have transportation if
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's not a bus or getting to school
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then they're able to get home
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
 
04:44:32.878 --> 04:44:34.868 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
questions

04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
being familiar with a
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
charter school and how it runs is there
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
an attempt on the part of charter
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
schools to try to align calendars so
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're agreeing with the
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
the district calendar for example
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
starting at a certain time either prior
 
04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
to labor day or after labor day that's
 
04:44:56.708 --> 04:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
been contentious throughout the state
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then of course you have the other
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
days within for professional
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
days in service days
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
so is there an attempt to try to align
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
these calendars so they are on the same
 
04:45:08.080 --> 04:45:09.430 align:start position:0%
these calendars so they are on the same
scheduling

04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for every charter school
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i can speak for the school leaders
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
that i've interacted with which is quite
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
a few and we all try to work with our
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
districts we call and ask you know this
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
is when we're looking to start this is
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
when we're looking to end our day
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking to get a copy of their
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
calendar so we can build our calendar as
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
closely as possible to it
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to collaborate with the
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
districts it's just once in a while
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's an off day whether it's exam
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
week or something comes up sometimes
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's just something's missed
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and but we want to make sure every child
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to be in the school
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
when it's open thank you very much
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative porter i see your hands
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you mr chair and
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you as i'm sitting here thinking
 
04:45:52.560 --> 04:45:53.670 align:start position:0%
thank you as i'm sitting here thinking
um

04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
there are different models of education
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
some schools
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have six weeks on three weeks off
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing a different calendar
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
form of calendar if one of our charter
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
schools was to decide that one of the
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
ways they wanted to innovate was to play
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
around with the traditional school
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
calendar and like go through the summer
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
and have longer breaks at one time and
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
shorter breaks at other times if they if
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
they did that and that was part of their
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
contract or their application
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
would then if and say they were open two
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
weeks when the schools were closed
 
04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
or they were closed three weeks when the
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
schools were open would they be would
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
the public schools then be responsible
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
for transporting those students during i
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not trying to be difficult here
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to think of
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that might happen in the
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
future very i mean my ideal school was
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
open all year long and having blocks of
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
time that were different than the
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
traditional i thought that might be
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the learning of kids
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
especially over the summer etc so if
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
someone came forward with that
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
would passing this bill
 
04:46:56.550 --> 04:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
then require
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
the public schools to transport the
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
students when they were not even open at
 
04:47:01.200 --> 04:47:02.788 align:start position:0%
students when they were not even open at
all

04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
for long periods
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
would venture a guess that yes but that
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't the intention the intention is to
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
operate within the normal
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
school calendar year and try to cover
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
those days that are missing
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
so not looking to transport children
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
question um you said about
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
you concentrated on working it out with
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
the with its districts as far as
 
04:47:40.628 --> 04:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
calendar issues were concerned have you
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
tried to work it out as far as the
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
amount of money the
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
extra days would cost
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
to for uh transportation or
 
04:47:50.550 --> 04:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
or any
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
anything on that line
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
we've received the cost per bus per trip
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
from one of the districts that we have a
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
school in
 
04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:01.350 align:start position:0%
school in
um

04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work it out with them
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we try to align our calendars
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
as best we can
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
again most of these days are just
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's an off day whether it's exams or
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's something going on that the
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
school is participating and on the other
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
side of it i know some schools have
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
longer days more days off and the school
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
districts don't have to transport them
 
04:48:23.200 --> 04:48:23.990 align:start position:0%
districts don't have to transport them
for

04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the week of thanksgiving at
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
all or they have a longer holiday break
 
04:48:29.830 --> 04:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
they have different days off where the
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
school districts do not have to
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
transport and we work very hard to make
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
sure that they have access to those
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
calendars and are aware of that at the
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year right
 
04:48:42.070 --> 04:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
just as a follow up on that my question
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
was not about the calendar because i
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
you've made it quite clear how
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
you tried to work it out with them on
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
calendar what i'm asking is have you
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
tried to work it out with them
 
04:48:51.520 --> 04:48:52.868 align:start position:0%
tried to work it out with them
financially

04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
financially
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
on how much it costs this district to
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
provide that extra busing and and how
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
much they're charging you in other words
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
to come to some agreement that way
 
04:49:01.840 --> 04:49:03.270 align:start position:0%
to come to some agreement that way
financially

04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
financially
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for every school i can
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
only speak for the ones that i've been
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
involved with and we've had discussions
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
about the cost and i could be wrong but
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
my recollection this was about three or
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
four years ago my recollection is that
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
they have a set fee for their buses per
 
04:49:17.520 --> 04:49:18.948 align:start position:0%
they have a set fee for their buses per
day

04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:49:21.430 --> 04:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
to use it
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
yes so uh could you give me an idea what
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
that fee was
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
i want to say it was roughly
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
for some reason 238 dollars one way is
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
what's sticking in my head per bus
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i could be wrong and that's going
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
back probably four years now i'm sure
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's escalated with gas and everything
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
else but um
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
it you know it was significant enough
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
we were looking one day one of the
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
schools actually had more buses
 
04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we were looking at closer to
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars for the day charged
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
to the charter school and it was
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
for exam week or something for one of
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
the days
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much have a good
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon you too
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we have any more cards
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
on that particular bill so we're closing
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
and preparing to go into the next
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
represent moody mooney you're welcome
 
04:50:34.878 --> 04:50:40.708 align:start position:0%
represent moody mooney you're welcome

okay
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%

i provided written testimony for all of
 
04:51:13.760 --> 04:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
i provided written testimony for all of
you

04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that's being distributed now i begin
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
it with
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
the background and the scenario that i
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
did for the previous build just now so i
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't think i have to repeat that
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me as though it's clear as
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
to how it works in terms of busing so
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go right into it

a terminal

is another location
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
where students congregate or are dropped
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
off to essentially catch connecting
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
buses to their final destination
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
i would provide the example of when
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're flying
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
and you have a flight ultimately to la
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
but you have a connecting flight you
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
have to catch
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
in chicago
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
with bussing
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
a student may be bust
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
at a location oftentimes another school
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%

transportation companies
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
they do an extraordinary job
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
and i've worked with them
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
in manchester i'm familiar with the bus
 
04:53:32.550 --> 04:53:32.560 align:start position:0%

04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%

04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
never met a more organized professional

group in my
life

04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
they do a great job
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i know that they're doing the best
 
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they can with roots and the like
 
04:53:46.240 --> 04:53:47.510 align:start position:0%
that they can with roots and the like
however

04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
we are asking
 
04:53:49.840 --> 04:53:50.628 align:start position:0%
we are asking
if

04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
depots and terminals are not used
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
for public school districts
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
then they not be used for the chartered
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
school students that are within those
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
districts as well
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
that will conclude my testimony thank
 
04:54:08.550 --> 04:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you very much are
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
there questions
 
04:54:10.878 --> 04:54:12.708 align:start position:0%
there questions
representation

04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
private schools also have the same
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
requirement but when our private school
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
in town
 
04:54:23.040 --> 04:54:23.910 align:start position:0%
in town
had

04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:54:23.920 --> 04:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
had
students

04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
on the public system going to the school
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
they were all met at the middle school
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
and then driven
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
to the private school
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
um this would not allow that
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
so you're saying could i um thank you
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the question i just want to clarify
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
you're saying in your scenario that both
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
private school and public school
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
students in that district were brought
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
to a location no just a private school
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
student okay
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
they were all met at the middle school
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then a bus took to the private
 
04:54:58.480 --> 04:54:59.830 align:start position:0%
and then a bus took to the private
school

04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
public school and private school
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
students all met at the middle school no
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
just private well all the students that
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
went to the middle school all met the
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
middle school but then the students that
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
went to the private school also came to
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
the middle school and then they were bus
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the private school understood my bill
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
is related only to students of a
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
chartered public school
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
but that would be the same instance
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
where that would not be allowed sounds
 
04:55:28.150 --> 04:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
very similar yes i you're bringing in
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
private schools which is a whole
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
thing yeah the private schools stop the
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
transportation because the hours
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't die understood but just to
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
clarify my bill
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
public chartered school students
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
following on
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the previous one because we do that
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
in hudson
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
and they go to the elementary school and
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
they are supervised by teachers and
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
gotten into they have little lines and
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
they get them into the lines before the
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
buses show up and it's it's i think it's
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
more than a bus
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
because we have a pretty big private
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
school and they've been doing that
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
i've lived there 38 years and it it's
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
been going on all this time
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
why would it be inappropriate
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
for a charter school system to use that
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
same system that's been working for the
 
04:56:18.958 --> 04:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
same system that's been working for the
local

04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
why would it be inappropriate to work
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
for a charter school when it's been
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
working for the local
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
private school for all these years
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
without a problem
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
um i know that those who are going to
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
testify are closer to this issue at this
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
point than i am however when i was
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
involved in this um and had been exposed
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
to it
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
not every school
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's designated as a depot as a
 
04:56:47.520 --> 04:56:48.788 align:start position:0%
that's designated as a depot as a
terminal

04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
terminal
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
is as a ready
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps well staffed or coordinated as
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
the one you just described
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
it could sometimes
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
be a safety issue it could also be a
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
delay in transporting the students and
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
so forth so it sounds like in that
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
scenario it may work
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
would it not then make sense to instead
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
of forbidding it
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
putting some guidelines on it that says
 
04:57:27.910 --> 04:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
they have to be supervised by school
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
your personnel or something instead of
 
04:57:32.550 --> 04:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
just saying you can't do it when it's
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
something that is working for some towns
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
very good question i appreciate it
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with that i would be open to
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
that but i hesitate
 
04:57:45.270 --> 04:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
because yet again another layer of rules
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
and regulations
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh on bearing on the backs of our
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
administrators and our teachers to now
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
come up with a new set of rules because
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
they have students coming in and being
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
dropped off at depots and there's a
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
period of time where they have to be
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
supervised so i'm torn on that
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
open to it but torn on it knowing the
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
realities of
 
04:58:06.550 --> 04:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
when rules and regulations come bearing
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
down from concord on our administrators
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
and our teachers
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question thank you so
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
i i have a
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up to where we are with this
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
conversation and questioning the issue
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
of supervision
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have a responsibility
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
all all educators have responsibility
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that these
 
04:58:26.000 --> 04:58:27.190 align:start position:0%
make sure that these
students

04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
all my youngsters are under proper
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
supervision and you come in from home to
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
school a where the
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
the transfer is made
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
you might have several buses coming in
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
from different directions so you could
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
end up with a number of kids there
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
on the days that no teachers are there
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes it's of teachers on the
 
04:58:46.320 --> 04:58:47.430 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes it's of teachers on the
playground

04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
playground
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
which are supervising other students
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to that resident school right
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
there who also supervise these students
 
04:58:55.830 --> 04:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
which are going to go on whether to a
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
middle school or to a charter school and
 
04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's common
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh what will we do on those days when
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's nobody there to do the
 
04:59:03.760 --> 04:59:05.190 align:start position:0%
there's nobody there to do the
supervision

04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
04:59:05.200 --> 04:59:06.070 align:start position:0%
supervision
and

04:59:06.070 --> 04:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
that bus drive the bus drivers couldn't
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
leave unless there's an adult they're
 
04:59:09.360 --> 04:59:11.030 align:start position:0%
leave unless there's an adult they're
supervising

04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
supervising
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
a house is going to work
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
with the supervision that's needed
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the students which are being dropped
 
04:59:20.550 --> 04:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
off at that transfer site and waiting
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
for the students come in from another
 
04:59:22.160 --> 04:59:23.030 align:start position:0%
for the students come in from another
site

04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
site
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
and then all those students get on to go
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
to the charter school thank you for that
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
question i can only think my bill would
 
04:59:30.788 --> 04:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
help in that scenario in that it would
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh of now forbid this kind of uh
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
hypothetical as you describe where we're
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
having more terminals and depots my bid
 
04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
04:59:48.240 --> 04:59:49.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
mullen

04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:59:53.920 --> 04:59:55.110 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
so

04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh i'm trying to wrap my head around the
 
04:59:58.240 --> 05:00:00.070 align:start position:0%
uh i'm trying to wrap my head around the
logistics

05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
logistics
 
05:00:00.080 --> 05:00:01.430 align:start position:0%
logistics
um

05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm your neighbor in bedford our town is
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
we've got six kids or seven kids going
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
to a charter and they're coming from all
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
different directions
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we can't
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
intersect anywhere or uh for them to get
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
off of one bus and get on to another bus
 
05:00:25.280 --> 05:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
off of one bus and get on to another bus
so

05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
do you foresee this as
 
05:00:32.830 --> 05:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
a a dedicated bus for those children
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm the kids in our community get on the
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
bus at home and get off the bus at
 
05:00:38.718 --> 05:00:40.788 align:start position:0%
bus at home and get off the bus at
school

05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
but they're routed and they're all going
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
to the same place can you
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
take me on a ride
 
05:00:49.040 --> 05:00:49.990 align:start position:0%
take me on a ride
from

05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
your house where you're leaving as the
 
05:00:56.550 --> 05:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
chartered school student and
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
not having to get off the bus
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that
 
05:01:02.400 --> 05:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that
um

05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:04.080 --> 05:01:06.708 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
if i live in manchester
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm a student
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i attend a
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
chartered public school in manchester i
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
am entitled to ride the manchester
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
school bus to go to school
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
there may be a scenario where i am
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
picked up at my home
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
and driven to
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
another school
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
i have to wait
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
the bus i was just on takes off
 
05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
i wait for now another bus to arrive
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
i board it and it would then take me to
 
05:01:48.550 --> 05:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
my charter public school
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
the place i just was could be another
 
05:01:50.718 --> 05:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
the place i just was could be another
school

05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
for coveted precautions i believe there
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
was a large depot in manchester that was
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
not a school but a facility that could
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
certainly uh be a terminal and so forth
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be uh the scenario
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
um what we're saying in the bill is
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
again if if manchester isn't doing that
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a route
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
then it shouldn't for their public
 
05:02:16.240 --> 05:02:17.670 align:start position:0%
then it shouldn't for their public
schools

05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
then it shouldn't be done for me the
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
manchester chartered public student
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
to have to make that
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
terminal stop before i get to my final
 
05:02:27.520 --> 05:02:30.788 align:start position:0%
terminal stop before i get to my final
destination

05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.798 --> 05:02:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
except that the other
 
05:02:34.878 --> 05:02:36.708 align:start position:0%
except that the other
students

05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
are getting on the bus
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
as a group
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
along a route and all going to the same
 
05:02:43.600 --> 05:02:45.030 align:start position:0%
along a route and all going to the same
place

05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to get off because
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
that bus is picking them up and taking
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
them all to the same place
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
i now live amongst those kids but i'm
 
05:02:55.520 --> 05:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
i now live amongst those kids but i'm
going

05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
halfway there and then i need to go in a
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
different direction
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
is there i mean i can't see any other
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
option other than having you know a
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
dedicated driver pick that one student
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
up for
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
the four students that it applies to
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
however many um
 
05:03:17.360 --> 05:03:20.230 align:start position:0%
however many um
how

05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
how are they going to get from their
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
home to the charter school without
 
05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
having to stop somewhere
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly a bus
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
could pick up
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
students from multiple schools
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
and make stops along the way direct
 
05:03:35.760 --> 05:03:37.510 align:start position:0%
and make stops along the way direct
stops

05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
stops
 
05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
but they can't have a terminal
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
connecting flight for lack of a better
 
05:03:41.520 --> 05:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
connecting flight for lack of a better
word

05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm not
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
saying in my bill you know a designated
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
bus to go to you know this school and
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
another to go to just to that school
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
another to go to this school
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
i'm saying bus companies can come up
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
with routes to collect everybody that's
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to a different school and making
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
stops then at all the schools of the
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
people i've just picked up
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
without any connecting stops
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
so when i let you off as the bus driver
 
05:04:11.280 --> 05:04:12.070 align:start position:0%
so when i let you off as the bus driver
it's

05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
my bill would say it's going to be to
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
your final destination
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be to a a median
 
05:04:20.240 --> 05:04:22.708 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be to a a median
destination

05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
destination
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
could i just have one quick go ahead
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
in our community we have uh
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
rules about how long students can stay
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
on a bus
 
05:04:33.200 --> 05:04:35.110 align:start position:0%
on a bus
so

05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
i believe it's their the goal is to have
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
the little ones on the bus less than an
 
05:04:40.878 --> 05:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
the little ones on the bus less than an
hour

05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
hour
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to how long
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
it might take if there were
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
15 kids scattered all over manchester
 
05:04:55.030 --> 05:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
that somebody had to be the first kid
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
picked up and somebody's going to be the
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
last have you given any thought to that
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
i have not in consideration of this bill
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
um and i'll tell you why i'm trying to
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
as best as possible
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
but succeeding the goal of what this
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
bill intends to do
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
allow as much flexibility as possible
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
within reason
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
of those who so diligently put these
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
question i live up in sullivan county
 
05:05:33.520 --> 05:05:34.868 align:start position:0%
question i live up in sullivan county
and

05:05:34.868 --> 05:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:34.878 --> 05:05:35.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
the two districts that are really close
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
together where i live uh or where i go
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
by as i
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
travel down here or sunapee and
 
05:05:44.718 --> 05:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
travel down here or sunapee and
kearsarge

05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
kearsarge
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a stop
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
um along one of the lakes
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
where the every morning when i come
 
05:05:54.550 --> 05:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
early for these committee meetings
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
there's a kearsarge bus
 
05:05:56.958 --> 05:05:57.830 align:start position:0%
there's a kearsarge bus
waiting

05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
05:06:00.150 --> 05:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
for a sunapee bus
 
05:06:02.550 --> 05:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that they can transfer students
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
because in the in the back country of
 
05:06:06.788 --> 05:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
the roads
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't they aren't like the streets in
 
05:06:10.320 --> 05:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
don't they aren't like the streets in
manchester

05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
and the school district uh kearsarge has
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
eight towns and it's one of the largest
 
05:06:16.798 --> 05:06:18.708 align:start position:0%
eight towns and it's one of the largest
geographical

05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
geographical
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
school districts in new hampshire
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they have the probably the heaviest
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
transportation budget
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
and in order to make it efficient and
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
they've contracted with nearby districts
 
05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
these roads that kind of naturally lead
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
to each other to have these areas where
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
they meet
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
this bill that you have offered here
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
would mess up their system tremendously
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
depending on where the charter schools
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
were and
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if you thought at all
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
about how this is going to affect the
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
rural areas of new hampshire
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question in the
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
scenario you provided
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
was there a chartered school
 
05:07:06.718 --> 05:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
was there a chartered school
involved

05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that there's a
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
charter school there's there's a couple
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
of private schools in our area and
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
those students uh although they you know
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's this bus switch between
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
districts at a certain location where
 
05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
certain students go back and forth but
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
then they're transported to their
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
individual schools whether it's an
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
elementary slash middle school
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
and then from there
 
05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
if there's further transportation then
 
05:07:38.550 --> 05:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
the then the bus
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
another bus or that bus depending on how
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know they work it would go to the
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
private school or the
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
assuming the charter school which it
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
seems like you're saying that's not
 
05:07:52.230 --> 05:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's not acceptable
 
05:07:54.150 --> 05:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
i would thank you for that clarification
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
and question beforehand
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
i would argue
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
that my bill does not apply to the
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
scenario you described
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
because of the big if
 
05:08:06.160 --> 05:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
because of the big if
word

05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bill says
 
05:08:09.760 --> 05:08:11.910 align:start position:0%
the bill says
if

05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
the school district where the charter
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
school is located isn't doing it
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
you can't do it for the chartered school
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
students either
 
05:08:24.150 --> 05:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
but in your scenario it sounds to me
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
like the school districts are doing it
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
so therefore it would continue to be
 
05:08:31.440 --> 05:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
so therefore it would continue to be
allowed

05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
05:08:33.840 --> 05:08:34.868 align:start position:0%
allowed
yes

05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:08:34.878 --> 05:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
yes
um

05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:36.000 --> 05:08:36.868 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know as it's that much different
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
than representative mullen's
 
05:08:40.638 --> 05:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
than representative mullen's
uh

05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:41.440 --> 05:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh
idea

05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
what it seems to me that you're saying
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
and just
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is like
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
do you are you trying to say that
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
even in our rural areas
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's a charter school
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
within that rural area at some point
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
kid a who's a charter school student
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
gets on bus one
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
and that same bus one whether it's from
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
kearsarge sunopee or whatever
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
has to end up at that charter school
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
without any
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
any connection anywhere
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
because that's what it seems to me like
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
05:09:26.550 --> 05:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.590 --> 05:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
is to the chartered school
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:34.080 --> 05:09:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
that's

05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay even if part of that depot is the
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
buses sitting
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
and the kid has to change from a
 
05:09:47.350 --> 05:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
kearsarge bus to a sunopee bus because
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
the the roads and the towns inter
 
05:09:49.760 --> 05:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
the the roads and the towns inter
intersect

05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
and in that scenario
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds and thank you for that in that
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
scenario it sounds as though because
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
your school district is
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
is doing that sort of exchange
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
they could continue doing so
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
but the charter school student wouldn't
 
05:10:14.550 --> 05:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
get on bus one and end up at charter
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
school on bus one and that seems like
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.638 --> 05:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
a transfer of bus
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
would not i mean necessarily be a depot
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
or a terminal
 
05:10:28.000 --> 05:10:28.788 align:start position:0%
or a terminal
um

05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
being dropped off and waiting for a
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i want to just further add yes i
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
have considered um charter schools
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
collectively throughout the state
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
when sponsoring this piece of
 
05:10:45.120 --> 05:10:46.868 align:start position:0%
when sponsoring this piece of
legislation

05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.400 --> 05:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
if a school some of our school districts
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
single town school districts are very
 
05:11:06.310 --> 05:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
geographically large
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and so in order to keep kids from being
 
05:11:10.470 --> 05:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
on a bus
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
for hours we run a lot of buses right to
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
pick from all over the place and bring
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
into the school
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
but if you have a charter school
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
and you can't let it let that student
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
ride the bus from their neighborhood
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
the same bus that all the other kids are
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking to the school and then have the
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
school collect up all of them to take to
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
the charter school what you're going to
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
have to do is either run a whole bunch
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
of empty buses
 
05:11:42.628 --> 05:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
or you're going to have to run one bus
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
say you've only got 15 kids or even if
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
you have 20 one bus all over the entire
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
school district at all those desperate
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
pla disparate places
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that could take hours to do that to
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
pick up all those kids
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not sure why you would
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
prefer that to having them meet at
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
another school and take a single bus
 
05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
charter school thank you for the
 
05:12:11.590 --> 05:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
question i would just go back to that
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
word if if the school district where the
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
chartered school is located
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
does transportation precisely like you
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
just described
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
then it's fine for the chartered public
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
school as well
 
05:12:26.230 --> 05:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
but the chartered public school student
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
should not be in a situation where they
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
are brought to terminals
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
and depots
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the public school students where the
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
school is located is not
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
but that was not my question
 
05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
my question was the pro the traditional
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
all the kids go end up at the school
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
that they're going to they don't
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
transfer them but a charter school would
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
either have to transfer them there or
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
would have to run a bus over the entire
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
district to pick up all those charter
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
school kids from one end to the other
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
to do it straight
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering why you would prefer
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
kids stay on the bus for a couple hours
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
potentially i know how long it takes
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
in my just in my town
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
if i was to run in and out of all those
 
05:13:18.400 --> 05:13:20.230 align:start position:0%
if i was to run in and out of all those
neighborhoods

05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
why you would prefer that
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
to having them meet at a public school
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
where they can be bussed to the charter
 
05:13:28.798 --> 05:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
where they can be bussed to the charter
school

05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:13:29.760 --> 05:13:30.868 align:start position:0%
school
because

05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
if my town does you know if everybody
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
else gets bused to their school
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
just to be thank you for that just to be
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
clear i don't prefer that students take
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
forever to get home or that they have
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
longer routes than necessary the purpose
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
of my bill is to make it
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
fair for what's done for public students
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
is done for chartered schools and
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes terminals bus depots and the
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
like are not the best scenarios for a
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
route to or from school the best
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
scenario would be the connecting the
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
direct flight for lack of a better word
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
or the direct route in a scenario like
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning where it's more
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
complex yes i would imagine the bus
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
coordinators would have to do some more
 
05:14:11.120 --> 05:14:12.150 align:start position:0%
coordinators would have to do some more
um

05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh routing and organizing in that way
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
but it is certainly not the intention at
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
all uh to prolong a student's drive to
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
further questions jefferson woodcock
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow if i may represent if
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
you take the question on representatives
 
05:14:33.520 --> 05:14:34.708 align:start position:0%
you take the question on representatives
comment

05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
i know you were differentiating between
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
his public school and private school and
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
child schoolies
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
but let me give you his exact scenario
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
as it happens with ireland rural area
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
without using the term private
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have five buses
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
pickup youngsters come to the middle
 
05:14:53.920 --> 05:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
pickup youngsters come to the middle
school

05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
everybody gets off there
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the five chatter students as well
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
and from that
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
site a new bus comes it picks just those
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
child students up and takes them away
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me that is not
 
05:15:08.878 --> 05:15:11.270 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me that is not
acceptable

05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
05:15:14.550 --> 05:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that scenario um
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is a unique one certainly
 
05:15:17.520 --> 05:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
that is a unique one certainly
um

05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh you know you start out
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
by saying the scenario is for all public
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
school students and that they're all
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
brought to the middle school
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
those that go to the middle school those
 
05:15:31.830 --> 05:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
that go to the middle school so when the
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
connecting bus comes it picks up only
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
chartered school students correct
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
because all the other kids are at the
 
05:15:38.788 --> 05:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
middle school
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay that would be a depot that would
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
not be well it's a school right right
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes deployed transfer station
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
airplanes makes me seems more cold than
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
it is that that current system they've
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
been using for 40 years not not working
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
for you but in this scenario yeah well
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
okay that's all i got you're clear i got
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
it let me just add to your scenario may
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
i sure if rather than allows it
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:04.798 --> 05:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
just to be clear on what my bill does
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
if in your scenario
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
the public school district students the
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
chartered school district students are
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
all brought to the middle school
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
some stay because they go to the middle
 
05:16:20.160 --> 05:16:24.788 align:start position:0%
some stay because they go to the middle
school

05:16:24.788 --> 05:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
well this is my scenario
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
go to the middle school
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
those that go there stay
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
a bus comes up and picks up chartered
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
public schools and perhaps some public
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
school students who got dropped off
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
there but they don't go there they get
 
05:16:46.948 --> 05:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
on as well my bill would not apply
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
but we only have one middle school so
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
they all get off there
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay we can go hours on this thing and a
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
lot of different scenarios because there
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different scenarios
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
there are and i just let you know one
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
last one i'm looking at
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do the same thing with
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
all our students on an activity bus
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
after school
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
running that around through haverhill we
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
cannot do it and keep those kids on for
 
05:17:12.550 --> 05:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
less than an hour and a half some of the
 
05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
kids riding on that bus
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
so the same thing would occur we'd have
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
to consolidate you know instead of using
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
all the transfer sites and the different
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
buses we have we'd have to use one bus
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that one bus scenario i'll be honest
 
05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
with you it won't work in my town
 
05:17:30.550 --> 05:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
because we have just two we have 96
 
05:17:32.550 --> 05:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
miles of road
 
05:17:32.560 --> 05:17:33.670 align:start position:0%
miles of road
and

05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
kids are scattered all over and this is
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
all rule back in the country type living
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh they'd be on the bus for well over
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
the time that we're allowed to keep us
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
up by kids on the bus due to education
 
05:17:45.680 --> 05:17:46.628 align:start position:0%
up by kids on the bus due to education
rule

05:17:46.628 --> 05:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
and and good safety and best practice
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
so i think that you know there are a lot
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
of scenarios which we got to work out
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
and i'd be glad to work with you and
 
05:17:59.430 --> 05:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
trying to work some of these
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
these difficult situations out
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
without a doubt and i think you'll enjoy
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from the speakers coming after
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
me as well thank you very much
 
05:18:08.638 --> 05:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
me as well thank you very much
uh

05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
are these
 
05:18:11.680 --> 05:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
are these
ones

05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
sorry kim lavalley from mont vernon
 
05:18:38.550 --> 05:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you it's good to be back
 
05:18:42.788 --> 05:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
um i am speaking in support of hb 1453
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
and again i would just like to stress
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
line 11
 
05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
public school unless the use of such
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
transfer stations depots or terminals
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
also applies to the transportation of
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
non-chartered public school students
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
equal transportation i understand that
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're i'm not going to rehash a number
 
05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
of scenarios that everybody's talking
 
05:19:03.040 --> 05:19:04.230 align:start position:0%
of scenarios that everybody's talking
about

05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
but just trying to keep it equal making
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
sure that the charter kiddos are not the
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
ones getting dropped if it can be
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
avoided and having them get
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
to their school in a timely manner as
 
05:19:14.958 --> 05:19:17.190 align:start position:0%
to their school in a timely manner as
well

05:19:17.190 --> 05:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%

not seeing your hands thank you very
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%

attorney best
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%

for the opportunity to be here for the
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
third time today um to talk about the
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill um again my name is bob best i'm
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
from merrimack and i've got a lot of
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
involvement with a whole bunch of
 
05:20:00.868 --> 05:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
charter schools and i won't bore you
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
with all the ins and outs and details of
 
05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
that um i think that some of the message
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
that you've heard for the presentation
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill is what i want to focus on
 
05:20:10.390 --> 05:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that i touch on
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
some of the scenarios that we've heard
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
05:20:16.550 --> 05:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is really i call it sort of
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
equal protection
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
the equal treatment
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
treat all the students in this district
 
05:20:22.948 --> 05:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
the same if you use depots for your
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
students then you can use them for
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
charter school students that's fine
 
05:20:28.948 --> 05:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
kearsarge and sitting on the waiting the
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
bus if that's what you do for the for
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
the public school students
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely fine to do it for charter
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
school students use terminals as long as
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing it equally for everybody
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
so be it it is what it is but treat
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
everybody fairly don't do it for charter
 
05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
school students if you don't do it for
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
the traditional public school students
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is really all
 
05:20:50.240 --> 05:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is really all
about

05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:20:53.910 --> 05:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the places that this happens
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
um pre-covered
 
05:20:58.390 --> 05:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
there were some situations where
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
even though the existing law says use
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
the same buses and routes
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
they were not using the same buses and
 
05:21:05.830 --> 05:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
routes they were bringing all the
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
charter school students to a terminal
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
and everybody else that wasn't a charter
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
school student got some other kind of a
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and that's just not fair
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
charter school students are public
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
school students like any other and they
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't deserve second class treatment on
 
05:21:18.240 --> 05:21:20.310 align:start position:0%
don't deserve second class treatment on
that

05:21:20.310 --> 05:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
but if the school district uses
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
terminals and they use them successfully
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
as you described
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
terminals are hard you talked about
 
05:21:27.750 --> 05:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
supervision what do you do when the
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
supervision isn't there all that has to
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
be worked out but if you're using
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
terminals for all the district schools
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
fine that's okay use it for the charter
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
schools too
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
just don't use it for one set of
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
students and not the others
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
during covid the use of terminals really
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
expanded especially in manchester
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
with good reason it was all the reasons
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
that you talk about busing is
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
really challenged right now hard to find
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
drivers hard to find the costs hard to
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
find space on the bus where you have
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
less kids on the bus because you're
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
trying to keep them all a few feet apart
 
05:22:01.830 --> 05:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
all of that um and so it got more
 
05:22:01.840 --> 05:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
all of that um and so it got more
complicated

05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the way that manchester did that was
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
they had terminals located around the
 
05:22:08.708 --> 05:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
city where all the parents had to bring
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
their own kid to the terminal from home
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then from the terminal they would be
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
taken to their school
 
05:22:15.360 --> 05:22:16.948 align:start position:0%
taken to their school
and

05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:18.628 --> 05:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
lots of reasons to criticize that and
 
05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
not love it especially with the little
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
little kiddos the four and
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds and them sort of
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
all the best supervision that you're
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
when that system is sort of
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
put behind us for
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
the other schools in town
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
but the charter school students still
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
have to have their parents bring them
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
from home to a terminal to get on a bus
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
to go to the charter school
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
you've got a clearly unfair unequal
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
treatment of schools for no reason other
 
05:22:52.480 --> 05:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
treatment of schools for no reason other
than

05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:22:53.760 --> 05:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
than
we

05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a preferential treatment for public
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
school students and not for charter
 
05:22:59.430 --> 05:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
school students and that's really what
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
getting at and
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
and is the important thing to tackle
 
05:23:07.750 --> 05:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
charter school students are not second
 
05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
class citizens they don't deserve when
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
they go to a terminal they're actually
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the bus longer because they go from
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
home to you pick the school they get off
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
the bus and they sit and they wait and
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the wintertime they wait in snow or
 
05:23:22.390 --> 05:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
they go into the gym or whatever and
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's trying to supervise them but
 
05:23:25.030 --> 05:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
they don't really know the kiddo because
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's not from their school
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
but they you know can count heads and
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
they do their best to try to keep track
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
of all of them um
 
05:23:33.510 --> 05:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
in one situation with one of the charter
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
schools that i represent they did have
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
kids go missing at the middle school
 
05:23:38.788 --> 05:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
that they were at the other elementary
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
school that they were brought to
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
um and you know caused that momentary
 
05:23:42.798 --> 05:23:44.310 align:start position:0%
um and you know caused that momentary
panic

05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
panic
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
but if you're doing all of those kinds
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
of things as a matter of your usual
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
course fine so be it
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
but if you're not if you're going to
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
give better bus service to the local
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
kids than you are to the charter school
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
kids it's not fair that's not right it's
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
not what the original statute before
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment intended and it's
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not what should happen with
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
as to all the scenarios about hey this
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
works for us and we've got a scenario
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
and all the kids come to those things if
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's the system you're using in the
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
district for the public schools where
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're using transfers or terminals or
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
depots or whatever you want to call them
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
so be it go ahead continue to use those
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
um i'd love it to be better um but
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
the kids on the bus longer when they
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
come from home wait around at a bus
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
terminal for the right bus to arrive and
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
then get a second ride to another place
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're waiting at that school for five
 
05:24:34.708 --> 05:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
minutes or 10 minutes or 20 minutes and
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
then they've got another ride to the
 
05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
other school
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
that makes the the kiddo school day
 
05:24:39.840 --> 05:24:40.948 align:start position:0%
that makes the the kiddo school day
longer

05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
longer
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
it makes them
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know experience a different
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
educational experience than other kids
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
in their school district and that's not
 
05:24:48.160 --> 05:24:49.670 align:start position:0%
in their school district and that's not
right

05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
those those
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
kids have activities and homework and
 
05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
all that
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
just like every other kiddo and the time
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
on the bus matters just as much for them
 
05:25:00.548 --> 05:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
as it does for others
 
05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
i anticipate there's a little bit of
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about special after school
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
weekend saturday even in the earlier
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
building was discussed about saturday
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
none of these bills deal with anything
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
to do with extracurricular activities or
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
club sports or
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
weekends or any of those kinds of things
 
05:25:18.150 --> 05:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
the statute only the original statute
 
05:25:19.750 --> 05:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
only requires transportation to school
 
05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
for school days
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's never required any of those other
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
things so even a school district that
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
provides transportation doesn't have to
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for the golf team
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
or the baseball team
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to do so it's not
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
legally required and sometimes they make
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
choices sometimes they allow it for one
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
sport and not for other sports those
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
things happen all the time and it's got
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what's going on in
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is simply about
 
05:25:44.240 --> 05:25:45.270 align:start position:0%
this is simply about
saying

05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:25:47.430 --> 05:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
when a parent exercises their choice
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
which is what charter schools are
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
educational choice i want to go to a
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
different school for whatever my reasons
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
that my kid is still
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the town we're treated
 
05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
equally we're all we're all the same
 
05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you sir for
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you are saying
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
that the scenario that representative
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
woodcock had presented where all the
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
kids in the town are brought to the
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
middle school
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
middle school kids go into the classroom
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the charter school kids get on a bus to
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
the charter school is not allowed under
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
i i there was a bunch of different
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
scenarios discussed and it's important
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
to sort of understand the details of
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
each individual one but um
 
05:26:46.150 --> 05:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
understand that the use of terminals
 
05:26:48.548 --> 05:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
today or or that kind of thing is
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
already exceedingly rare before covid
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of school districts
 
05:26:54.150 --> 05:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
that were doing it and most of them were
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what what could be done in
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
this situation you have buses that come
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
from around town they drop the kids off
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
at one school and then they go to the
 
05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
other school and drop the kids off at
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
the other school
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's five more minutes down the road and
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the buses are on their way
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what you know manchester has
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
done and virtually every other school
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
district where there's a charter school
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
but that's not allowed in this bill
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
you of course that's a lot in this bill
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but their kids were charter kids
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
were waiting at the middle school for
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
another bus that's not allowed
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
not unless unless the school district
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
my apology
 
05:27:30.868 --> 05:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
get too excited
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
the middle is the whole town
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
all the middle school age children in
 
05:27:36.390 --> 05:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
the town are brought to the middle
 
05:27:36.400 --> 05:27:38.150 align:start position:0%
the town are brought to the middle
school

05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
most of them go to the middle school
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
five of them go to a charter school all
 
05:27:44.310 --> 05:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
the other kids go into the middle school
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
the five kids that go to a charter
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
school get on another bus that takes
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
them to the charter school
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
that's not allowed under your bill no um
 
05:27:52.878 --> 05:27:53.670 align:start position:0%
that's not allowed under your bill no um
well

05:27:53.670 --> 05:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know if i get to claim
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
it be my bill but um yeah yes that would
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
not be allowed so what if it was the
 
05:28:02.150 --> 05:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
same bus what if all the children got
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
off the bus except for the same
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
five charter school kids and they went
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the same bus to the charter school
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
would that be allowed yeah
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
of course
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
what's the difference
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
um you're treating all the students
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
fairly you're treating them all equally
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
they all get treated with the same
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
system we don't employ terminals and
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
make kids get off the bus and get back
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the bus and know which bus lee or
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
maybe they miss their bus at that
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
transfer terminal which has happened
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
all of those things are possible
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
treat them like you do every other
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
student make your you know
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
really what happens with the solution is
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
much simpler than that because the bus
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
companies are really good at making
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
routes and they figure it out but all
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
the other students aren't staying on the
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
bus and going to the charter school
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
so they can't be treated the same
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
because they're going to two different
 
05:28:48.878 --> 05:28:49.910 align:start position:0%
because they're going to two different
places

05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
places
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure that if i was asking you to
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
drop them off at the charter school
 
05:28:55.270 --> 05:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
first we wouldn't even
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'd survive that
 
05:28:58.948 --> 05:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
conversation but yeah again there's got
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
to be some level of difference obviously
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
the kids got to get off of the bus at
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
different places
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay are there further questions
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
not see any questions thank you very
 
05:29:07.920 --> 05:29:08.868 align:start position:0%
not see any questions thank you very
much

05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
and the last individual on this bill is
 
05:29:28.470 --> 05:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.070 --> 05:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
my apologies again i didn't mean to talk
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again members of the
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee thank you chairman lad barry
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
christina school boards association
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
opposed i'm not going to spend a lot of
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
time on this bill i think
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns on hsba have uh has are
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
have been sufficiently flushed out um
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
first i do want to thank representative
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
mooney for a couple of things her desire
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
to try and help kids that seem to be
 
05:30:07.110 --> 05:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
having um some challenges is is obvious
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
so we we appreciate
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
her dedication to this issue second i
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
would also like to thank representative
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
mooney for um clarifying
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
what a um a transfer station is and she
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
means that in the context of bus
 
05:30:20.400 --> 05:30:21.990 align:start position:0%
means that in the context of bus
transportation

05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm not lying when i first read the
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill i expected to come in here and hear
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
some horror story that a public school
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
was dropping some kids off at the town
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
dump and they were having to wait for
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
another i swear to god that's what
 
05:30:33.910 --> 05:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's what i that's what i thought it
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
was about when i was expecting to hear i
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
was expecting to hear that story which
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest with him
 
05:30:42.868 --> 05:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have necessarily surprised me
 
05:30:42.878 --> 05:30:44.150 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have necessarily surprised me
um

05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
um anyway uh uh uh
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the two point the logistics i think
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative mullen you sort of
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
everybody kind of talked about that
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative lakers you talked about
 
05:30:55.990 --> 05:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
how geographically large some of our
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
school districts are um and you know you
 
05:31:01.270 --> 05:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
know a kid may live in the northwest
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
corner of manchester and his or her
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
charter school may be in the southwest
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
so kid lives in the northwest the
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools in the southeast corner
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
we have to find a way to get the child
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
there there may be no other option other
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
than having a centralized location just
 
05:31:18.628 --> 05:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
for logistics for time for money for
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
cost um i also want to thank
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
representative mooney she talked about i
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
think representative lake as who was
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned you you mentioned maybe have
 
05:31:26.240 --> 05:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned you you mentioned maybe have
um

05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
established guidelines for student
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
oversight and supervision and things of
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
that nature and representative mooney
 
05:31:33.750 --> 05:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
did say
 
05:31:35.270 --> 05:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
another level of bureaucracy another
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
level of guidelines for our teachers and
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
our administrators who are already sort
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
of burdened with with other
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so we appreciate that
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
angle as well too um that's going to
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
conclude our testimony everybody uh the
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
conversation sort of brought out a lot
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that we have so i won't
 
05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
belabor the point
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to the bill uh and i'm
 
05:31:55.830 --> 05:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions are there
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
 
05:31:57.120 --> 05:31:58.548 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
association

05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
i got one for you
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
are we required to tr transport high
 
05:32:06.310 --> 05:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
school students on a school bus uh thank
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative no
 
05:32:11.430 --> 05:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
transportation is for uh grades one
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
through eight i don't think we've added
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten to that yet technically
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah so now the follow-up
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
to that is that we call school off
 
05:32:21.430 --> 05:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
because it's uh you know there's no
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
school that day but the charter school
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
does have it it's a charter school
 
05:32:26.548 --> 05:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
high school kid
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
are we then bound but you know of course
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
statute says we don't transport we don't
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
have to transport high school kids but
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
because we normally do it as a courtesy
 
05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
would we have to then
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
run the high school student that's a
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
good question i don't know if
 
05:32:43.270 --> 05:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
if i think the previous bill that we
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
talked about i don't i should have
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
brought my computer up to pull up the
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
pertinent statute i believe it says
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
something along the the same the charter
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
school children
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um or students shall be entitled to the
 
05:32:53.760 --> 05:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
um or students shall be entitled to the
same

05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
transportation rights i believe it says
 
05:32:59.830 --> 05:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
as a as a as those in the public school
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
i've again i should have brought my
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
computer up with me
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
we would interpret that as meaning that
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
you can't exclude the charter school
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
kids so for example
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding some high schools will
 
05:33:11.280 --> 05:33:12.948 align:start position:0%
my understanding some high schools will
charge

05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
charge
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
a transportation fee for high school
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
um if you want to ride the bus and
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you're a high score you pay 100 bucks a
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
year or something like that i think i
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
would without pulling up the statute i
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
think i would probably interpret that as
 
05:33:25.520 --> 05:33:27.110 align:start position:0%
think i would probably interpret that as
meaning

05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
05:33:29.190 --> 05:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
the charter school kid if they paid the
 
05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
100 hours would also be entitled to the
 
05:33:33.510 --> 05:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the same
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i do have it with me 194
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is the last bill 194 b two
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
paragraph five
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
pupils who reside in the school district
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
in which the charter school is located
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
shall we be provided transportation to
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
that school by the district on the same
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions as provided for
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
non-chartered public school
 
05:33:54.558 --> 05:33:57.990 align:start position:0%
non-chartered public school
uh

05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
shelby i'm sorry pupils who reside in
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the school district in which the
 
05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools located shall
 
05:34:06.628 --> 05:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
be provided transportation to that
 
05:34:09.750 --> 05:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
school by the district on the same terms
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
and conditions as provided for
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
non-chartered public schools attending
 
05:34:14.958 --> 05:34:16.230 align:start position:0%
non-chartered public schools attending
not

05:34:16.230 --> 05:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
in the district and utilizing the same
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
regular bus schedules and routes that
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
are provided to people's attending
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
non-charter public schools so same terms
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
and conditions i will interpret that
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is that's current law just
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
everybody be aware that's current law so
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
if your high school charges a
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
transportation fee for high school
 
05:34:33.990 --> 05:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
students and you have a charter school
 
05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
in your community i would i think i
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
think i would make the connection that
 
05:34:39.750 --> 05:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes the charter school kids attending
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
that high school within your district or
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
your community could also ride the bus
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
but they'd have to pay that
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
transportation fee as well
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
would uh then it be possible or a good
 
05:34:51.990 --> 05:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
idea for us to utilize the same policy
 
05:34:53.670 --> 05:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
we have for
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
high school students going to the ctes
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
where we reimburse self transportation
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
at 25 cents per mile
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's that story language right now i
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
mean i i hadn't i hadn't considered that
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative that might be that might
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
be one consideration um you know there's
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
a similar language in rsa believe it's
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
189 colon 9 that talks about the public
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
school transporting children who attend
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
a private school within the district and
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
i think the language and that this is
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions i think the i think
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
the language in 189 talks about the same
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
rights and privileges as the children
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
who attend the public school and again
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
we've interpreted that as if the private
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
school does not offer
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me the private school does offer
 
05:35:39.910 --> 05:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
transportation on say a saturday the
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
public school does not have to provide
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
that and how that works out with with
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the school calendar and vacations and
 
05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
snow days i would presume would be
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
similar so
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's for private that's for private
 
05:35:52.708 --> 05:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
schools but i think there's always some
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
corollary language that
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
and and hypotheticals that we could use
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
relative to these last two bills thank
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
you very much are there further
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not saying
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and that
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%

05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
you have two more i guess yes yes
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
so the next bill which we're going to go
 
05:36:19.840 --> 05:36:21.350 align:start position:0%
so the next bill which we're going to go
into

there's a note here in my testimony

wait
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
and cannot find fall behind
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1428 will be a tremendous
 
05:40:47.110 --> 05:40:47.120 align:start position:0%

to ensure special education services are
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:57.510 --> 05:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
i cannot emphasize and i am very
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
passionate about this
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
services have to be number one provided
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
number two on time
 
05:41:13.750 --> 05:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
or the results can be disastrous
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
no more
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
if my bill passes
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
we owe the students
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
far better
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
than things i've seen things i'm hearing
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
about things that come up constantly
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
i would ask this committee's support of
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1428's passage thank you mr
 
05:41:31.680 --> 05:41:33.030 align:start position:0%
house bill 1428's passage thank you mr
chair

05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes i'm sorry representative nelson
 
05:41:44.470 --> 05:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
what if the specialists cannot be found
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know they don't exist because
 
05:41:46.000 --> 05:41:47.190 align:start position:0%
you know they don't exist because
there's

05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
everybody needs them and they they're
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
not around what happens to the charter
 
05:41:53.590 --> 05:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
school if they can't find him either
 
05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
i would say in that scenario
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
assuming my bill are you is your
 
05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
scenario related to the passage of my
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill and that happens okay
 
05:42:03.600 --> 05:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
bill and that happens okay
um

05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:07.750 --> 05:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
if that happens your scenario which i
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
hope it doesn't but it may you're right
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are very specialized people it's
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
hard to find them
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
at a bare minimum
 
05:42:15.760 --> 05:42:16.548 align:start position:0%
at a bare minimum
you

05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
as a house committee and us as a state
 
05:42:21.750 --> 05:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
would allow the charter school to at
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
least start looking start finding and
 
05:42:27.190 --> 05:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
start the process to locate that person
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
to provide the services that are needed
 
05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and to provide them timely
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
so yes it may be a scenario like you say
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully not but that's possible all
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
things are
 
05:42:38.240 --> 05:42:39.510 align:start position:0%
things are
um

05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would be unfortunate
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know but perhaps there could be
 
05:42:43.990 --> 05:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
other alternatives perhaps there could
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
be a brainstorm meeting to figure out
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
how to provide the services but my bill
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
would keep people on a timeline and make
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure that conversation happens sooner
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:05.830 --> 05:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you represent
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
when you're taking my question as i read
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
this it seems to give the charter school
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
a blank check of sorts in that it
 
05:43:17.430 --> 05:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
simply says that if during the if the
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
two-week period if the uh
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
special education services are provided
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
then the
 
05:43:23.680 --> 05:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
then the
sc

05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
sc
 
05:43:26.070 --> 05:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
the chartered public school may hire
 
05:43:28.150 --> 05:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
their chosen specialist
 
05:43:30.150 --> 05:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm concerned about how would you
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
respond to the concern that that's uh
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
a blank check and they could uh
 
05:43:38.070 --> 05:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
spend a million bucks on somebody right
 
05:43:40.390 --> 05:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know um hopefully we won't even get
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
to the point
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
of this having to be enacted or you know
 
05:43:52.230 --> 05:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
having to spend so much money on various
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
specialists and so forth hopefully that
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
won't happen
 
05:43:58.628 --> 05:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
especially if my bill passage passes
 
05:44:00.708 --> 05:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
then you know it would provide these
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines so that hopefully
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
services will be provided specialists
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
will be obtained
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i can only think
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
my experience with charter schools those
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
behind me
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
run such a tight ship
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
with finances and budgeting and the like
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
i i would be hard-pressed to think any
 
05:44:25.350 --> 05:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
chartered school would go wild
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
not spending money in areas they
 
05:44:29.910 --> 05:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and so forth
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
i see my bill
 
05:44:31.760 --> 05:44:33.110 align:start position:0%
i see my bill
only

05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
assisting the situation
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
providing the guidelines available
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
and um and hopefully we won't even get
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
to the point where charter school will
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
have to contract someone but it may
 
05:44:44.638 --> 05:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
have to contract someone but it may
happen

05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
if the uh sending district don't keep
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
their end of um
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
obligations and so on
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i i don't foresee um
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
your scenario knowing how charter
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
schools are run in new hampshire
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
happening anytime soon
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you anything further
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative ellison thank you mr
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
question and you may be the wrong person
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
to answer this but uh i'll ask you
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
do the the time frames that are
 
05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
specified in your bill do they apply to
 
05:45:19.830 --> 05:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
special education plans for students in
 
05:45:23.430 --> 05:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:23.440 --> 05:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
i guess to answer that i would say my my
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
focus is the charter is the chartered
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
and whereas it's been explained earlier
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the public school
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the resident public school
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much manages the special
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
education in conjunction with the
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
chartered school
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
i tend to think
 
05:45:52.470 --> 05:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't see a bill like this coming
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
forward from the public school system
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
because everything is so accessible
 
05:45:58.080 --> 05:45:59.350 align:start position:0%
because everything is so accessible
there

05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
in where they're located
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
a time frame
 
05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
is in order in that regard but you're
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
right i could be the wrong person and
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps others can expand on whether or
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
not such a time frame exists for them
 
05:46:13.680 --> 05:46:14.708 align:start position:0%
not such a time frame exists for them
follow-up

05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
only the question would then be since we
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't really know the answer or we may
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
get it from someone else
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
before we were talking about
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
transportation we talked about parity
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
parity between charter school students
 
05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
and transportation public school
 
05:46:32.470 --> 05:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
students in transportation
 
05:46:34.390 --> 05:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
i guess my question would be
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
given your bill if it's enacted will we
 
05:46:39.190 --> 05:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
have parity between the provision of
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
special education services to charter
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
school students and to public school
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
students i hope so
 
05:46:50.470 --> 05:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you president woodcut
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman uh kodeli uh
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
question i have a couple of them um
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
i was following up with representative
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
moffett's question and i understand the
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
the physical uh con
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
priority of the charter school how well
 
05:47:08.470 --> 05:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
they budget their money and and
 
05:47:10.470 --> 05:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes how little they have
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
um that being said however and i'm
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
looking at section two
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say what the qualifications
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the person being hired are in order
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
to say what price you're going to hire
 
05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
them for i would have the same concern
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
that if in fact a
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
a specialist for instance was not
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
available and you knew someone down the
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
street i said yep i'll do it for 250 an
 
05:47:35.430 --> 05:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
hour okay i'll tell you five hours a day
 
05:47:36.948 --> 05:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden this public school
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
building has a non-certified
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
professional getting paid
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand dollars by the waiting
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
times ten days um which which you know
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
as unfortunately as
 
05:47:48.868 --> 05:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh reverend ellison referred to
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes in public education if you
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
can't get the
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
specific specialist they're still
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
waiting and that that's unfair to the
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
parent i'm not suggesting that but to to
 
05:47:59.590 --> 05:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
be able to offer this financial piece so
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
is that that's the first part of my
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
question is i mean that does that seem a
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable understanding for that
 
05:48:04.080 --> 05:48:06.310 align:start position:0%
reasonable understanding for that
section

05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i wouldn't um
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
i you know my familiarity with charter
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
schools which is pretty extensive i've
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
never known them to contract um someone
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
who was not qualified for a various
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
position uh especially when it comes to
 
05:48:22.948 --> 05:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
special education a lot of times
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
i plan special education plans will
 
05:48:27.510 --> 05:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
who is needed to perform what and so it
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
comes sometimes from that guiding
 
05:48:32.240 --> 05:48:33.510 align:start position:0%
comes sometimes from that guiding
document

05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:48:37.670 --> 05:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't for like representative
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
scenario over here i don't foresee a
 
05:48:41.910 --> 05:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
scenario as you're saying either
 
05:48:43.750 --> 05:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay if i may
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
so if the plane only calls for a one on
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
one eight and they have the 108 yes um
 
05:48:50.788 --> 05:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
that does that doesn't mean that they
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
based on what you're saying the so we're
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
not looking for an ot person or a pt
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
person or a speech person they're saying
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
we need a one-on-one aid
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh to help with child services so but
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
this allows this charter school to
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
hire anyone they choose
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for professional
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
certification and pay them what they
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
choose to do under this bill i
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
understand you wouldn't do it they may
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
not do it but it will allow it to happen
 
05:49:16.230 --> 05:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh and the second one is if i
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
last one miscarriage
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
on part a we were talking about the two
 
05:49:21.350 --> 05:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
weeks to start of school i thought i
 
05:49:22.628 --> 05:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
heard this morning from the director of
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
05:49:23.760 --> 05:49:25.110 align:start position:0%
special ed
that

05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:49:27.270 --> 05:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't occur
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:49:30.390 --> 05:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
is not a entity in terms of special ed
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
they would be uh dealing with the parent
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
so this if i'm reading number one
 
05:49:40.628 --> 05:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
correctly you're asking them to finalize
 
05:49:42.390 --> 05:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
a review between this and the china
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
public school but they're saying their
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
connection would be
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the parent because the part the
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
child school doesn't have a standing as
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
the lea
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question um
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes but you see the chartered public
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
school has to work with the sending
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
district on special education
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i understand i understand that i'm
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
saying what the what we heard this
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
morning was that the first thing that
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
the child the lea has to work with is
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
the parent i'm not suggesting they
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't work with child school we're
 
05:50:13.910 --> 05:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
not talking invitations talk about the
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
way you have it aligned they have to
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
work with the china public school and
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
the director of the swine said their
 
05:50:20.868 --> 05:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
point of contact is the parent
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mullen
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:50:31.990 --> 05:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
have you had the opportunity to meet
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the special education director in

discuss how
 
05:50:41.200 --> 05:50:42.070 align:start position:0%
discuss how
this

05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:42.080 --> 05:50:43.270 align:start position:0%
this
would

05:50:43.270 --> 05:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
happen or
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
how this would interface with current
 
05:50:47.520 --> 05:50:49.110 align:start position:0%
how this would interface with current
practices

05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
practices
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:58.390 --> 05:50:58.400 align:start position:0%

05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
have you met with the special ed
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
director of any public school system to
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
talk about how this would work
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i've met with
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
um this is one in my series of you know
 
05:51:13.110 --> 05:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
coming directly from the chartered
 
05:51:13.120 --> 05:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
coming directly from the chartered
school

05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
i communicate very often with those who
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
operate charter schools or on boards
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
foundations and so on
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
their experiences
 
05:51:27.270 --> 05:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
in discussing in working with special
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
education directors where they are
 
05:51:29.280 --> 05:51:30.708 align:start position:0%
education directors where they are
located

05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
located
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
comes into play here i don't know
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what their opinions are
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know the special education
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
directors at the public schools about
 
05:51:43.270 --> 05:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
the timeline that i've put forward
 
05:51:46.628 --> 05:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
my intent was to look after the special
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
education students who are in the
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools who sometimes
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
don't keep to any timeline because
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
services on the sending district side
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you see no further questions thank
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you very
 
05:52:05.360 --> 05:52:06.708 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you very
much

05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman chairman i'm kim
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
lavalley from mont vernon and i'm
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of
 
05:52:33.600 --> 05:52:34.830 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of
hb

05:52:34.830 --> 05:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
hb
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
1428 i'd like to follow up on a few
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
areas of conversation with
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative mooney
 
05:52:44.470 --> 05:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
overall i would say most of the sending
 
05:52:46.948 --> 05:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
districts are doing their absolute best
 
05:52:49.350 --> 05:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
to work with the charter schools they're
 
05:52:49.360 --> 05:52:50.868 align:start position:0%
to work with the charter schools they're
trying

05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
trying
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're in a different location we're in a
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
different building and it's not as easy
 
05:52:58.150 --> 05:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
to run down the hall and try to rectify
 
05:52:59.830 --> 05:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
something we're we're in a different
 
05:52:59.840 --> 05:53:00.788 align:start position:0%
something we're we're in a different
place

05:53:00.788 --> 05:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
so what we're really trying to do with
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is make sure that we have
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
everything worked out whether they want
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
to send people to us
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
that they've approved from their
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
district or they want to contract they
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
want us to contract with them for
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for services which means
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
we have to hire the appropriate people
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the licenses or certifications that
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
are required
 
05:53:25.350 --> 05:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
and we would hire them as our employees
 
05:53:27.990 --> 05:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
or 1099 them with an agreement through
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
the sending district we're trying to
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that whatever the arrangement
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
is it's in place for the kids on the
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
first day of school if we're just
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
starting these conversations the second
 
05:53:39.910 --> 05:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
week of school because it's busy for the
 
05:53:41.670 --> 05:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
districts we get that
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
but if we're starting conversations the
 
05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
second or third week of school we may
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
not see services show up until october
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a disagreement on services it
 
05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
becomes even more challenging so the
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
goal is to get services in the building
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
with an agreement with the sending
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
district that's the goal we don't want
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
to go out and hire people just because
 
05:54:04.000 --> 05:54:05.190 align:start position:0%
to go out and hire people just because
um

05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know any charter school that
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
would go out and hire somebody for some
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of money who wasn't
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
qualified i've never seen that doesn't
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
mean i mean doesn't mean it can't happen
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
but i've never seen it
 
05:54:15.760 --> 05:54:16.628 align:start position:0%
but i've never seen it
so

05:54:16.628 --> 05:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:19.510 --> 05:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
really our goal is to make this work
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the kids that have
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
services so that we can get them in
 
05:54:24.000 --> 05:54:24.948 align:start position:0%
services so that we can get them in
place

05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
on time and the kids benefit if they're
 
05:54:29.350 --> 05:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
missing services
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a month or two or three it has an
 
05:54:33.670 --> 05:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
impact on their education has an impact
 
05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the school has an impact on their
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
family and it's just not in their best
 
05:54:37.440 --> 05:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
family and it's just not in their best
interest

05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.310 --> 05:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
i i'll go back to i don't think we're
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking for a blank check by any means
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
our goal is to coordinate with the
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
districts that's really what we want and
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
again most of the districts are really
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
good about it but there are some
 
05:54:56.310 --> 05:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
districts where you know you want an mou
 
05:54:58.230 --> 05:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
you're approaching them for an mou there
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
was sb 238 yesterday
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of charter schools want to
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
work out an mou and it's very difficult
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
to get a response
 
05:55:09.030 --> 05:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
i can give you i'm not going to give you
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
the name of the district if i can tell
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
you what it's almost a year out and
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's still no mou for the students
 
05:55:16.708 --> 05:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
so you're hiring people
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
at their instruction
 
05:55:20.230 --> 05:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
you're hoping the payment comes through
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's no agreement in place for the
 
05:55:21.840 --> 05:55:22.708 align:start position:0%
there's no agreement in place for the
year

05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
but you're trying to do what's right for
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
the kids and sometimes you have to hire
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
an extra person because schedules are
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
tighter when a smaller school less
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
teachers less classes and so forth
 
05:55:34.548 --> 05:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
compared to the large district so really
 
05:55:36.070 --> 05:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we just want the
 
05:55:38.070 --> 05:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
kids to get the services in a timely
 
05:55:40.948 --> 05:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
manner in an agreement with the sending
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
district it's their responsibility it's
 
05:55:46.470 --> 05:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
their document we want to work with them
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you if i could just ask a question
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
the example you just mentioned
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
there is a district that has been trying
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
to work out services with the resident
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
school district for a child in the
 
05:56:02.628 --> 05:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
charter for a year
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
but that has not happened and the
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
charter charters had to
 
05:56:06.480 --> 05:56:07.350 align:start position:0%
charter charters had to
hire

05:56:07.350 --> 05:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
hire
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
someone to provide the services
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
called for in the iep is that
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
what you were indicating
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
what i'm indicating is the charter
 
05:56:19.350 --> 05:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
school is providing the services
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the iep for a number of students
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
without an mou in place
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
there's a need for an extra special
 
05:56:26.558 --> 05:56:28.708 align:start position:0%
there's a need for an extra special
educator

05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
educator
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
the mou there's no guarantee i mean you
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
really want that agreement for a payment
 
05:56:38.548 --> 05:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
you want to be in agreement on your
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
payments what you're paying people what
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
they're reimbursing you so that it's
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
nice and clean
 
05:56:45.910 --> 05:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
so it's an mou that's missing services
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions represent
 
05:56:52.558 --> 05:56:53.590 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions represent

05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
moffitt
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sheeran thank you for
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
so when lines nine and ten it refers to
 
05:57:01.110 --> 05:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
the the chartered public school may hire
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
or contract with their chosen specialist
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
now by the school hiring we talking
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
about an iep team could you clarify a
 
05:57:10.390 --> 05:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
little bit what we mean by the school
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
hiring someone i believe the
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
the goal is to be able to hire if it's a
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
special educator to hire a special
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
educator if it's occupational therapy
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we've agreed that the school is
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
providing it then we can hire one if the
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
sending district hasn't sent somebody
 
05:57:28.558 --> 05:57:29.590 align:start position:0%
sending district hasn't sent somebody
we

05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to be ready with services
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up yep
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:34.878 --> 05:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:39.670 --> 05:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm one i mentioned before my concern
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
about a possible blank check scenario
 
05:57:44.230 --> 05:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
which robertson mooney responded to i'm
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
also wondering about a search process
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it a bid process
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
but if there is a need to find a
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
specialist or specialists
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
with no controls over or limits or
 
05:58:01.360 --> 05:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
with no controls over or limits or
guidance

05:58:02.470 --> 05:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
or structure in terms of spending or
 
05:58:05.120 --> 05:58:06.390 align:start position:0%
or structure in terms of spending or
searching

05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
searching
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
um what if there are like
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
two possible specialists and one costs
 
05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand one costs a hundred
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
thousand i'm just wondering i'm just
 
05:58:18.150 --> 05:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh quality control so to
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
speak you're tracking my concern
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't really it's fairly
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
open-ended in those regards i'm just
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about blank checks and quality
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
control and and
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
bids can you speak to that at all
 
05:58:35.670 --> 05:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
as it stands today we try to find the
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
best person for the job
 
05:58:43.030 --> 05:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
in a price
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
range that is compatible with the local
 
05:58:45.680 --> 05:58:46.788 align:start position:0%
range that is compatible with the local
districts

05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who reimburse for
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
services when there's a contract in
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
place for that otherwise the districts
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
are looking for them so i would imagine
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
05:58:57.590 --> 05:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
a very similar process we would be
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
looking for somebody that we know what
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're willing to pay most of the time
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
we know what those guidelines are and we
 
05:59:06.310 --> 05:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be looking to stay in that range
 
05:59:08.470 --> 05:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
not trying to hire the most expensive
 
05:59:08.480 --> 05:59:10.548 align:start position:0%
not trying to hire the most expensive
person

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:59:13.030 --> 05:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't it just doesn't make sense
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm tracking you thank you thank you for
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
your question thank you very much are
 
05:59:18.310 --> 05:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
 
05:59:18.320 --> 05:59:19.590 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
porter

05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
porter
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
there seems to be some issues here do
 
05:59:27.430 --> 05:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
you think the issues that
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
are surfacing
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
are because the sending district is the
 
05:59:31.760 --> 05:59:32.868 align:start position:0%
are because the sending district is the
lea

05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
lea
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
and that perhaps if there was a way that
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
the state could figure out that the
 
05:59:38.708 --> 05:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
charter itself would be the lea that
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
that would improve things for you
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's a very tricky question
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
because for us to be the lea we would
 
05:59:47.670 --> 05:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
definitely want to see tax dollars
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
following the student for special
 
05:59:49.520 --> 05:59:52.390 align:start position:0%
following the student for special
education

05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.590 --> 05:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
i do have one concern
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
we talk about this two week period of
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
time that if you if you don't get this
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
service two weeks prior to start of
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
school year then you go forward here
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
what happens when we have
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
and this is where i found as a school
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
teacher and school principal for all
 
06:00:15.990 --> 06:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
those years that we had kids that move
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
in during the course of the school year
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it takes almost sometimes a month
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
month and a half two months before
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
people gear up to get the special
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
service for that particular student
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
coming in you're waiting for records to
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
arrive yes but
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're having to really gear up again
 
06:00:33.520 --> 06:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
you're having to really gear up again
and

06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
do you see this going further than just
 
06:00:38.548 --> 06:00:38.558 align:start position:0%
the two weeks prior to school would it
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
be also when students come into the
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
district or the charter school
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
and you have a a similar type situation
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um i would not
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
want to speak on behalf of
 
06:00:52.470 --> 06:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative mooney typically the
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
transfers when they come in
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the record in my experience anyway the
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
records are coming
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the student fairly close anyway and
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're able to reach out to the district
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
but if you were not getting a response
 
06:01:07.830 --> 06:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
for a few weeks and the child was not
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
receiving services
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the charter school needs to
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
be able to put services in place it's in
 
06:01:15.990 --> 06:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the student
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:01:19.510 --> 06:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
in your dealings with
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:33.670 --> 06:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
i hesitate to
 
06:01:38.230 --> 06:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
answer for them but
 
06:01:38.240 --> 06:01:39.110 align:start position:0%
answer for them but
from

06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:01:42.070 --> 06:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we see in here in general i think
 
06:01:44.470 --> 06:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's a common problem there's a lack of
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
personnel and for a long time charter
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
schools were sent people from the
 
06:01:51.510 --> 06:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
sending district
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
they would send folks over to do it
 
06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools are growing um
 
06:01:59.590 --> 06:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
ieps are
 
06:02:02.230 --> 06:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
growing in charter schools and they are
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
already short staffed i know we've had
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
several districts tell us we we barely
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
get by in our own district we can't send
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
you people so that's fine the child's
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
not down the hall they're down the road
 
06:02:12.718 --> 06:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
not down the hall they're down the road
and

06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
miles over so
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
the easiest solution for a lot of the
 
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
schools lately seems to be to contract
 
06:02:19.680 --> 06:02:20.788 align:start position:0%
schools lately seems to be to contract
out

06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
people that meet their qualifications
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
for a certain dollar amount and i think
 
06:02:27.670 --> 06:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
they're just having a hard time finding
 
06:02:27.680 --> 06:02:28.628 align:start position:0%
they're just having a hard time finding
people

06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and they're strapped
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
with other i mean it's it's a thing
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
across the nation
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you very much mr chair
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's a two-part question one um
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
that being the case why would we think
 
06:02:48.390 --> 06:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
that the charter schools will have an
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
easier time finding personnel
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the second part of the question is
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
have you shared your concerns with the
 
06:02:58.948 --> 06:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
we well i have had conversations with
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
people at the department of ed not
 
06:03:04.160 --> 06:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
people at the department of ed not
the

06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
ladies here today but other people that
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
work at the department of ed and charter
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
schools we've had
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
general conversations about how
 
06:03:13.590 --> 06:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
challenging it can be
 
06:03:13.600 --> 06:03:15.750 align:start position:0%
challenging it can be
um

06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i forgot you had the first part of
 
06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
that excuse me the first part was um
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
why um should we think that the charters
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
will be able to find people easier than
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
the public schools
 
06:03:29.110 --> 06:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we're finding them
 
06:03:31.590 --> 06:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
easier but we are finding them
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
slowly but surely we are finding them so
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide the services as
 
06:03:39.270 --> 06:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
required in the ieps
 
06:03:39.280 --> 06:03:40.548 align:start position:0%
required in the ieps
yes

06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
can you do it in a two-week turnaround
 
06:03:43.680 --> 06:03:44.788 align:start position:0%
can you do it in a two-week turnaround
um

06:03:44.788 --> 06:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:46.470 --> 06:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you sit on the phone long enough in
 
06:03:47.910 --> 06:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
your computer you'd be amazed what you
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
can find
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
it's not always perfect i'm not saying
 
06:03:54.948 --> 06:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
we're better than the sending districts
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
but we're smaller
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's just reaching out to
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
your parent community and they know
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
people as long as they have the
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
qualifications and it's within the
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
financial parameters
 
06:04:07.270 --> 06:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
and background checks of course all the
 
06:04:10.708 --> 06:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
rest of it but we're able to find them
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
i know some charter schools you know
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
like regular traditional schools we all
 
06:04:16.070 --> 06:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
are missing somebody somewhere at some
 
06:04:16.080 --> 06:04:17.510 align:start position:0%
are missing somebody somewhere at some
point

06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
but we're able to provide the services
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome are there further
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
in a recent conversation with the
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent in the school district in
 
06:04:36.868 --> 06:04:36.878 align:start position:0%
meyer town we had a conversation about
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
finding specialists in special education
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the questions that came up we
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
were just talking about the various
 
06:04:46.230 --> 06:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
disciplines and i was told
 
06:04:48.990 --> 06:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
that the same position in northern
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts paid a hundred thousand
 
06:04:51.520 --> 06:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
massachusetts paid a hundred thousand
dollars

06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
and that we didn't have any provision
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
for getting anywhere near that salary in
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
a situation that's statewide i mean i
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
just don't know it's a naive question
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
what is your understanding of the
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
availability of those kinds of
 
06:05:08.080 --> 06:05:10.230 align:start position:0%
availability of those kinds of
specialists

06:05:10.230 --> 06:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
the availability of a specialist for
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
any special ed field
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're hard to find but you have to
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's a question of just continuing to
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
look until you bring them forward i
 
06:05:26.470 --> 06:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
would imagine if you're competing with
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in southern new hampshire
 
06:05:28.400 --> 06:05:29.190 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in southern new hampshire
that's

06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:05:31.270 --> 06:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
that may be more challenging
 
06:05:33.030 --> 06:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for those schools though
 
06:05:35.430 --> 06:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
um the one that i one that i'm familiar
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
with down there has the people in place
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
no i was just giving that conversation
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
and not having any data or anything i
 
06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you had
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
well we've had people go to
 
06:05:49.350 --> 06:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they make a lot more money
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything thank you very much
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%

association of special ed administrators
 
06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll keep my uh comments brief
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
um as we spoke this morning it is the
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the local school
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
district the resident school district
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
just to oversee
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
every aspect of special education and
 
06:06:48.390 --> 06:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
providing a fape which includes ensuring
 
06:06:48.400 --> 06:06:50.150 align:start position:0%
providing a fape which includes ensuring
that

06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are providing
 
06:06:54.948 --> 06:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
services are licensed credentialed and
 
06:06:57.190 --> 06:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
hold the appropriate
 
06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
credentials for the provision of the
 
06:06:59.440 --> 06:07:00.708 align:start position:0%
credentials for the provision of the
services

06:07:00.708 --> 06:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
in review of the bill that we just
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
listened to we would like to raise a few
 
06:07:05.760 --> 06:07:06.868 align:start position:0%
listened to we would like to raise a few
questions

06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:07:10.868 --> 06:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
the first one is really centered around
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of two weeks before
 
06:07:13.120 --> 06:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of two weeks before
school

06:07:13.990 --> 06:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
providing a schedule
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
ieps are written on a yearly basis so we
 
06:07:21.910 --> 06:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
know what kinds of services need to be
 
06:07:24.470 --> 06:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
provided to all kids but as someone
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned just a few minutes ago at the
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
start of the school year you've got kids
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
moving in you've got kids changing
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
you've got staff who switch positions
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
you've got staff who resign you're
 
06:07:38.948 --> 06:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
hiring people and it can literally be
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
the day before school that you finalize
 
06:07:44.150 --> 06:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
a schedule to ensure that the kids are
 
06:07:45.270 --> 06:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
getting the
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
all of their services and the quality
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
that they need so
 
06:07:52.230 --> 06:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
providing an outside
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh school organization
 
06:07:57.350 --> 06:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
two weeks before a schedule
 
06:07:59.190 --> 06:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's firm
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
is not at all realistic so
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
we would raise some questions around
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
that piece
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we would uh bring
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
to your attention
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
is around the
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
two-week lapse for services and again
 
06:08:17.510 --> 06:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
you you heard uh about the critical
 
06:08:20.150 --> 06:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
shortages in special education the state
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has identified just
 
06:08:25.270 --> 06:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
about every uh special education
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
category special ed teachers uh speech
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
and language
 
06:08:32.708 --> 06:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh our school psychologists our
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral specialists we just can't
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
find them it's not for a lack of trying
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and so to think that in two weeks
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
that someone could find an individual
 
06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that they hold the appropriate
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
credentials that you've gone through the
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
background check and that all of those
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
things could happen outside of the
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
school district being involved and then
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
not even knowing how much you're going
 
06:09:01.750 --> 06:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be charged
 
06:09:03.830 --> 06:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
so we would ask question all of those
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions including um
 
06:09:08.310 --> 06:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
what the rate setting might be for those
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
06:09:10.400 --> 06:09:12.548 align:start position:0%
kinds of
situations

06:09:12.548 --> 06:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
situations
 
06:09:14.948 --> 06:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
let's see what else is in my
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
so those are our major points we really
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
feel as though these kinds of things are
 
06:09:26.628 --> 06:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
really the responsibility of the school
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
district we find that this would be
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
an unrealistic expectation to meet
 
06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
um and would open it up for questions to
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
06:09:59.910 --> 06:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and members of
 
06:10:02.948 --> 06:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you again for the
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
i am still bob best i'm still that
 
06:10:09.590 --> 06:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
charter school guy um
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
very important bill probably the highest
 
06:10:13.030 --> 06:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
priority one of all the charter school
 
06:10:15.110 --> 06:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
bills to me and and
 
06:10:18.390 --> 06:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
my thought and um as before
 
06:10:21.270 --> 06:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
um with each of these bills
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
folks come and talk about adults talking
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
about how
 
06:10:29.430 --> 06:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of these things are hard or it's
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
complicated or things are scarce or they
 
06:10:35.350 --> 06:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
cost a little bit and i'm going to come
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
back before you every single time and
 
06:10:37.200 --> 06:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
back before you every single time and
say

06:10:38.310 --> 06:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
i don't really
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
lose sleep over the fact that adults
 
06:10:44.638 --> 06:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
lose sleep over the fact that adults
have

06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:10:45.520 --> 06:10:46.628 align:start position:0%
have
pressures

06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
pressures
 
06:10:48.788 --> 06:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
the kids are the priorities that's why
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
the schools are there it's to provide
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
those services that the kids need
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that they're lined up
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from representative
 
06:10:56.958 --> 06:10:57.910 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from representative
mooney

06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
mooney
 
06:11:00.150 --> 06:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
when you fall behind in special ed even
 
06:11:02.390 --> 06:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
two weeks or three weeks or four weeks
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
it isn't a shoulder shrug
 
06:11:06.948 --> 06:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
that might set that student behind for
 
06:11:09.430 --> 06:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
the entire school year
 
06:11:11.350 --> 06:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
they may not catch up
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
from not having those services lined up
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's how important this is a lot of
 
06:11:17.910 --> 06:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
school districts do figure it out two
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
weeks ahead of time
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
the existing statute we heard this
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
morning in some discussion about how
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
the lea which is the school district is
 
06:11:28.470 --> 06:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing the special
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
education the statute gives them five
 
06:11:33.430 --> 06:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
different ways to accomplish that five
 
06:11:35.190 --> 06:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
different ways we talk about blank check
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
before you can get to a blank check
 
06:11:39.670 --> 06:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
all of the control resides with the
 
06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
school district they choose what's in an
 
06:11:42.160 --> 06:11:43.190 align:start position:0%
school district they choose what's in an
iep

06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
iep
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
they write it up they develop it with
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
their iep team
 
06:11:48.788 --> 06:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
and then they choose how they're going
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
to implement it and in their own school
 
06:11:52.150 --> 06:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
they do it sometimes with their own
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
staff and sometimes specialists and at a
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
charter school here's what the statute
 
06:11:56.400 --> 06:11:57.270 align:start position:0%
charter school here's what the statute
says

06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:11:59.830 --> 06:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
the resident district may send its staff
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the chartered public school
 
06:12:04.470 --> 06:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
or the resident district may contract
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
with a service provider to provide
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
services at the charter public school
 
06:12:09.200 --> 06:12:10.150 align:start position:0%
services at the charter public school
or

06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:12:11.670 --> 06:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
the resident district may provide
 
06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
services at the residence school
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
district a resident district school
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
the resident district may provide the
 
06:12:21.110 --> 06:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
services at the service provider's
 
06:12:21.120 --> 06:12:22.948 align:start position:0%
services at the service provider's
location

06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
location
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and then the last one the resident
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
district may contract with the chartered
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
public school to provide these services
 
06:12:30.470 --> 06:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
five different opportunities to
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
accomplish this goal which they're
 
06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
obligated by law to provide on an iep
 
06:12:38.628 --> 06:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
that they designed
 
06:12:40.708 --> 06:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that this bill does
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
is say
 
06:12:45.430 --> 06:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you've failed at all of those things
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else can give it a try
 
06:12:50.708 --> 06:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
someone else can go looking for and and
 
06:12:52.230 --> 06:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
i know that there's concern about blank
 
06:12:53.910 --> 06:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
checks and i hear numbers about a fifty
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar export versus a hundred
 
06:12:57.030 --> 06:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar expert really we're
 
06:12:58.708 --> 06:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
talking about special ed teachers that
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
you build forty five dollars an hour for
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's a it's a one-on-one
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
aid that you build 25 an hour for so
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
these aren't numbers on the scale of
 
06:13:09.350 --> 06:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
fifty or a hundred thousand dollars
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
but their qualifications um and who they
 
06:13:14.788 --> 06:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
are are set out in the iep
 
06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the 45 and the 25 are special ed
 
06:13:20.948 --> 06:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
teacher and a paraprofessional
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
if it's an occupational therapist or a
 
06:13:24.788 --> 06:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
speech therapist or whatever it is you
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't hire a neurosurgeon for you know a
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars an hour and slide them
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
in there and call them an occupational
 
06:13:33.270 --> 06:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
therapist that's not what they are
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
and so there really isn't even a blank
 
06:13:36.470 --> 06:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
check even when you get to the bottom of
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
and moreover to the concerns that hey
 
06:13:42.070 --> 06:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the school the charter school
 
06:13:43.830 --> 06:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
would struggle to find people within two
 
06:13:43.840 --> 06:13:45.270 align:start position:0%
would struggle to find people within two
weeks

06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
06:13:47.270 --> 06:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know i would love to have more time
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
you heard from the districts that they
 
06:13:49.750 --> 06:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
don't even think they can provide two
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
weeks of advance notice
 
06:13:53.910 --> 06:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
but what's wrong with allowing the
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
charter school to try
 
06:13:58.628 --> 06:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
and at any point even if you if the
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
school district fails and the charter
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
school is
 
06:14:05.590 --> 06:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
call to action by this bill and goes and
 
06:14:08.070 --> 06:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
looks and finds somebody and says okay
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
school district i found a special ed
 
06:14:09.760 --> 06:14:10.868 align:start position:0%
school district i found a special ed
teacher

06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna do it for pursuant to the
 
06:14:13.680 --> 06:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna do it for pursuant to the
uh

06:14:14.470 --> 06:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative mooney bill um and and
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
charge you for it um if the school
 
06:14:21.030 --> 06:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
district uh corrects that situation and
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
steps in and starts to fill their role
 
06:14:23.600 --> 06:14:24.708 align:start position:0%
steps in and starts to fill their role
then

06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:14:26.150 --> 06:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know the school district stepped up
 
06:14:26.160 --> 06:14:26.868 align:start position:0%
you know the school district stepped up
and

06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
you know used its statutory obligations
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't always have to look
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
out into the industry to find some
 
06:14:35.990 --> 06:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the school district has a
 
06:14:38.390 --> 06:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher or a paraprofessional
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes the district has it sometimes
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
the charter school has it uh sometimes
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's one that's shared between
 
06:14:44.000 --> 06:14:45.510 align:start position:0%
there's one that's shared between
schools

06:14:45.510 --> 06:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes the folks are available and
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
when that happens
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a response to this
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
situation where the first day of school
 
06:14:54.240 --> 06:14:55.270 align:start position:0%
situation where the first day of school
comes

06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
comes
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
and nothing is set up for an iep that
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
was written and known for months and
 
06:15:03.990 --> 06:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
when that happens the current system
 
06:15:09.430 --> 06:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
puts that burden on the parent we talked
 
06:15:12.150 --> 06:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
about is there a two-week gap
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
in other occasions when somebody
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
transfers into the district and all of
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
that um right now the statute the the
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
state of the law is that the parent
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
would then uh go to the state and file
 
06:15:24.230 --> 06:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
for a due process hearing to claim that
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
they are not receiving the free and
 
06:15:28.470 --> 06:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education and they'd
 
06:15:31.510 --> 06:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
prove it to the state and then if they
 
06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
won and they succeeded they would either
 
06:15:34.708 --> 06:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
get their services or they get what's
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
called compensatory services sometimes
 
06:15:37.440 --> 06:15:38.230 align:start position:0%
called compensatory services sometimes
which

06:15:38.230 --> 06:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
are another troubling aspect of this
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't exist either so you
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
can't find anybody to provide the
 
06:15:46.150 --> 06:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
compensatory services but to get to that
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
state hearing and get a result and then
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
move on
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
i dare to say if it happened in a month
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
it would be lightning speed it's
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
probably more like two or three months
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
which is a good chunk of the school year
 
06:16:01.430 --> 06:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that gets away from you
 
06:16:04.310 --> 06:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
when you obligate the parents to do it
 
06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
but you know what happens more often
 
06:16:07.270 --> 06:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
than that
 
06:16:09.350 --> 06:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
the charter school
 
06:16:11.350 --> 06:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
is there with a student in their
 
06:16:11.360 --> 06:16:12.470 align:start position:0%
is there with a student in their
building

06:16:12.470 --> 06:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:16:12.480 --> 06:16:14.708 align:start position:0%
building
and

06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
you there's no charter school
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrator or charter school board of
 
06:16:20.390 --> 06:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
trustees that will tell its staff don't
 
06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
provide those services
 
06:16:23.910 --> 06:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
because they have a heart their students
 
06:16:25.350 --> 06:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
their teachers their school
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
administrators because they they chose
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be in this field for a reason so the
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
charter school steps up and provides the
 
06:16:33.430 --> 06:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
services as uh ms lavallee said with no
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
contract and no compensation
 
06:16:36.000 --> 06:16:36.830 align:start position:0%
contract and no compensation
um

06:16:36.830 --> 06:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:36.840 --> 06:16:38.628 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
06:16:43.110 --> 06:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't respond to that at all
 
06:16:43.120 --> 06:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't respond to that at all
why

06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:16:45.830 --> 06:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
because the parent
 
06:16:48.070 --> 06:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
is satisfied there's their child is
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
getting services parent doesn't care
 
06:16:51.910 --> 06:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
who's paying for it or who's providing
 
06:16:51.920 --> 06:16:52.548 align:start position:0%
who's paying for it or who's providing
it

06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:16:54.310 --> 06:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
my child's getting services i'm not
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to go ask for a state hearing i'm
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
not going to go for a due process
 
06:16:57.680 --> 06:16:58.948 align:start position:0%
not going to go for a due process
hearing

06:16:58.948 --> 06:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
so you end up with a charter school
 
06:17:02.948 --> 06:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
shouldering the cost of what is the
 
06:17:04.708 --> 06:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
statute says is the school district's
 
06:17:04.718 --> 06:17:06.548 align:start position:0%
statute says is the school district's
responsibility

06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:17:08.470 --> 06:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
charter schools do everything that they
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
do on a shoestring budget compared to
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
other schools and they don't receive any
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
compensation for providing special
 
06:17:15.600 --> 06:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
compensation for providing special
education

06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
even mr chair you talked about
 
06:17:21.750 --> 06:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
substitutes to cover for iep meetings
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
all of that money
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
comes from what charter schools had
 
06:17:27.110 --> 06:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
intended to spend on
 
06:17:28.470 --> 06:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know their use their their other
 
06:17:28.480 --> 06:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
you know their use their their other
programs

06:17:30.390 --> 06:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
and you do it because you have to do it
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
you do it because you have a heart you
 
06:17:35.990 --> 06:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
do it because you care about the kids
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
but it's not the right solution
 
06:17:40.708 --> 06:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
the law is that the sending school
 
06:17:42.868 --> 06:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
district is responsible for this the
 
06:17:44.628 --> 06:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
statute gives them five different ways
 
06:17:47.190 --> 06:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
to accomplish it all we're saying is
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
that when that
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
system goes haywire
 
06:17:51.120 --> 06:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
system goes haywire
the

06:17:52.070 --> 06:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:17:54.788 --> 06:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
person left out in the cold the person
 
06:17:56.788 --> 06:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
that shoulders the bird of that
 
06:17:57.990 --> 06:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
is not
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
a 12 year old
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not the student that's left out in
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
the cold when something goes wrong that
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
whatever solution we come up with for
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that special education is
 
06:18:12.628 --> 06:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
really hard the statutes byzantine the
 
06:18:14.788 --> 06:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
requirements set people up to fail
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
whatever we think of that system and
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
those problems which all exist and are
 
06:18:19.030 --> 06:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
all true
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the victim can't be the kid
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
it can't be the kid that's left out in
 
06:18:25.830 --> 06:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the cold
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's got to be another solution and
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill intends to do
 
06:18:32.948 --> 06:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to answer any questions i
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else that i would
 
06:18:37.670 --> 06:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
add to my direct testimony thank you
 
06:18:41.750 --> 06:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for your
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and your friends who've all
 
06:18:49.910 --> 06:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
testified several times i
 
06:18:51.270 --> 06:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
applied to you being here and your
 
06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
intent and your passion and your good
 
06:18:54.948 --> 06:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
folks and
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
forgive me for for
 
06:18:59.350 --> 06:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
circling back to something i've touched
 
06:19:00.628 --> 06:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
on before
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
but i've been on a my questions coming
 
06:19:04.628 --> 06:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
right up i've been on a school board and
 
06:19:04.638 --> 06:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
right up i've been on a school board and
i

06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
i see scenarios looking at this language
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
that scare me and they maybe would never
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
happen and you and i'm hearing that you
 
06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
know trust you and that you'll do a good
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
job line 11 the last part of line 11
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
line 11 says the child's resident
 
06:19:20.958 --> 06:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
line 11 says the child's resident
district

06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
shall continue to have financial
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the full cost of the
 
06:19:26.718 --> 06:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the full cost of the
services

06:19:28.070 --> 06:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
and if this becomes statute and nothing
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
against attorneys most attorneys are
 
06:19:32.320 --> 06:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
against attorneys most attorneys are
wonderful

06:19:33.270 --> 06:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
06:19:36.468 --> 06:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
they do their job and if if a parent
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
or a school contracts with whomever
 
06:19:42.548 --> 06:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
and this
 
06:19:45.190 --> 06:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
probably will happen there'll be a very
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
you i've seen it there's going to be
 
06:19:46.718 --> 06:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
you i've seen it there's going to be
some

06:19:47.830 --> 06:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
huge classes some school districts
 
06:19:52.788 --> 06:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh will be hard pressed
 
06:19:54.310 --> 06:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the local public school district
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
district will be higher priced to
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
support that but if this goes into law
 
06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the attorneys for whatever family
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
will say this is the statute the full
 
06:20:05.590 --> 06:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
cost of the services in some districts
 
06:20:08.788 --> 06:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
can you reassure us that that uh we're
 
06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
not we would not be making a mistake i
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
know we're pepper i'm peppering you but
 
06:20:13.830 --> 06:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's our job
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
so uh could could you speak to that yeah
 
06:20:17.590 --> 06:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so much for the
 
06:20:18.948 --> 06:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
question i think it's a great question
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
it's the one that's on everybody's mind
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and this bill was intended to
 
06:20:27.510 --> 06:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
be that jolt that is not intended to say
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
here's going to be a charter school
 
06:20:30.628 --> 06:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
hiring a bunch of experts at crazy
 
06:20:32.230 --> 06:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
prices that's not what the bills
 
06:20:34.230 --> 06:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
intended to do what the bills intended
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
to do is to say school district
 
06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
choose one of the five ways in the
 
06:20:40.468 --> 06:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
statute that you can provide education
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
and do it
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
not later not two weeks from now not
 
06:20:47.830 --> 06:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
some other time you control the iep you
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
got five different ways to deliver the
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
service pick one and do it
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
now how do you get how do you convince
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
somebody to to follow the law you have a
 
06:20:59.990 --> 06:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
consequence that's really unpleasant
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
they lose control over it they don't
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
like to lose control over it
 
06:21:06.628 --> 06:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
now is there some thousand dollar an
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
hour occupational therapist or special
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
ed teacher honestly no that's the second
 
06:21:11.910 --> 06:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
part of the answer you talked about
 
06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.670 --> 06:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
here's the deal every contract every
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
agreement every obligation that anybody
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
has as an obligation to act in good
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
faith and if i went into a courtroom and
 
06:21:25.350 --> 06:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
i said your honor you should make so and
 
06:21:27.750 --> 06:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
so school district pay me fifty thousand
 
06:21:30.788 --> 06:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
dollars for a paraprofessional for you
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
know 20 minutes three times a week um i
 
06:21:36.230 --> 06:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't in good faith uh make that
 
06:21:38.628 --> 06:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
argument and i am promise you the judge
 
06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give me the money and so
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
you know those kinds of things are going
 
06:21:44.548 --> 06:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
to sort themselves out in the market
 
06:21:46.788 --> 06:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
will somebody pay 30 an hour for a
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional instead of 25
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
because that's what it took to pull some
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
retired person off the bench and get
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
them back into the school you bet
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
and if that's the extra five dollars is
 
06:21:58.708 --> 06:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
the consequence of this bill
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
uh money well spent
 
06:22:02.310 --> 06:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
money well spent
 
06:22:02.320 --> 06:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
money well spent
um

06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:03.360 --> 06:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:22:05.590 --> 06:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:07.750 --> 06:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
best i could do for your answer
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:22:14.868 --> 06:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i've got another bill
 
06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
before you today but if it's if i don't
 
06:22:19.990 --> 06:22:20.000 align:start position:0%

well we'll find out
 
06:22:22.000 --> 06:22:23.190 align:start position:0%
well we'll find out

rebecca

rebecca
 
06:22:33.990 --> 06:22:34.000 align:start position:0%

06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%

okay why don't you come forward then
please

06:22:46.948 --> 06:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:48.150 --> 06:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman lead
 
06:22:52.230 --> 06:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the committee for allowing me to
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
speak today um there were a few things
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to address regarding
 
06:22:57.510 --> 06:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are some within the bill there are
 
06:23:01.830 --> 06:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
some phrases that are not defined within
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
state or federal law when we talk about
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
a special education plan there is no um
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
a definition of a special education plan
 
06:23:11.030 --> 06:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
it would be an individualized education
 
06:23:11.040 --> 06:23:12.628 align:start position:0%
it would be an individualized education
program

06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:23:14.788 --> 06:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
the second piece would be where
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill speaks to services needed while
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
special education it provides for a
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
child with a disability is entitled to
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the services set forth in their iep it
 
06:23:27.910 --> 06:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
is unclear what is meant by services
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
needed is that the charter school
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
determining what services would be
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
needed or is it are we stating that they
 
06:23:36.708 --> 06:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
would be following the iep
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that those ieps are developed not
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
just by the school district but by the
 
06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
iep team which includes the parent so
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
that is a collaboration between the the
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
parent the student's parent and the
 
06:23:49.270 --> 06:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
district to say this is what we have
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
determined the child needs from the
 
06:23:52.708 --> 06:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
evaluations that were
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
completed on the child it is not the
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
completed on the child it is not the
district

06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:23:57.190 --> 06:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
creating this and then dictating how it
 
06:23:59.190 --> 06:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be provided it is developed with
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
the parents and as part of that team
 
06:24:04.628 --> 06:24:04.638 align:start position:0%
so without clarity for that language it
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
could be inconsistent and potentially
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
conflict with the special education
 
06:24:10.070 --> 06:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
process as defined in the state and
 
06:24:11.590 --> 06:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
a few other things when we talk about
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
the pro
 
06:24:18.468 --> 06:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
all districts have to go through a
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
procurement process i hate that word i'm
 
06:24:20.718 --> 06:24:22.150 align:start position:0%
procurement process i hate that word i'm
sorry

06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through the procurement
 
06:24:25.270 --> 06:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
process if they are using federal funds
 
06:24:27.430 --> 06:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for any of these services so if a
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
district has decided that to pay for the
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
speech and language services that we're
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
providing at these charter schools i
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
need to use my federal funds
 
06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a bill that is over ten
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they need to go through
 
06:24:42.150 --> 06:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
pro procurement processes that we have
 
06:24:44.310 --> 06:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
to approve and say yes you can spend
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
your federal funds on these dollars if
 
06:24:48.868 --> 06:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
this bill were to be approved
 
06:24:50.390 --> 06:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
they would not be getting that approved
 
06:24:51.750 --> 06:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
through us it would be going through it
 
06:24:53.670 --> 06:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be outside of special education
 
06:24:55.430 --> 06:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
law both state and federal where we
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be providing authority to the
 
06:24:59.430 --> 06:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
charter school to expend potentially
 
06:25:01.670 --> 06:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds on something that they do
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to spend those
 
06:25:06.150 --> 06:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds on so districts have to be
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
able to get that approval from us for
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:11.840 --> 06:25:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:25:13.510 --> 06:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then it has been addressed a couple
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
of times and while i know that
 
06:25:19.270 --> 06:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools would do every effort to
 
06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that they get the people that
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
are licensed and certified in the
 
06:25:25.190 --> 06:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
correct areas they have no no um
 
06:25:26.788 --> 06:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
authority to say that they have to do
 
06:25:28.468 --> 06:25:28.478 align:start position:0%
that their rules are very different than
 
06:25:29.910 --> 06:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
our than
 
06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
regular public schools so they could be
 
06:25:33.590 --> 06:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that does not have the correct
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
credentials providing a service it could
 
06:25:37.110 --> 06:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
be somebody who has an elementary
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
education degree providing special
 
06:25:40.708 --> 06:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
education services which we would not
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
allow a regular public school to do so
 
06:25:45.430 --> 06:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
just the concerns with that as they've
 
06:25:47.430 --> 06:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
already been raised
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
as um and i just want to say i testified
 
06:25:53.110 --> 06:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday regarding senate bill 238
 
06:25:56.150 --> 06:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
which is the mou and this bill and then
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill 1141 and then 1014 which we heard
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
this morning all of these might be
 
06:26:02.788 --> 06:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
cleared up with
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
developing a memorandum understanding
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
this would provide for districts and
 
06:26:10.150 --> 06:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools to meet ahead of time to
 
06:26:12.070 --> 06:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
discuss all of these pieces and come to
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
an understanding of who's going to get
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
the speech and language pathologist how
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
is it going to be paid for how are all
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
of these things going to be cleared up
 
06:26:20.948 --> 06:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
so that when you get to that point
 
06:26:22.310 --> 06:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're not saying the child isn't
 
06:26:22.320 --> 06:26:24.830 align:start position:0%
you're not saying the child isn't
getting

06:26:24.830 --> 06:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:27.510 --> 06:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
services and and i do have to say i talk
 
06:26:27.520 --> 06:26:28.548 align:start position:0%
services and and i do have to say i talk
with

06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:26:30.948 --> 06:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
um miss bergeron's group on a regular
 
06:26:32.948 --> 06:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
basis i talk with other directors on a
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
regular basis this is not a purposeful
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
denial of services for those children in
 
06:26:39.750 --> 06:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
charter schools it's not a purposeful
 
06:26:41.830 --> 06:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
denial of services in regular schools
 
06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
right now everyone is having a hard time
 
06:26:46.868 --> 06:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
finding staff to provide these services
 
06:26:49.110 --> 06:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
so i i just want us to keep that in mind
 
06:26:50.868 --> 06:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
as we look at this i want every child to
 
06:26:52.868 --> 06:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
get every service they need but i also
 
06:26:55.110 --> 06:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
understand that in in regular public
 
06:26:56.708 --> 06:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
schools this is also an issue at the
 
06:26:58.468 --> 06:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
same time representative ellison had
 
06:27:00.548 --> 06:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
said is is this something that would
 
06:27:02.548 --> 06:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
provide a different standard for
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
chartered school students yes it would
 
06:27:06.868 --> 06:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
because there are times when a regular
 
06:27:09.110 --> 06:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
public student is not getting the
 
06:27:10.708 --> 06:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
services they need because they can't
 
06:27:12.548 --> 06:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
find somebody so this would give a
 
06:27:14.150 --> 06:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
different standard to charter school
 
06:27:17.190 --> 06:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
students by providing this language
 
06:27:19.270 --> 06:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
so while not lit directly related it was
 
06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
parents still have the right to file a
 
06:27:24.788 --> 06:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
complaint not necessarily a due process
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
hearing but they have the right to file
 
06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
a complaint if their child is not
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
receiving services they would call the
 
06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
doe they would speak with natasha
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
lupiani and again i will go back to she
 
06:27:35.110 --> 06:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
will reach out to the district but they
 
06:27:36.868 --> 06:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
can file that complaint because they are
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
not receiving services and they could be
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
awarded compensatory services for the
 
06:27:42.868 --> 06:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
services they have not received that
 
06:27:44.468 --> 06:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
does not change when they become a
 
06:27:46.230 --> 06:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
charter school student they still have
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:54.868 --> 06:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative boom
 
06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
thank you miss jim thank you for taking
 
06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
the question in normal
 
06:28:00.548 --> 06:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances with the local school
 
06:28:04.230 --> 06:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
district is there any time limit that
 
06:28:06.628 --> 06:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
they have to start providing services as
 
06:28:09.590 --> 06:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
this says two weeks
 
06:28:10.868 --> 06:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
they are saying two weeks we don't have
 
06:28:11.990 --> 06:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
a time limit but it has to be a
 
06:28:13.590 --> 06:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort you have to show that
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
you've been trying if
 
06:28:18.070 --> 06:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
so if as a scenario if a
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
parent called and said my child hasn't
 
06:28:21.510 --> 06:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
had services for three months we would
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
say to the district show us that you
 
06:28:25.190 --> 06:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
have been trying to fulfill this role
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
show us what you've done to try to fill
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
this role have you even tried to fill
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
this role have you even tried to provide
 
06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
these services those are questions that
 
06:28:33.750 --> 06:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
we ask so you have to show that you're
 
06:28:35.190 --> 06:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
providing reasonable effort if the
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
district has done nothing then yes it's
 
06:28:39.190 --> 06:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
so follow up so two weeks is not a
 
06:28:44.948 --> 06:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable it right now i mean i would
 
06:28:46.628 --> 06:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
have to ask districts to clarify but
 
06:28:48.070 --> 06:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
from what i'm hearing no it is not
 
06:28:48.080 --> 06:28:50.468 align:start position:0%
from what i'm hearing no it is not
reasonable

06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
06:28:52.948 --> 06:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
uh i i'd like to just ask you a couple
 
06:28:56.788 --> 06:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
questions regarding services needed
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
if in fact you have a student that
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
transfers in and the parent comes in and
 
06:29:02.868 --> 06:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
says the iep says i'm going to have
 
06:29:04.548 --> 06:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists
 
06:29:06.548 --> 06:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
in other words person with overseas
 
06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
delivering speech to my child
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the iep three times
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
per week and of course the district that
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
is short-handed yes there may be a
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist but the speech
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
pathologist has
 
06:29:23.830 --> 06:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh meets with that child maybe several
 
06:29:23.840 --> 06:29:24.788 align:start position:0%
uh meets with that child maybe several
times

06:29:24.788 --> 06:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:29:27.190 --> 06:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh during the course of maybe uh four
 
06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
weeks but has a para delivering the
 
06:29:31.910 --> 06:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
service or the plan
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
um within the
 
06:29:36.310 --> 06:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
to identify maybe those articulation or
 
06:29:38.230 --> 06:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
whatever we're dealing with
 
06:29:39.990 --> 06:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that would that be permissible in
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
other words we're delivering a service
 
06:29:44.310 --> 06:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
what the are we meeting the need that's
 
06:29:46.708 --> 06:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
kind of subjective um
 
06:29:48.708 --> 06:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
so how would that some a scenario like
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
this be treated
 
06:29:51.830 --> 06:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
not providing the same service a parent
 
06:29:53.750 --> 06:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
wants right so it would depend on what
 
06:29:55.990 --> 06:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon within the iep if they
 
06:29:58.390 --> 06:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
in within the iep we list um who
 
06:30:00.310 --> 06:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
oversees the service and then who
 
06:30:02.868 --> 06:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
provides the service so if if within the
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
iep it says that a speech pathologist is
 
06:30:07.110 --> 06:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to provide the service then the
 
06:30:08.948 --> 06:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
district has not met what was agreed
 
06:30:10.948 --> 06:30:10.958 align:start position:0%
upon with the in the iep
 
06:30:13.670 --> 06:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
if it says that the speech pathologist
 
06:30:15.990 --> 06:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
was going to oversee a speech assistant
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
providing the service then then yes the
 
06:30:19.750 --> 06:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
need would have been met but you would
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
also look at whether the student
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
continued to make progress you would
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
look at whether the that the district
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
made their best effort to provide what
 
06:30:28.948 --> 06:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
they could
 
06:30:31.110 --> 06:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
and and what that looks like at the end
 
06:30:33.270 --> 06:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
of it it's always about progress and
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
progress towards their goals so while we
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
might say to them you you know you
 
06:30:38.468 --> 06:30:38.478 align:start position:0%
should have talked with the parents and
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
said that you couldn't provide a speech
 
06:30:42.390 --> 06:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
pathologist and would they agree to a
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
speech assistant they did do their best
 
06:30:46.468 --> 06:30:46.478 align:start position:0%
effort to provide services to that child
 
06:30:48.150 --> 06:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
so they were receiving services and not
 
06:30:49.430 --> 06:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
receiving nothing
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:30:52.548 --> 06:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes represent luna
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and thanks
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
very much for joining us this afternoon
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
providing some clarification on this do
 
06:31:01.990 --> 06:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
um in your experience do districts do
 
06:31:06.868 --> 06:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
pay for i guess compensatory services
 
06:31:12.310 --> 06:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
so t so typically i would say yes they
 
06:31:13.990 --> 06:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
do everything they can to
 
06:31:16.548 --> 06:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
avoid paying for compensatory services
 
06:31:18.150 --> 06:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
however currently i know that there are
 
06:31:19.590 --> 06:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
many districts who when they are not
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
able to provide services right now
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
because they're having difficulty they
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
are actually tracking services and
 
06:31:26.788 --> 06:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
voluntarily providing compensatory
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
services because they know they have not
 
06:31:30.310 --> 06:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
met the need but they are having those
 
06:31:31.990 --> 06:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with parents and saying yes
 
06:31:34.310 --> 06:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're saying that your child needs three
 
06:31:36.390 --> 06:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
services a week for special education
 
06:31:38.230 --> 06:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
however i can only do two right now
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to track how many we're
 
06:31:40.948 --> 06:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
missing with you and we're going to come
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
back to you and look at what the
 
06:31:44.150 --> 06:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
compensatory services might look like
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
later on
 
06:31:48.628 --> 06:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
great thanks so it's so that sounds like
 
06:31:48.638 --> 06:31:50.230 align:start position:0%
great thanks so it's so that sounds like
a

06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:31:52.230 --> 06:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
working in cooperation with these and
 
06:31:53.750 --> 06:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's not typically what happens but

06:36:17.990 --> 06:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
just a very basic question the ownership
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
of this building that might be built in
 
06:36:22.070 --> 06:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
such a way would it rest with the school
 
06:36:24.708 --> 06:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
or would it rest with the community
 
06:36:28.468 --> 06:36:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the
 
06:36:30.240 --> 06:36:31.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the
building

06:36:31.350 --> 06:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:36:34.150 --> 06:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
being the chartered school building
 
06:36:36.548 --> 06:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
that could vary
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
for example there are charter schools
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.110 --> 06:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much thank you
 
06:36:53.030 --> 06:36:53.040 align:start position:0%

06:36:55.990 --> 06:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
like to first ask amy clark is amy oh
 
06:37:01.990 --> 06:37:02.000 align:start position:0%

06:37:24.230 --> 06:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
mike is your mic on there we go uh for
 
06:37:25.990 --> 06:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
the record my name is amy clark and i'm
 
06:37:27.910 --> 06:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
with the department of education i am
 
06:37:29.670 --> 06:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the school safety
 
06:37:32.230 --> 06:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
and facility management program and i
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the building aid program falls under
 
06:37:34.000 --> 06:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
the building aid program falls under
that

06:37:35.030 --> 06:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm here happy to answer any of your
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions if i can
 
06:37:40.948 --> 06:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
okay the first one i would have in
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
regard to the 30 to 60 percent of the
 
06:37:47.830 --> 06:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:50.150 --> 06:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
does that parallel what we currently
 
06:37:53.430 --> 06:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
have in law for the all public schools
 
06:37:54.628 --> 06:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
or districts
 
06:37:56.150 --> 06:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh so you're talking about the building
 
06:37:58.150 --> 06:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
aid rate yes is that correct so
 
06:38:00.390 --> 06:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
06:38:02.070 --> 06:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative mooney pointed out a very
 
06:38:04.468 --> 06:38:04.478 align:start position:0%
good point in this bill is to note is
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
that building aid
 
06:38:09.590 --> 06:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's not building aid that prohibits uh
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools from receiving building
 
06:38:14.230 --> 06:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
aid it's that repeal that really that
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
last line in this bill
 
06:38:19.590 --> 06:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
so in the current building aid law is
 
06:38:22.230 --> 06:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
the rate of thirty to sixty percent for
 
06:38:24.150 --> 06:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
public school districts and charter
 
06:38:26.708 --> 06:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
schools qualify for thirty percent so
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
again charter schools qualify for thirty
 
06:38:31.430 --> 06:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
percent building aid but there's a
 
06:38:34.070 --> 06:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
separate part of the law in rsa 194 that
 
06:38:36.390 --> 06:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from applying to building
 
06:38:36.400 --> 06:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from applying to building
aid

06:38:37.190 --> 06:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
aid
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
so just keep that in mind but they quote
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
that currently building aid is 30 for
 
06:38:44.070 --> 06:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools district public schools
 
06:38:47.670 --> 06:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 depending on two factors which
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
is median family income and equalized
 
06:38:51.910 --> 06:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil yes i'm familiar
 
06:38:53.350 --> 06:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:38:55.670 --> 06:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
very much so uh so then the question i
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
have is that once we release those
 
06:39:00.070 --> 06:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
applicants that have been approved let's
 
06:39:02.150 --> 06:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
say on january 15th and that we're
 
06:39:03.990 --> 06:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go into
 
06:39:06.390 --> 06:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of dollars from the
 
06:39:07.590 --> 06:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
town to
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
facilitate this percentage in all
 
06:39:12.390 --> 06:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
districts you know let's say the medium
 
06:39:14.830 --> 06:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
is around 40 percent
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
um the other 60 it's incumbent upon the
 
06:39:20.788 --> 06:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:39:22.788 --> 06:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh the the people that are going to
 
06:39:24.390 --> 06:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
raise the money locally in the town
 
06:39:26.468 --> 06:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
there and with the understanding that
 
06:39:29.430 --> 06:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
the project will uh provide 80 up front
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
and twenty percent
 
06:39:33.430 --> 06:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh upon completion
 
06:39:35.430 --> 06:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i i'm just imagining it's the same
 
06:39:38.230 --> 06:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
way in this uh it is correct what do you
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
mean for charter schools for charter
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
schools correct
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
so they would come up with the seventy
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
percent local locally meaning the
 
06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
charter school so
 
06:39:49.830 --> 06:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
where does the charter school go to get
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
the authorization to raise the money for
 
06:39:55.830 --> 06:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
the the other part locally from their
 
06:39:57.670 --> 06:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
whom other words
 
06:40:00.150 --> 06:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
we have to raise that at town meeting to
 
06:40:03.190 --> 06:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know facilitate the whole thing here
 
06:40:05.430 --> 06:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
plus what we're getting from the state
 
06:40:07.990 --> 06:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
where does the uh charter school come up
 
06:40:09.670 --> 06:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
with the type of dollar that's necessary
 
06:40:11.270 --> 06:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
for some of these you know expansion
 
06:40:13.590 --> 06:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
projects yeah that's a good question i
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
would have to defer to others um how the
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
charter schools would generate their
 
06:40:19.030 --> 06:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
money it's just not the state wouldn't
 
06:40:20.948 --> 06:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
be generating any of it like currently
 
06:40:23.110 --> 06:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
right now they have to generate 100 of
 
06:40:25.590 --> 06:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
it but how they do that
 
06:40:27.830 --> 06:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
i would defer to others behind me that
 
06:40:29.430 --> 06:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
could speak to how charter schools would
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
pay for their current construction
 
06:40:33.430 --> 06:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
project okay thank you other other
 
06:40:33.440 --> 06:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
project okay thank you other other
questions

06:40:35.430 --> 06:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:40:37.990 --> 06:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the department for me
 
06:40:40.548 --> 06:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
oh represent porter
 
06:40:42.628 --> 06:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you this is
 
06:40:44.868 --> 06:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
something i know very little about so
 
06:40:47.190 --> 06:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
another under the current situations
 
06:40:48.628 --> 06:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
public um local community public schools
 
06:40:54.390 --> 06:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
own their property it belongs to the
 
06:40:54.400 --> 06:40:56.468 align:start position:0%
own their property it belongs to the
town

06:40:56.468 --> 06:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
town
 
06:40:56.478 --> 06:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
town
most

06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
most
 
06:40:59.910 --> 06:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that many if not
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
most charter schools do not own their
 
06:41:03.910 --> 06:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
own property
 
06:41:03.920 --> 06:41:05.670 align:start position:0%
own property
so

06:41:05.670 --> 06:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:41:08.948 --> 06:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i'm wondering how
 
06:41:10.548 --> 06:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
someone who doesn't own their own
 
06:41:11.990 --> 06:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
property could
 
06:41:15.750 --> 06:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
make capital improvements upon it
 
06:41:17.750 --> 06:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
using this money if they don't own it to
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
begin with it's like when you rent an
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
apartment you can paint the walls but
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
you know put get a hundred thousand
 
06:41:26.390 --> 06:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
dollar loan to renovate your kitchen and
 
06:41:28.390 --> 06:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
then move out so i'm wondering how that
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
would work for a charter school that
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
does not own its own building
 
06:41:34.868 --> 06:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
sure um it's a good point um thank you
 
06:41:37.110 --> 06:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
for that question there are two pieces
 
06:41:39.270 --> 06:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
in building aid one is
 
06:41:41.110 --> 06:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
called building aid and it's for the
 
06:41:43.110 --> 06:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
construction of a property that they
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
would own so this would not pertain to
 
06:41:47.670 --> 06:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools that lease their
 
06:41:49.590 --> 06:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
buildings it would be to specifically
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're right not very common but there
 
06:41:53.350 --> 06:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
are some charter schools that are
 
06:41:55.110 --> 06:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
growing that are more well established
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
that are looking for a place to purchase
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
um and we have some of those that have
 
06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
purchased there is another arm of
 
06:42:03.030 --> 06:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
building aid called lease aid which
 
06:42:05.910 --> 06:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools are eligible for um and
 
06:42:08.548 --> 06:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
that is for when they are in a lease
 
06:42:08.558 --> 06:42:11.110 align:start position:0%
that is for when they are in a lease
agreement

06:42:11.110 --> 06:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:12.548 --> 06:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
how would this bill
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
work for them so for the lease it
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact they're two separate
 
06:42:18.390 --> 06:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
programs so a charter school that leases
 
06:42:20.310 --> 06:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
would apply for lease aid because they
 
06:42:22.468 --> 06:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
can currently under the current law and
 
06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
a charter school that owns their own
 
06:42:23.760 --> 06:42:24.708 align:start position:0%
a charter school that owns their own
building

06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:42:25.990 --> 06:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
can't apply for lease aid because they
 
06:42:27.830 --> 06:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't own it but they also can't apply
 
06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
for building aid because the law
 
06:42:30.230 --> 06:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from applying for
 
06:42:32.310 --> 06:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
building thank you
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
06:42:35.830 --> 06:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chair and thank you
 
06:42:37.110 --> 06:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and i want to
 
06:42:39.270 --> 06:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative porter's uh
 
06:42:39.280 --> 06:42:40.230 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative porter's uh
question

06:42:40.230 --> 06:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:42:43.190 --> 06:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
um i've received a message from
 
06:42:45.110 --> 06:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone who's fairly familiar with this
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
area and he says there's approximately
 
06:42:48.000 --> 06:42:48.868 align:start position:0%
area and he says there's approximately
one

06:42:48.868 --> 06:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:42:51.350 --> 06:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
charter school that owns its own
 
06:42:53.910 --> 06:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
property i don't know but to follow up
 
06:42:55.350 --> 06:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
on representative porter's question if
 
06:42:57.990 --> 06:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's only approximately one
 
06:42:59.350 --> 06:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
charter school that owns its own
 
06:43:01.270 --> 06:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
building um
 
06:43:03.590 --> 06:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
it would seem that this measure
 
06:43:05.990 --> 06:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
would would almost be moot do you know
 
06:43:07.990 --> 06:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
if that's true there's only one one i
 
06:43:09.750 --> 06:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's true but you might not
 
06:43:12.390 --> 06:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
be too far off i think the number is low
 
06:43:14.868 --> 06:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
but as charter schools grow and as they
 
06:43:17.670 --> 06:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot longer longevity they may be
 
06:43:21.030 --> 06:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
looking to purchase so um but i would
 
06:43:22.390 --> 06:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
say that
 
06:43:24.628 --> 06:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that this bill doesn't
 
06:43:27.430 --> 06:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of building aid it
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
just allows charter schools to be an
 
06:43:32.070 --> 06:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
eligible applicant
 
06:43:34.390 --> 06:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
to building aid so whether it be one
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
charter school two charter schools that
 
06:43:39.510 --> 06:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
apply over the course of many years
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
it will
 
06:43:42.230 --> 06:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
it will matter to that particular
 
06:43:43.990 --> 06:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
charter school because they'll be able
 
06:43:46.548 --> 06:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
to be eligible to apply for building aid
 
06:43:48.948 --> 06:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't increase the amount
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the grant that's available just it's
 
06:43:52.868 --> 06:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
a competitive grant
 
06:43:54.150 --> 06:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
so let me
 
06:43:56.548 --> 06:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
just clarify that building aid is capped
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
at a certain amount of money and
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
way more projects we have than the
 
06:44:05.110 --> 06:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money for example i have maybe
 
06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what the budget is i could
 
06:44:09.830 --> 06:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
potentially have 40 million dollars
 
06:44:11.830 --> 06:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
for building aid i already have
 
06:44:15.030 --> 06:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
applications over 260 million dollars of
 
06:44:16.948 --> 06:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
those charter schools would just be one
 
06:44:19.350 --> 06:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
of those eligible people that are
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
seeking that 40 a piece of that 40
 
06:44:21.920 --> 06:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
seeking that 40 a piece of that 40
million

06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:44:24.548 --> 06:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
i see and that speaks to the recall
 
06:44:26.948 --> 06:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
provision at the very end um
 
06:44:29.190 --> 06:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned yes you said a low
 
06:44:31.590 --> 06:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
number i said approximately one so
 
06:44:33.750 --> 06:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
gave me a little wiggle room right right
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
for further questions yes representative
 
06:44:38.558 --> 06:44:39.590 align:start position:0%
for further questions yes representative

06:44:39.590 --> 06:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
cornell
 
06:44:41.190 --> 06:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:44:43.270 --> 06:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
question i'm a little confused if if
 
06:44:44.948 --> 06:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
they apply for the building aid it's for
 
06:44:47.590 --> 06:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
a building they already own to improve
 
06:44:49.350 --> 06:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
or or
 
06:44:49.360 --> 06:44:50.548 align:start position:0%
or or
um

06:44:50.548 --> 06:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:53.190 --> 06:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know make bigger it's not to build
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
new construction or is it um both so um
 
06:44:59.430 --> 06:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's a capital improvement so a common
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
building aid project um there's really
 
06:45:04.708 --> 06:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
five of them would be to build a brand
 
06:45:07.910 --> 06:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
new building to substantially renovate a
 
06:45:09.510 --> 06:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
building again these are buildings they
 
06:45:12.070 --> 06:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
own substantial renovation putting on an
 
06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
addition to a building
 
06:45:14.638 --> 06:45:16.390 align:start position:0%
addition to a building
purchasing

06:45:16.390 --> 06:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
06:45:19.590 --> 06:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
energy efficient equipment that helps
 
06:45:21.910 --> 06:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
a building and
 
06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing land those are the eligible
 
06:45:26.230 --> 06:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
things so you couldn't building it is
 
06:45:28.868 --> 06:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
not for small projects
 
06:45:30.548 --> 06:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
not even a small renovation you couldn't
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
apply for building aid if you wanted to
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
redo this room and do the carpet and the
 
06:45:37.190 --> 06:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
walls that's not a building aid project
 
06:45:39.270 --> 06:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
however if you wanted to gut the things
 
06:45:42.070 --> 06:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
down to the studs and rework the walls
 
06:45:45.430 --> 06:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a building aid project
 
06:45:47.110 --> 06:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent luna
 
06:45:48.548 --> 06:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sharon thank you
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
very much ms clark for joining us this
 
06:45:52.070 --> 06:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon um
 
06:45:55.110 --> 06:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
does the department um uh
 
06:45:58.788 --> 06:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
track the uh the condition and quality
 
06:46:00.390 --> 06:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
06:46:01.990 --> 06:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
buildings that are currently occupied by
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
06:46:06.230 --> 06:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh we don't uh probably along the same
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
line well let me just clarify that we
 
06:46:10.310 --> 06:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't in the sense of we don't for
 
06:46:11.910 --> 06:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
district public school local district
 
06:46:16.468 --> 06:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
schools either um so we as a
 
06:46:17.830 --> 06:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
school approval
 
06:46:17.840 --> 06:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
school approval
um

06:46:19.510 --> 06:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:21.670 --> 06:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
so there's a school approval process at
 
06:46:23.910 --> 06:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
the department of education that the
 
06:46:26.868 --> 06:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
department reviews 20
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:46:31.030 --> 06:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
local district schools every year and
 
06:46:33.590 --> 06:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
therefore it's a five-year cycle 20 five
 
06:46:35.030 --> 06:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
years it gets so that the department of
 
06:46:37.030 --> 06:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
education is reviewing a school's
 
06:46:37.040 --> 06:46:38.150 align:start position:0%
education is reviewing a school's
facility

06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:46:40.230 --> 06:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
as a school inspection so do they have
 
06:46:41.590 --> 06:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
their fire inspection report do they
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
have the health inspection report is
 
06:46:45.190 --> 06:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
there mold is there are there science
 
06:46:47.350 --> 06:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
their chemicals being properly labeled
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
06:46:50.548 --> 06:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
type of review happens for the local
 
06:46:53.270 --> 06:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
district schools it also happens for the
 
06:46:54.788 --> 06:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
charter schools it's just under a
 
06:46:56.548 --> 06:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
different arm because we follow the
 
06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
renewal schedule for the charter schools
 
06:47:02.708 --> 06:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
rather than 20 every year
 
06:47:04.868 --> 06:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
but it's not a facility condition
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
assessment of charter schools or local
 
06:47:10.230 --> 06:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
so it's not like the 3.3 million dollars
 
06:47:15.190 --> 06:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to seek correct it's not
 
06:47:17.190 --> 06:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's no facility condition index
 
06:47:19.030 --> 06:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's no educational sufficiency
 
06:47:21.510 --> 06:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
standard we don't have a rank um we
 
06:47:23.750 --> 06:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a big planning document that
 
06:47:25.350 --> 06:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
says these are the top schools that we
 
06:47:27.030 --> 06:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
need to target
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
okay which would be great other
 
06:47:29.830 --> 06:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
06:47:29.840 --> 06:47:32.468 align:start position:0%
questions from
tanner

06:47:32.468 --> 06:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there uh federal funds and
 
06:47:37.670 --> 06:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
available for charter schools for
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh so currently there are no there's the
 
06:47:45.670 --> 06:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
sr funds and arp funds uh american
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
rescue yeah arp uh funds they're not
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
through my program so i'm not
 
06:47:52.150 --> 06:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable answering those questions
 
06:47:54.070 --> 06:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
but those are the covered like just in
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
general those are the covid relief funds
 
06:47:57.990 --> 06:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
and they're through a different division
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
at the department of education um those
 
06:48:03.990 --> 06:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
but if you're talking about just general
 
06:48:05.990 --> 06:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds other than the coveted
 
06:48:08.070 --> 06:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
relief funds there are no federal funds
 
06:48:08.080 --> 06:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
relief funds there are no federal funds
available

06:48:10.070 --> 06:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:48:10.080 --> 06:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
available
yes

06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:48:14.070 --> 06:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i i thought that the uh charter
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
schools that there was a large grant
 
06:48:17.590 --> 06:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:48:19.030 --> 06:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if that can be
 
06:48:21.910 --> 06:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
used for building aid uh yeah i believe
 
06:48:23.430 --> 06:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
um nate greene is here from the
 
06:48:24.628 --> 06:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
department of education there's a
 
06:48:26.948 --> 06:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
startup um grant for charter schools and
 
06:48:28.468 --> 06:48:28.478 align:start position:0%
he's the expert on that so he could
 
06:48:30.468 --> 06:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
answer those questions if you'd like me
 
06:48:30.478 --> 06:48:31.350 align:start position:0%
answer those questions if you'd like me
to

06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:48:35.110 --> 06:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
would you like date green to come up
 
06:48:37.030 --> 06:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
nate can come up and while he's coming
 
06:48:38.628 --> 06:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
up i got a question though to ask you
 
06:48:40.708 --> 06:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
regarding a little bit of this
 
06:48:40.718 --> 06:48:42.150 align:start position:0%
regarding a little bit of this
um

06:48:42.150 --> 06:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
when we provide these grants to schools
 
06:48:47.350 --> 06:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's a condition that comes down with
 
06:48:50.390 --> 06:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
it if you walk away from this school in
 
06:48:53.190 --> 06:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
a period of time what 20 years
 
06:48:55.350 --> 06:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
you have to pay back the whole loan that
 
06:48:57.510 --> 06:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
you receive from the state
 
06:48:59.990 --> 06:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
would this be applicable to this
 
06:49:02.548 --> 06:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
particular type of grant and
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
what what kind of assurance are you
 
06:49:06.708 --> 06:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to have that the longevity or the
 
06:49:09.190 --> 06:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
bonding power or the dollar that they
 
06:49:10.868 --> 06:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
have will be able to do what we're
 
06:49:13.270 --> 06:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
expecting as a state to recoup the
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollar we put into it yeah those are
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
very good questions i'd say there's two
 
06:49:19.430 --> 06:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
um two things that i think that you
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
should take a careful look at this bill
 
06:49:23.430 --> 06:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
again the department of education didn't
 
06:49:23.440 --> 06:49:24.628 align:start position:0%
again the department of education didn't
um

06:49:24.628 --> 06:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:26.468 --> 06:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
write this bill but one would be that
 
06:49:28.150 --> 06:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
penalty section
 
06:49:30.548 --> 06:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
that you may want to look at to see
 
06:49:32.150 --> 06:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
if you feel like the state's investment
 
06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
is protected currently it requires a
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
local district school to pay back a
 
06:49:39.590 --> 06:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of their grant if they
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
leave that project within 20 years
 
06:49:45.910 --> 06:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a long-term commitment
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's under the commissioner's discretion
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
how they whether they're going to waive
 
06:49:52.150 --> 06:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
any of that so for example we have had
 
06:49:54.150 --> 06:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
some local district schools close that
 
06:49:55.830 --> 06:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
we cur that have been within that
 
06:49:58.868 --> 06:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
20-year period very few but it typically
 
06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
06:50:01.990 --> 06:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not happening when the first 10
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
years usually it's happening like year
 
06:50:06.150 --> 06:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
18 year 19 and what the department has
 
06:50:09.430 --> 06:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
done in those cases is that we stopped
 
06:50:09.440 --> 06:50:10.948 align:start position:0%
done in those cases is that we stopped
paying

06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:50:12.788 --> 06:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
building aid if you know building aid
 
06:50:14.468 --> 06:50:14.478 align:start position:0%
you might know where i'm going with this
 
06:50:18.070 --> 06:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
but in the old building aid method
 
06:50:19.830 --> 06:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
let me you just give me a nod if i'm
 
06:50:25.030 --> 06:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:27.510 --> 06:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we had a 540 million dollar debt
 
06:50:29.430 --> 06:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
when we started this thing out right and
 
06:50:31.190 --> 06:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're nailing it down and it won't be
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
done until 2049 or some such year right
 
06:50:35.990 --> 06:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
so for those that understand we just on
 
06:50:39.030 --> 06:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
year 18 we stopped paying our 18th year
 
06:50:41.110 --> 06:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
of payment that's how we handled those
 
06:50:42.868 --> 06:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
so that penalty would be one thing that
 
06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider on this bill
 
06:50:47.750 --> 06:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then the other one um is
 
06:50:49.510 --> 06:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
06:50:52.708 --> 06:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
line four through six
 
06:50:52.718 --> 06:50:53.590 align:start position:0%
line four through six
or

06:50:53.590 --> 06:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:50:56.390 --> 06:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
line three through six on page two
 
06:50:58.868 --> 06:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
and that's that percentage you started
 
06:51:00.468 --> 06:51:00.478 align:start position:0%
with that question about how much
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
charter school should be
 
06:51:05.350 --> 06:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
i would just say that the current
 
06:51:07.270 --> 06:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
kind of leaves that on my desk it says
 
06:51:11.350 --> 06:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
i know what that means when it's written
 
06:51:14.788 --> 06:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
in here it leaves that up to me which i
 
06:51:17.510 --> 06:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
i can do that that's fine but what i
 
06:51:20.708 --> 06:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
want to point out is the current law
 
06:51:23.350 --> 06:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
does the formula for local public school
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
districts so to keep that the same it
 
06:51:28.628 --> 06:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
might be a recommendation that you that
 
06:51:30.310 --> 06:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
you all determine
 
06:51:32.230 --> 06:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
what that rate is going to be if you
 
06:51:32.240 --> 06:51:33.350 align:start position:0%
what that rate is going to be if you
decide

06:51:33.350 --> 06:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
decide
 
06:51:35.910 --> 06:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do this right now it says the state
 
06:51:37.430 --> 06:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
board of education shall develop
 
06:51:39.670 --> 06:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
criteria to determine the amount that is
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
closely approximate to what we give
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
local school districts
 
06:51:45.990 --> 06:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
again local school districts formula is
 
06:51:49.270 --> 06:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
current in the in this rsa 195
 
06:51:49.280 --> 06:51:50.948 align:start position:0%
current in the in this rsa 195
198.15

06:51:50.948 --> 06:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
198.15
 
06:51:52.868 --> 06:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
and so it might be appropriate for you
 
06:51:54.788 --> 06:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
all to figure out what that formula is
 
06:51:57.030 --> 06:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
as well yes that's very complex and
 
06:51:58.628 --> 06:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
getting alternative stuff too with the
 
06:52:01.110 --> 06:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
five percent added on and also there's a
 
06:52:03.910 --> 06:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
lot to this it's just not easy to put in
 
06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
in a sentence say we got it correct uh
 
06:52:09.830 --> 06:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
nate green is back up here now can we
 
06:52:11.750 --> 06:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
follow through with the questions to
 
06:52:13.830 --> 06:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
nate here
 
06:52:15.430 --> 06:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
per me
 
06:52:17.750 --> 06:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
i thought there was a question for nate
 
06:52:18.948 --> 06:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
first yes
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
so my question is about the
 
06:52:23.110 --> 06:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
charter school grant that federal grant
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
that was received uh substantial
 
06:52:27.510 --> 06:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
is that going into building aid
 
06:52:33.350 --> 06:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
no so it won't part of the conditions of
 
06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
that particular grant is that it cannot
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
be used for any capital improvements to
 
06:52:39.030 --> 06:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
buildings it can't substantially
 
06:52:41.430 --> 06:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
increase the value of any properties or
 
06:52:43.750 --> 06:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that charter schools own
 
06:52:45.750 --> 06:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
the only building projects that could be
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
undertaken using the federal charter
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
school funds are if a charter school is
 
06:52:50.160 --> 06:52:51.510 align:start position:0%
school funds are if a charter school is
currently

06:52:51.510 --> 06:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:52:53.830 --> 06:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
using a building that is not zoned for
 
06:52:56.070 --> 06:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
an educational use they can utilize
 
06:52:57.910 --> 06:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
those federal funds to make whatever
 
06:53:00.150 --> 06:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
improvements necessary in order to
 
06:53:02.070 --> 06:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
change the zoning requirements and make
 
06:53:04.390 --> 06:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
it appropriate for educational use but
 
06:53:05.670 --> 06:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
anything beyond that would not be
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
allowable with the federal funds
 
06:53:10.708 --> 06:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:12.390 --> 06:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
represent boom did you have a question
 
06:53:12.400 --> 06:53:13.350 align:start position:0%
represent boom did you have a question
yes

06:53:13.350 --> 06:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:53:14.390 --> 06:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:53:16.070 --> 06:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
the question is something like like you
 
06:53:18.150 --> 06:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
started with
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
charter schools get re-licensed i
 
06:53:23.190 --> 06:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
believe every five years or if they go
 
06:53:25.190 --> 06:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
out of business beforehand
 
06:53:28.548 --> 06:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
so if we give a grant for bill to school
 
06:53:31.670 --> 06:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
who owns that school
 
06:53:33.830 --> 06:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
who owns the property it's on in the
 
06:53:33.840 --> 06:53:34.788 align:start position:0%
who owns the property it's on in the
local

06:53:34.788 --> 06:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
local
 
06:53:36.390 --> 06:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
the town does or the school district
 
06:53:38.468 --> 06:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
does with the charter school it can be
 
06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere so if they
 
06:53:43.110 --> 06:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
go out of business or they don't get
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
their license renewed
 
06:53:47.030 --> 06:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
06:53:49.110 --> 06:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i i i'll leave
 
06:53:50.548 --> 06:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
that up for others that know charter
 
06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:55.910 --> 06:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i can speak to that
 
06:53:57.670 --> 06:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
so charter schools are required to have
 
06:53:59.270 --> 06:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
a plan for the dissolution of their
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
assets in the event that the school does
 
06:54:03.270 --> 06:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
close and that plan has to be signed off
 
06:54:05.430 --> 06:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
by the state board of education and so
 
06:54:07.430 --> 06:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
there might be a variety of people that
 
06:54:09.750 --> 06:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be listed as a creditor
 
06:54:11.190 --> 06:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
depending on where the money or the
 
06:54:13.190 --> 06:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
assets has come from to that particular
 
06:54:14.548 --> 06:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
06:54:16.628 --> 06:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
and then anything that is not explicitly
 
06:54:19.190 --> 06:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
spelled out within that dissolution plan
 
06:54:21.110 --> 06:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
those assets revert to the local
 
06:54:22.628 --> 06:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
resident school district where the
 
06:54:27.750 --> 06:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:29.750 --> 06:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead rep san luna so thanks very
 
06:54:32.310 --> 06:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
much mr chair and just a a follow-up on
 
06:54:34.708 --> 06:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative bones excellent question
 
06:54:34.718 --> 06:54:35.590 align:start position:0%
representative bones excellent question
um

06:54:35.590 --> 06:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:37.670 --> 06:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
if um if the local school district
 
06:54:40.150 --> 06:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
assumes the assets do they also resume
 
06:54:43.590 --> 06:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
any risk or liability in terms of
 
06:54:47.910 --> 06:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
the building aid
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
grant dollars if charter school were to
 
06:54:55.510 --> 06:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
exit or go out of business or stop
 
06:54:57.350 --> 06:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
cease operations within the 20-year
 
06:54:58.788 --> 06:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
06:55:00.390 --> 06:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
i would need to check back on that
 
06:55:02.468 --> 06:55:02.478 align:start position:0%
statute but my understanding is that the
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
local school district does not assume
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
any of the liabilities they would just
 
06:55:07.590 --> 06:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
take possession of any assets that have
 
06:55:09.910 --> 06:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
not already been deemed to somebody else
 
06:55:12.070 --> 06:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
through that dissolution plan okay so
 
06:55:14.230 --> 06:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
and follow up on that so so this the the
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
state could end up holding the bag then
 
06:55:16.958 --> 06:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
state could end up holding the bag then
uh

06:55:18.390 --> 06:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:55:19.590 --> 06:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
yes but i would want to check back on
 
06:55:23.670 --> 06:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:25.030 --> 06:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
06:55:27.430 --> 06:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
if i if i may can i just make one other
 
06:55:30.628 --> 06:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
comment i had a little bit of time
 
06:55:30.638 --> 06:55:32.230 align:start position:0%
comment i had a little bit of time
reading

06:55:32.230 --> 06:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
reading
 
06:55:35.030 --> 06:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
i just wanna if um this bill does go
 
06:55:36.948 --> 06:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
through just two things that i would um
 
06:55:39.510 --> 06:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
consider for an amendment one is on
 
06:55:42.390 --> 06:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
line seven this is on page one line
 
06:55:45.110 --> 06:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
seven in line twenty one
 
06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
both reference an rsa
 
06:55:52.070 --> 06:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
um both lines reference rsa 198 15 u
 
06:55:55.430 --> 06:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
through rsa 198 15 w
 
06:55:57.350 --> 06:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
though that is the section that
 
06:56:00.708 --> 06:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
calculates the formula for the local
 
06:56:03.510 --> 06:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
public school districts so if you keep
 
06:56:06.548 --> 06:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
this you'll also want to reference the
 
06:56:09.190 --> 06:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
section that gives the rate to the
 
06:56:12.070 --> 06:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools
 
06:56:14.310 --> 06:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
and is the criteria that we would use
 
06:56:17.190 --> 06:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
for the application to get the 200 some
 
06:56:19.510 --> 06:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
odd points that we have in it right now
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
that would we use the same formula which
 
06:56:23.750 --> 06:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
has safety the demographics of the
 
06:56:26.230 --> 06:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
building all those issues
 
06:56:28.468 --> 06:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
would that be applied to these and would
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
they follow through and
 
06:56:31.910 --> 06:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
have that report also go to school
 
06:56:33.270 --> 06:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
building authority
 
06:56:34.628 --> 06:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
correct they would it would be just
 
06:56:36.390 --> 06:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
making them ineligible they'd follow the
 
06:56:39.110 --> 06:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
exact same process thank you very much
 
06:56:40.310 --> 06:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much to the
 
06:56:42.230 --> 06:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
department uh we do have some more
 
06:56:43.750 --> 06:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
people that testify on this bill but
 
06:56:45.270 --> 06:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that should help us with some of the
 
06:56:47.590 --> 06:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions we might ask others
 
06:56:51.750 --> 06:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:04.310 --> 06:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm just going i'm
 
06:57:05.670 --> 06:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief in the interest
 
06:57:07.270 --> 06:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
of time you've all been very patient
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
today and had lots of questions about
 
06:57:10.150 --> 06:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
06:57:14.150 --> 06:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
i am in support of hv 1499.
 
06:57:17.030 --> 06:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
and any of my other time i'd like to
 
06:57:18.708 --> 06:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
allow other people to come up for public
 
06:57:18.718 --> 06:57:19.750 align:start position:0%
allow other people to come up for public

06:57:22.150 --> 06:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
06:57:24.948 --> 06:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and then the other card we
 
06:57:41.670 --> 06:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:43.350 --> 06:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair member the members of
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to be
 
06:57:46.310 --> 06:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
back again i thought it was done but i
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
miscounted um sorry about that uh very
 
06:57:52.788 --> 06:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
brief comments um i support uh 14.99 i
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
think being able to fund the buildings
 
06:57:55.990 --> 06:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
for charter schools has always been a
 
06:57:57.430 --> 06:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
really complicated puzzle and one of the
 
06:58:00.390 --> 06:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
big barriers to getting them going um
 
06:58:01.990 --> 06:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
06:58:04.230 --> 06:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
them getting lease aid in the past that
 
06:58:06.788 --> 06:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
was certainly a big benefit and
 
06:58:08.230 --> 06:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think that that will continue to be a
 
06:58:10.150 --> 06:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
benefit for the schools but if you ask
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
why should so many charter schools lease
 
06:58:13.590 --> 06:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
their buildings instead of buy their
 
06:58:13.600 --> 06:58:15.270 align:start position:0%
their buildings instead of buy their
buildings

06:58:15.270 --> 06:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
06:58:16.868 --> 06:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that long ago single digit
 
06:58:18.628 --> 06:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
number of years ago
 
06:58:20.150 --> 06:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the law actually prevented charter
 
06:58:22.868 --> 06:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
schools from carrying long-term debt
 
06:58:24.230 --> 06:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't finance anything for
 
06:58:27.670 --> 06:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
over five years um and so when that was
 
06:58:29.190 --> 06:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
in place obviously you don't have
 
06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's no accessibility to buying a
 
06:58:33.510 --> 06:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
property or owning your own property um
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
when that law was that way um that's
 
06:58:37.110 --> 06:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
changed that's been revealed repealed so
 
06:58:39.510 --> 06:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
that charter schools now can do so um
 
06:58:41.670 --> 06:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
but obviously bank borrowing is still
 
06:58:43.510 --> 06:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
very very difficult for them to do so
 
06:58:44.948 --> 06:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
not many have done it most have been
 
06:58:47.190 --> 06:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
leased and to that extent it won't have
 
06:58:50.310 --> 06:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
probably a ton of immediate effect
 
06:58:52.468 --> 06:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
but part of the reason why um charter
 
06:58:54.230 --> 06:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
schools don't own their property is
 
06:58:55.590 --> 06:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
because they've never been eligible for
 
06:58:58.150 --> 06:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
lease aid and so it's sort of the
 
06:58:59.510 --> 06:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
catch 22.
 
06:59:02.150 --> 06:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
um not lease 8 building aid
 
06:59:02.160 --> 06:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
um not lease 8 building aid
um

06:59:03.750 --> 06:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:05.030 --> 06:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that i would add to
 
06:59:06.948 --> 06:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
that obviously it's a very very
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
important assistance to the school to
 
06:59:10.708 --> 06:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
help establish the building the building
 
06:59:10.718 --> 06:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
help establish the building the building
is

06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:59:13.270 --> 06:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
after the teachers
 
06:59:15.350 --> 06:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
the biggest cost that you have
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
in trying to set up a charter school and
 
06:59:19.350 --> 06:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
you want those buildings and facilities
 
06:59:23.270 --> 06:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be um wholesome and conducive to a
 
06:59:25.270 --> 06:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
great educational environment
 
06:59:27.430 --> 06:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i think everybody i plan to talk
 
06:59:29.910 --> 06:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
about who owns the building and how do
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
we how we know we're protected we're
 
06:59:33.030 --> 06:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
putting public money into a charter
 
06:59:33.990 --> 06:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
school building how do we know we're
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
protected but i think that the folks
 
06:59:38.150 --> 06:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
that testified before me especially nate
 
06:59:39.990 --> 06:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
really covered that pretty well the only
 
06:59:41.350 --> 06:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
thing that i would add to it is that the
 
06:59:43.030 --> 06:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
statute does require every single
 
06:59:46.310 --> 06:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
charter school is also a 501c3 charity
 
06:59:47.830 --> 06:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
which is governed by the attorney
 
06:59:49.510 --> 06:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
general's office the director of
 
06:59:51.990 --> 06:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
charitable trust tom donovan supervises
 
06:59:54.548 --> 06:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
everything that we would do with assets
 
06:59:56.150 --> 06:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that i can say for
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
sure is that there isn't any scheme at
 
07:00:00.310 --> 07:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
all in the plan where the ownership of
 
07:00:03.110 --> 07:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
that building ends up in private hands
 
07:00:05.350 --> 07:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's just it's it's not possible to
 
07:00:07.590 --> 07:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
do under all of the various limitations
 
07:00:09.670 --> 07:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
that are out there so
 
07:00:11.190 --> 07:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
one way or another
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
the building will always be dedicated to
 
07:00:16.390 --> 07:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
some public entity some public public
 
07:00:18.150 --> 07:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
good or public use
 
07:00:19.350 --> 07:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that are out there today that
 
07:00:21.270 --> 07:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
are leased are more often owned by a
 
07:00:22.868 --> 07:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
foundation that had to do a lot of
 
07:00:25.670 --> 07:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
fundraising and god bless them for being
 
07:00:27.910 --> 07:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
as successful as they have been in doing
 
07:00:30.708 --> 07:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
that with foundations and fundraising
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
um but
 
07:00:34.868 --> 07:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we embrace charter
 
07:00:38.708 --> 07:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
schools and school choice um is
 
07:00:41.750 --> 07:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
private funding is it relying on the
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
charity of individuals the chosen method
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
to fund public schools
 
07:00:48.468 --> 07:00:48.478 align:start position:0%
these are public schools for public
 
07:00:50.548 --> 07:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
school students and i think it's
 
07:00:52.708 --> 07:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
fantastic that people have come forward
 
07:00:52.718 --> 07:00:54.150 align:start position:0%
fantastic that people have come forward
to

07:00:54.150 --> 07:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
purchase buildings and lease them to
 
07:00:58.230 --> 07:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools or otherwise fundraise
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
and be very very philanthropic
 
07:01:03.110 --> 07:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
that really isn't
 
07:01:03.120 --> 07:01:03.910 align:start position:0%
that really isn't
the

07:01:03.910 --> 07:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:01:06.070 --> 07:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
the way that we ought to approach
 
07:01:07.590 --> 07:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
funding a
 
07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
public need
 
07:01:11.670 --> 07:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
and a public cause
 
07:01:13.270 --> 07:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's all i got thanks thank you very
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
much any any questions
 
07:01:19.510 --> 07:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you yeah now i
 
07:01:22.230 --> 07:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
know i'm done this time i promise
 
07:01:25.510 --> 07:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we're down to the bottom of 14.99 i
 
07:01:27.430 --> 07:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards so with
 
07:01:30.708 --> 07:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
that we're going to close this hearing
 
07:01:33.270 --> 07:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
and that was the last
 
07:01:35.350 --> 07:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
oh you had a hand excuse me well come on
 
07:01:35.360 --> 07:02:08.788 align:start position:0%
oh you had a hand excuse me well come on
up

07:02:11.110 --> 07:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think that was last year
 
07:02:11.120 --> 07:02:12.708 align:start position:0%
i think that was last year
yeah

07:02:12.708 --> 07:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:02:14.868 --> 07:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um

first of all my apology i thought i had
 
07:02:17.910 --> 07:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
the pink card right but apparently not
 
07:02:19.750 --> 07:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
so my apology
 
07:02:21.750 --> 07:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
looks like represent litchfield has it
 
07:02:23.830 --> 07:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
ah all right here we go i'm bill
 
07:02:23.840 --> 07:02:24.868 align:start position:0%
ah all right here we go i'm bill
phillips

07:02:24.868 --> 07:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
phillips
 
07:02:26.310 --> 07:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm with the national alliance for
 
07:02:27.990 --> 07:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
public charter schools
 
07:02:29.750 --> 07:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
um thanks again to the committee for
 
07:02:32.628 --> 07:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
having me um i see how perilous i can be
 
07:02:34.548 --> 07:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh i almost didn't make it
 
07:02:34.558 --> 07:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
uh i almost didn't make it
um

07:02:35.510 --> 07:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:37.350 --> 07:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
so we are obviously in favor of this
 
07:02:38.948 --> 07:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
07:02:40.708 --> 07:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
i think though i've given you testimony
 
07:02:42.310 --> 07:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
but i think the way i'm gonna come at
 
07:02:44.070 --> 07:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
this is i was
 
07:02:45.670 --> 07:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
writing answers to your questions as
 
07:02:47.990 --> 07:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
quickly as i could and so let me frame
 
07:02:49.670 --> 07:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
my testimony to answer as many of your
 
07:02:51.990 --> 07:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions as i can
 
07:02:53.510 --> 07:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
ma'am i'm sorry i don't know your name
 
07:02:55.110 --> 07:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
but you you essentially asked a question
 
07:02:58.070 --> 07:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
of why like why do they need this um
 
07:02:59.670 --> 07:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's how i interpreted your question
 
07:03:01.110 --> 07:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
when you asked it earlier
 
07:03:01.120 --> 07:03:02.070 align:start position:0%
when you asked it earlier
um

07:03:02.070 --> 07:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:03.670 --> 07:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
so here's here's the way i would put it
 
07:03:06.070 --> 07:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
if if you accept that
 
07:03:08.390 --> 07:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
creating options for kids and families
 
07:03:10.548 --> 07:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
through chartering is a policy good if
 
07:03:12.948 --> 07:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
you accept that uh then you have to face
 
07:03:14.070 --> 07:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
some of the things that get in the way
 
07:03:16.230 --> 07:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
of them being able to do that
 
07:03:18.548 --> 07:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
that's typically lack of access to
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
startup funds it's buildings it's talent
 
07:03:22.390 --> 07:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
so obviously today's conversation is
 
07:03:25.510 --> 07:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
about is about the about the buildings
 
07:03:27.990 --> 07:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
this issue is particularly relevant
 
07:03:30.070 --> 07:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh once a school gets established and
 
07:03:31.830 --> 07:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
what i mean by that is typically the
 
07:03:35.270 --> 07:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:37.350 --> 07:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
they get their program in place
 
07:03:39.670 --> 07:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
and they they get their operations under
 
07:03:41.190 --> 07:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
control and then they start to grow
 
07:03:43.110 --> 07:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
typically per the terms of their of
 
07:03:44.948 --> 07:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
their charter
 
07:03:46.788 --> 07:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's once they're getting to a point
 
07:03:48.468 --> 07:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
where they have to grow
 
07:03:50.468 --> 07:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
that that the building actually becomes
 
07:03:51.590 --> 07:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
07:03:54.070 --> 07:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and what i mean by that is it's it's
 
07:03:56.628 --> 07:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
actually difficult for them to to
 
07:03:59.350 --> 07:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
finance their building uh primarily
 
07:04:00.628 --> 07:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
because it's lack of
 
07:04:03.350 --> 07:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
access to local bonding or local funding
 
07:04:05.030 --> 07:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's two problems with it and this is
 
07:04:06.628 --> 07:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
the why
 
07:04:09.670 --> 07:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
this has a programmatic impact um
 
07:04:11.590 --> 07:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things i put in my testimony
 
07:04:12.548 --> 07:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
i think i
 
07:04:14.548 --> 07:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
gave i cited a study i gave you some
 
07:04:14.558 --> 07:04:16.070 align:start position:0%
gave i cited a study i gave you some
statistics

07:04:16.070 --> 07:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
07:04:17.910 --> 07:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does it hurts their
 
07:04:19.990 --> 07:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
programming in two ways
 
07:04:21.750 --> 07:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see in a lot of cases it makes it
 
07:04:23.110 --> 07:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to think to do
 
07:04:24.948 --> 07:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
things like science labs and libraries
 
07:04:26.468 --> 07:04:26.478 align:start position:0%
and kitchens so they're actually
 
07:04:27.590 --> 07:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
obviously it's hard to do science
 
07:04:29.910 --> 07:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
without a science lab in some cases
 
07:04:31.190 --> 07:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing it does to them
 
07:04:31.200 --> 07:04:32.868 align:start position:0%
the other thing it does to them
typically

07:04:32.868 --> 07:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
typically
 
07:04:34.628 --> 07:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
is it forces them to use their
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
operational funding to pay for the
 
07:04:37.750 --> 07:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
building which obviously has an impact
 
07:04:41.350 --> 07:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:41.360 --> 07:04:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:04:42.708 --> 07:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:45.430 --> 07:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
part of what i want to get across is if
 
07:04:47.270 --> 07:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
you agree that we
 
07:04:48.868 --> 07:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
gotta find ways to get at the building
 
07:04:50.868 --> 07:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
issue representative mooney god bless
 
07:04:52.070 --> 07:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
her has
 
07:04:53.990 --> 07:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
proposed a number of things this session
 
07:04:56.310 --> 07:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
to try to get at this um she's talked
 
07:04:57.510 --> 07:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
about the revolving fund we're talking
 
07:04:58.628 --> 07:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
about building aid and we actually
 
07:04:59.990 --> 07:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
talked about bonding a little bit a
 
07:05:01.510 --> 07:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
07:05:01.520 --> 07:05:03.190 align:start position:0%
little bit later
um

07:05:03.190 --> 07:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:05.270 --> 07:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
building aid is is is one of the better
 
07:05:07.110 --> 07:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
ways to get at it because typically what
 
07:05:08.310 --> 07:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking as opposed to like a
 
07:05:10.390 --> 07:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
credit enhancement where you just make
 
07:05:12.468 --> 07:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
the note cheaper building it is you give
 
07:05:13.830 --> 07:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
them a grant you're actually giving them
 
07:05:15.270 --> 07:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
money to pay the bill so that's
 
07:05:16.708 --> 07:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
obviously a very good way to help the
 
07:05:16.718 --> 07:05:18.310 align:start position:0%
obviously a very good way to help the
charters

07:05:18.310 --> 07:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
charters
 
07:05:19.830 --> 07:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
now um
 
07:05:21.270 --> 07:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to go through some of
 
07:05:23.110 --> 07:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
the questions i heard as best i can and
 
07:05:24.390 --> 07:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
obviously if you have more i'm going to
 
07:05:26.548 --> 07:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer
 
07:05:27.750 --> 07:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
something i noticed about the
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate um
 
07:05:31.110 --> 07:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
you picked
 
07:05:33.270 --> 07:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
or i think ms clark mentioned it was at
 
07:05:36.310 --> 07:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
30 which i believe is the lowest number
 
07:05:38.310 --> 07:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
which i think what that means is
 
07:05:39.830 --> 07:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
typically when you do your building aid
 
07:05:41.830 --> 07:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's for towns that have a better
 
07:05:43.270 --> 07:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
ability to pay they would obviously get
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
a lower
 
07:05:46.070 --> 07:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
amount of aid
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
i went and looked just so you know who
 
07:05:49.430 --> 07:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
you'd be serving here
 
07:05:50.708 --> 07:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
07:05:52.548 --> 07:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
children in poverty charters serve about
 
07:05:54.070 --> 07:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
twice the number of children in poverty
 
07:05:56.548 --> 07:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
as district schools do it's it's like
 
07:05:57.670 --> 07:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
seven percent to three and a half
 
07:06:00.310 --> 07:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
percent so not dramatic numbers but
 
07:06:01.990 --> 07:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
the point i'm making to you is you're
 
07:06:04.070 --> 07:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
not the charters are not serving
 
07:06:07.590 --> 07:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
affluent kids or influent communities
 
07:06:09.590 --> 07:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
you might
 
07:06:10.788 --> 07:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
i wish mrs clark was here i was going to
 
07:06:12.310 --> 07:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
tease her we threw that you know hot
 
07:06:13.910 --> 07:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
potato at her for hey hear the
 
07:06:15.830 --> 07:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
department make up a number for us and i
 
07:06:18.868 --> 07:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
i see she threw it right back at us um
 
07:06:20.468 --> 07:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
you might want to not have it at 30. if
 
07:06:21.830 --> 07:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
you if you're interested in doing this
 
07:06:23.430 --> 07:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the median
 
07:06:25.430 --> 07:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know which is probably closer to
 
07:06:28.310 --> 07:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
40. maybe it's the average but
 
07:06:30.310 --> 07:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
30 is the lowest number and
 
07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
the kids being server not those kids
 
07:06:35.670 --> 07:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman i think you asked a
 
07:06:37.350 --> 07:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
question like how do they
 
07:06:40.070 --> 07:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know how did the bonding be done
 
07:06:40.080 --> 07:06:41.190 align:start position:0%
you know how did the bonding be done
um

07:06:41.190 --> 07:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
what they would do is there's you know
 
07:06:44.070 --> 07:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
if they were doing a construction
 
07:06:45.670 --> 07:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
project they you know you do a
 
07:06:47.110 --> 07:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
construction note and it typically gets
 
07:06:49.350 --> 07:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
taken out by private bonding or you can
 
07:06:51.030 --> 07:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
just you can actually just bond the
 
07:06:53.670 --> 07:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
project privately what this would do is
 
07:06:55.750 --> 07:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would make it easier to get private
 
07:06:55.760 --> 07:06:56.868 align:start position:0%
it would make it easier to get private
bonding

07:06:56.868 --> 07:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
07:06:59.910 --> 07:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
or private or private financing
 
07:06:59.920 --> 07:07:01.110 align:start position:0%
or private or private financing
um

07:07:01.110 --> 07:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:03.270 --> 07:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
the ownership question
 
07:07:03.280 --> 07:07:04.468 align:start position:0%
the ownership question
um

07:07:04.468 --> 07:07:04.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:06.708 --> 07:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
so i think i think was mister it was
 
07:07:08.230 --> 07:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
best was last mr best he was up here
 
07:07:10.070 --> 07:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
four times i should know his name um
 
07:07:12.150 --> 07:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
mr best he he's right
 
07:07:14.390 --> 07:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the on the owner on this ownership
 
07:07:16.548 --> 07:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
issue and what i mean by that is
 
07:07:17.910 --> 07:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
the reason most of the chart i didn't
 
07:07:19.110 --> 07:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
know about i didn't know about the legal
 
07:07:20.868 --> 07:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
prohibition but the reason most of the
 
07:07:20.878 --> 07:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
prohibition but the reason most of the
charters

07:07:21.910 --> 07:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
charters
 
07:07:23.510 --> 07:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
are leasing they can't afford to own
 
07:07:24.948 --> 07:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
their buildings they literally cannot do
 
07:07:26.548 --> 07:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
the financing for it so this would
 
07:07:27.990 --> 07:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually put some of them in a position
 
07:07:30.788 --> 07:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:33.670 --> 07:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
the closure question the
 
07:07:35.990 --> 07:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the one thing i think
 
07:07:38.230 --> 07:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
we might want to check
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
my experience with
 
07:07:42.830 --> 07:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
the dissolution process
 
07:07:45.670 --> 07:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
is a charter is closed
 
07:07:47.190 --> 07:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
um it
 
07:07:48.628 --> 07:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
you know they go through a dissolution
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
process which includes
 
07:07:53.430 --> 07:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
selling off its assets
 
07:07:55.190 --> 07:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
my assumption or the way i would
 
07:07:58.468 --> 07:07:58.478 align:start position:0%
recommend considering this or doing this
 
07:08:00.468 --> 07:08:00.478 align:start position:0%
you sell off the building
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
you pay off the bondholder and you pay
 
07:08:04.708 --> 07:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
off the state which would get at your
 
07:08:06.628 --> 07:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
question which is like you mentioned
 
07:08:08.150 --> 07:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
that current process says you've got to
 
07:08:09.910 --> 07:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
pay to pay the um
 
07:08:11.990 --> 07:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the aid back the way i would do it is
 
07:08:12.000 --> 07:08:13.270 align:start position:0%
the aid back the way i would do it is
the

07:08:13.270 --> 07:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:08:15.110 --> 07:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
to basically when you sell the asset pay
 
07:08:15.120 --> 07:08:15.990 align:start position:0%
to basically when you sell the asset pay
the

07:08:15.990 --> 07:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
pay back the bond holder and pay back
 
07:08:19.830 --> 07:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
07:08:19.840 --> 07:08:21.030 align:start position:0%
the state
um

07:08:21.030 --> 07:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:25.270 --> 07:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:26.708 --> 07:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
representative luna i noticed you asked
 
07:08:28.070 --> 07:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of building end questions so i'm
 
07:08:29.110 --> 07:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to assume you were going to ask me
 
07:08:30.868 --> 07:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
this question so how's this
 
07:08:33.350 --> 07:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong you get me
 
07:08:33.360 --> 07:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong you get me
um

07:08:34.310 --> 07:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:36.070 --> 07:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
selling off the asset
 
07:08:39.750 --> 07:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
it works great when the asset is
 
07:08:41.430 --> 07:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
greater than the cost right then
 
07:08:42.708 --> 07:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
everybody gets paid back and everybody's
 
07:08:44.548 --> 07:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
happy i think the next question comes up
 
07:08:46.868 --> 07:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
is what happens when it's less right
 
07:08:48.390 --> 07:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the question i would ask is who's in
 
07:08:48.400 --> 07:08:50.310 align:start position:0%
and the question i would ask is who's in
front

07:08:50.310 --> 07:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
front
 
07:08:52.390 --> 07:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
this is where i i don't have a great
 
07:08:53.510 --> 07:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
answer for you but i have a couple
 
07:08:53.520 --> 07:08:54.390 align:start position:0%
answer for you but i have a couple
solutions

07:08:54.390 --> 07:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
07:08:55.990 --> 07:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
you have to put the bondholder in front
 
07:08:57.350 --> 07:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise they won't they won't be able
 
07:08:59.030 --> 07:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
to finance the building the state has to
 
07:09:01.270 --> 07:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
go second in terms of who gets who gets
 
07:09:01.280 --> 07:09:02.230 align:start position:0%
go second in terms of who gets who gets
paid

07:09:02.230 --> 07:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
paid
 
07:09:05.030 --> 07:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
i i think there's um
 
07:09:05.040 --> 07:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
i i think there's um
there's

07:09:06.150 --> 07:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
there's
 
07:09:07.990 --> 07:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
one of the ways to get at that and this
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
goes to the federal um
 
07:09:12.230 --> 07:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
um representative tanner you asked about
 
07:09:12.240 --> 07:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
um representative tanner you asked about
the

07:09:13.750 --> 07:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:09:16.868 --> 07:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
there is a federal credit enhancement
 
07:09:16.878 --> 07:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
there is a federal credit enhancement
grant

07:09:17.910 --> 07:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
grant
 
07:09:17.920 --> 07:09:18.868 align:start position:0%
grant
um

07:09:18.868 --> 07:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:20.070 --> 07:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
and what you could do is you could
 
07:09:21.670 --> 07:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually apply for that grant and what
 
07:09:23.510 --> 07:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
you could do is create a loan fund which
 
07:09:25.510 --> 07:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
would you could use as coverage for
 
07:09:27.110 --> 07:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
those cases where the
 
07:09:29.590 --> 07:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
state needs to be needs to be covered
 
07:09:31.590 --> 07:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
frankly you'd be more competitive for
 
07:09:33.510 --> 07:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
that grant if we actually had a program
 
07:09:35.430 --> 07:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
like this to point to
 
07:09:35.440 --> 07:09:36.548 align:start position:0%
like this to point to
so

07:09:36.548 --> 07:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:09:36.558 --> 07:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:09:37.590 --> 07:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:39.350 --> 07:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's what i have are there any
 
07:09:39.360 --> 07:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
that's what i have are there any
questions

07:09:41.030 --> 07:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:09:42.948 --> 07:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
07:09:46.868 --> 07:09:46.878 align:start position:0%

alliance for public charter schools i'll
 
07:10:14.310 --> 07:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
try to make this brief i know you've
 
07:10:15.750 --> 07:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
been here all day
 
07:10:18.070 --> 07:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh so we have three schools that
 
07:10:21.030 --> 07:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently uh own their own buildings
 
07:10:22.868 --> 07:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
two schools
 
07:10:24.948 --> 07:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh own their own buildings however those
 
07:10:24.958 --> 07:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
uh own their own buildings however those
are

07:10:25.910 --> 07:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:10:27.670 --> 07:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
actually owned through foundations that
 
07:10:29.910 --> 07:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
lease the building back to them
 
07:10:32.390 --> 07:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
one school owns property and they would
 
07:10:34.310 --> 07:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
like to build a building on that
 
07:10:34.320 --> 07:10:35.430 align:start position:0%
like to build a building on that
property

07:10:35.430 --> 07:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
property
 
07:10:38.230 --> 07:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to reiterate that if
 
07:10:39.670 --> 07:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools were entered into the
 
07:10:41.830 --> 07:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
building aid formula or made eligible
 
07:10:44.150 --> 07:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
for it this would only be eligible for
 
07:10:44.160 --> 07:10:45.190 align:start position:0%
for it this would only be eligible for
schools

07:10:45.190 --> 07:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
07:10:46.948 --> 07:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
that own the property and the building
 
07:10:48.948 --> 07:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about all the we're
 
07:10:50.150 --> 07:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
not talking about all the charter
 
07:10:52.548 --> 07:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
schools that currently lease facilities
 
07:10:53.750 --> 07:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's an important
 
07:10:53.760 --> 07:10:54.788 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's an important
part

07:10:54.788 --> 07:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
part
 
07:10:57.270 --> 07:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
above all i think this is for
 
07:10:58.948 --> 07:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
fairness charter schools or public
 
07:11:00.230 --> 07:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
schools i just believe that they should
 
07:11:03.350 --> 07:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
be eligible and that's all i had
 
07:11:04.788 --> 07:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:11:08.150 --> 07:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
are there questions for matt
 
07:11:12.468 --> 07:11:12.478 align:start position:0%

07:14:22.948 --> 07:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
07:14:25.350 --> 07:14:25.360 align:start position:0%

07:14:27.750 --> 07:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'll put together a list of things i'll
 
07:14:35.510 --> 07:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:38.230 --> 07:14:38.240 align:start position:0%

and then i've also communicated that
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
with diana and i think that they may
 
07:14:47.750 --> 07:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
have some language for us okay good yeah
 
07:14:49.510 --> 07:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
good so maybe we can pull this so i
 
07:14:50.788 --> 07:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
don't think you have to start working
 
07:14:52.070 --> 07:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
hard on that because i think we're going
 
07:14:54.150 --> 07:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
to get it good good and and we don't
 
07:14:55.510 --> 07:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
