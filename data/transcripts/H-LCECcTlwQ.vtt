everybody Welcome to environment and
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
agriculture this morning and I'd like to
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
start our
 
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
meeting uh with the Pledge of Allegiance
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
all thank you thank you all for being
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
here and braving the elements in order
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
us I'm just getting the pink cards put
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
together here for uh for our
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and um I want to uh as per
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative B bixby's request
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh we have three bills this morning
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with Organic uh certification
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
organic food
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
certification um if you have some
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
comments to make in general about
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
organic farming Organic
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
certification you could you are invited
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
to make those
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
comments um in the test testimony for
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
our hearing for HB
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
1184 but we we would like to uh limit
 
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.029 align:start position:0%
1184 but we we would like to uh limit
the

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
discussion um
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
on specific parts of these
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
bills um so if you have specific
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
information regarding testimony for an
 
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
individual bill please make those at the
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
heard we are going to start off this
 
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
morning with HB
 
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
1184 which is relative to making an
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation to The Organic
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
certification program I'm going to uh
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
open this meeting inviting the sponsor
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill representative Bixby to
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you madam
 
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
chair for the record representative
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby representing Dober uh and um
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
also a member of this committee uh
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh what I'm presenting here is
 
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh relative to making appropriation uh
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
to The Organic certification program and
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
the real purpose of HB 1184 is to
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
strengthen the Organic certification in
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
and food before I get into the details
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill I want to present some
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
background on Organic certification
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's more to organic than food you
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
pay more for so you don't so you know it
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
won't have nasty
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
chemicals uh in the mid
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
early to mid 20th century Agricultural
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
Science split into two branches the
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
dominant Branch with heavy investment
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
from industry and a lot of work from
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
land grant universities focused on
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals that help plants grow how
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
could farmers use soluble chemically
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
active forms of nutrients like nitrogen
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and potassium to get plants
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
faster what chemicals when sprayed on
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
Plants would reduce Pest and disease
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
pressure what herbicides would kill
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
competing weeds it turned out that the
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
nitrogen reduction process developed in
 
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
World War I for making bombs could also
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
produce fertilizer and nerve toxins used
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
for chemical warfare also killed insect
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
pests the other branch which garnered
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
very little corporate interest
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
considered bi considered biologically
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
active soil to be key to good plant
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
growth if you feed the soil the soil
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
will provide the right nutrients uh the
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
right amounts of available nitrogen
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
potassium and phosphorus to the plants
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
Central to this soil-based approach was
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
adding a lot of compost to the soil
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
because compost is rich in decaying
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
organic matter this approach to
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture became called organic in
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
English it's called um biological in
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.909 align:start position:0%
English it's called um biological in
other

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
languages uh organic plant scientists
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
were concerned that since that synthetic
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
pesticides and fungicides would harm
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
soil health so they limited pesticide
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
and fungicide use to biologically Source
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
materials organic agriculture went from
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
being a very tiny Niche to a somewhat
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
less tiny niche in the 19660 s When
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
Rachel Carson's work exposed the
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
downsides of DD DDT and other synthetic
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
pesticides in the 1970s and and 1980s
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
the organic organic food became more
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
popular and enough more profitable
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
profitable that producers feared that
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous sellers would claim food
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
was organically grown when it was
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
not a number of private mostly nonprofit
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
or organic farming organizations started
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
certification programs to verify organic
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
practices in our region the main farmers
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
and gardeners Association or mfka and
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
the various State branches of the
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
Northeast organic Farmers Association or
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
NOA filled this
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
role the Myriad different certifiers did
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
not agree on the standards for organic
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
production and some felt others were too
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
laxs Congress saw different St standards
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
as creating the potential for fraud and
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that placed the USDA in
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
charge of creating a national organic
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
program the national the NOP created
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
standards for organic uh for organic
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
agricultural practices and allowable
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
materials the standards would be
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
overseen by accredit accredited
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
certifying agencies or acas an ACA could
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
not also be an advising or ad ad
 
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.350 align:start position:0%
not also be an advising or ad ad
advocacy

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
organization in some
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
states the Department of Agriculture set
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
up an an ACA program many of the private
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
certifiers were part of organizations
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
that did advising and advoc advocacy a
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
lot of these spun-off separate
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
corporations to become acas including
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
mafka NOA Vermont NOA Mas
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
Etc it should be not noted that the NOP
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
made no requirement that farmers get
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
certified by a specific ACA in their
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
region any ACA willing to work with a
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
farm would count as long as an ACA
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
certifies a farm it can Market its
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
products as USD or USDA organic without
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
ACA certification no claims of organic
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
can be made NOA New Hampshire found the
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
challenge of setting up an ACA to be
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
substantial so the department of
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
agricult Department of Agriculture
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
markets and food under former
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steve Taylor offered to
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
take on that role and helped develop
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that to make that possible
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
the work of certification would be done
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
under the division of regulatory
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
services using division
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel the department has been
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
working with New Hampshire organic
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
farmers who chose who choose to use
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
their services for more than two decades
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
ades just as a reminder even though many
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
people use organic as a proxy for a free
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
of synthetic chemicals the term really
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
means farming
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
practices are aimed at creating healthy
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
plants another aspect of certification
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
we need to touch on is Scopes organic
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
standards are divided into four branches
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
or Scopes crops crops and produce animal
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture processing and handling and
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
wildcrafting the US USDA approves acas
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
separately for each scope and each scope
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
has different requirements so not all
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
CER certifiers cover all four Scopes
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
until 2021 the Department of Agriculture
 
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
markets and Foods did all four Scopes in
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
the summer of 2021 the former director
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
of regulatory Services left on fairly
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
short notice for family reasons on the
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
way out she informed the commissioner
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
that the Department's compliance with
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
the animal Agriculture and processing
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
and handling Scopes was having serious
 
00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
and handling Scopes was having serious
problems

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
the department tried to find a remedy
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
but determined that there was a serious
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
risk that the national organic program
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
would remove their certification unless
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
a number of Fairly costly steps were
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
taken the department informed farmers
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
and businesses
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
using animal and animal and processing
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
handling Scopes that they would need to
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
find alternative certifiers for the
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
following year this created a great deal
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
of unhappiness and I think there might
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
be some people testifying after me who
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
might mention that a Senate bill was fi
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
filed in an attempt to fix the problem
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
but it did not pass the department
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
scaled back doing only the crop and
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
produce scope which does include maple
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
syrup when the commission when the
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner received the most recent
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
audit from USDA NOP in early 2023 he
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
realized that some improvements needed
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
to be made to the structure of the
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
certification program to make it
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
sustainable he reached out to TOA New
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help figure out a plan of
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
action NOA New Hampshire surveyed their
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
farmer members and held listening
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
sessions to get a sense of what New
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farmers would prefer there was
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
strong support among the respondents for
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
uh damp to consider continue
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
certification even if it would require
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
higher fees in the future because of
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
that support I offered to file this bill
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is it creates one and
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
a half specific organ specific Organic
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
certification positions in the
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
department which is which is one change
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
encouraged by the national Grant or
 
00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
encouraged by the national Grant or
organic

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
organic
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
program the bill also makes an
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation for them for the second
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
year of this bium that appropriation
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
will be partially off offset by fees I'm
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but I will defer
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
most questions about finances workload
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
and noop requirement to the commissioner
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
I believe that there are members of the
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
organic farming committee here who would
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
also who will also be providing input
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Bixby
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
does the committee members any committee
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
members have questions
 
00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.150 align:start position:0%
members have questions
regarding

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Duty good
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you thank you
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I so we have
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
an another bill coming forward I believe
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
this morning that involves the
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
USDA it m if if we passed this bill so
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
is this actually a standalone bill and
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
the one and a half position would uh be
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
um an assist to organic farmers or is
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
there a whole package that we need to be
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
considering so the the three bills we're
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning are all completely
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
separate bills uh so they all they all
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
stand on their own merits um
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
and uh this bill is specifically about
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
providing the resources to the
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
department to be able to uh continue to
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
do the organic uh program and this is
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is really about
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
resources thank
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
you so my question is um do we already
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
have this program
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
funded uh I can the the commissioner can
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
talk about that in more detail but uh
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the program was not funded as a separate
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
entity uh and still is not funded as a
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
separate entity it is uh under the
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
department of regulatory services and it
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
uses uh regulatory Services Personnel uh
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
and and the way that those Personnel are
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
funded uh is something that the uh
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner can speak to more clearly
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
than I can thank you any other questions
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
Bixby seeing none thank you and let's
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
move on and I call up uh Joyce
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
Ford who has requested three minutes to
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
Ford I'm a little nervous this is my

first time ever testifying so well we
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
don't bite it's okay and if you have
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
testimony be welling it would be uh nice
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
to pass it around
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
way Madame chair members of the
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you my name is Joyce
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
Ford I'm from Hillsboro New Hampshire I
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
have been involved in Organic
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
certification since the 1980s and I
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
currently serve as accreditation
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
committee chair for an international
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
organization that accredits Organic
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
certification bodies
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
globally Organic certification is
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
required if an operation uses the term
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
organic in any of its Marketing in 2023
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
the USDA has imposed new rules on
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
accredited certifying agents I will
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
refer to them as acas to kind of shorten
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
it up as part of their strengthening
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
organic enforcement rules which are
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
implemented by March 19th
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
2024 so in addition to requiring more
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
types of operations in the supply chain
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
to be certified all inspectors and
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
certifier reviewers have specific
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
qualification and training requirements
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
new ones and this Rule now requires
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
certifying agents to conduct uh 5% of
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
their operations as unannounced
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
inspections complete mass balance
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
balance audits during the annual on-site
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
inspections and verify traceability back
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
to the previous certified operation in
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the supply chain during
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
inspections I know this is pretty
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
technical but I just want you to know
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
that this is a very technical program
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
that that needs people who are very
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
trained to do this kind of work so in
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
order to remain accredited the New
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
markets and Foods Organic certification
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
program needs funding to adequately
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
train their personnel to comply with
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
these new rules schols they will need an
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
adequate number of staff to review
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
applications perform the on-site
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
inspections and provide final reviews of
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
all certification documents for
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
operations before making the
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
certification decision and all of these
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
steps require a quality management
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
system that tracks these
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
activities one additional point I would
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
like to make most accredited organic
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
certifying agents base their sliding
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
scale fee structure which is public
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
information on their website
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
on Gross organic sales this allows
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
smaller organic farmers to get certified
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
without undue financial hardship the New
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
markets and food currently bases their
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
fee structure on acreage or Greenhouse
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
square footage neither of which is a
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
marker of the size income a farmer can
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
actually make on that amount of land the
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
department says it doesn't collect gross
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
organic sales information in the
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
application but it could um then they
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
also could then use a sliding scale fee
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
structure to keep organic the smaller
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
organic farm certified so I support
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1184 FNA which increases
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
funding for the New Hampshire Department
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
of aegs markets and food Organic
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
certification program to allow the
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
department to maintain their
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
accreditation status with the USDA for
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
the crop scope thank you thank you so
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%

Ford yeah no questions so thank
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%

Trumble where are you from Mr Trumble um
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'm from the town of wear thank you my
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
name is David Trumble I'm a certified
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
organic farmer I have been certified
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
organic since 1987 the first year that
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
we had Organic certification in the
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
state I want to talk about three things
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
first is a little history of the program
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
and second is just a couple brief
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
comments about organic and then a few
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
comments about the bill itself in the
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
mid 80s NOA worked with the state
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
legislature to create the statute that
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
set up Organic certification in the
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
first two years NOA did the
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
certification I was on the board of NOA
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
at that time the Department of
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture came to one of our board
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
meetings and said what would you think
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
if we took over the program and NOA said
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
yes the Department of Agriculture said
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
we can build this program we have the
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
resources NOA didn't have those
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
resources so there was a commitment made
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
to grow the program and it did grow to
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
almost 200 farms uh not that many years
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
ago that history is important because it
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
shows that the Department of Agriculture
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
made a commitment and that commitment is
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
what grew the program in the state those
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
resources were essential over the last
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
38 years the organic farmers in the
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
state have worked with the Department of
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
Agriculture cooperatively in a lot of
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
ways the department set up an organic
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh they provided
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
trainings to other Farmers that were put
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
on by the department but the trainings
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
were done by the organic farmers and the
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner tur or organic farms to see
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
their production techniques and and
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
personally I was involved in all three
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
of those uh different aspects that
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
history is important because it shows
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
that there's been a longstanding mutual
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
respect between the organic farming
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
community and the Department of
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and also I think it aligns
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
with the Department's duties described
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the statute that's
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
4252 which says that the department
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for promoting and
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulating agriculture in all its
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
branches uh whether you conceive of
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
organic farming as a separate branch of
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's agriculture or whether
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
or not we are populated in all the
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
branches but in any event we're there
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
we're in every branch of Agriculture and
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that the department does
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
the regulating for our program I don't
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
have data I don't think there is any
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
data but my back of the envelope
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
estimate is that we collectively sell
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
millions if not10 million dollars worth
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
of agricultural products every year we
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
help support a good thousand workers
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
directly and indirectly and we obviously
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
Farm tens of thousands of Acres my
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
concern I support this bill 100% I have
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
been a member of the certification
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
through the department of a I like the
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
department of a certifiers they do a
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
thorough exceptionally professional job
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is a good step in the
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
right direction my concern is the way
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
it's worded it sounds as though by 2026
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
the fees will have to support the entire
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
program those fees that we have been
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
able to see are not reasonable they
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
estimate based on what it's like now my
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
farm a relatively small farm would cost
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
$4,900 a year to certify right now I pay
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
$350 a year to certify in Vermont my
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
farm would cost a little less than 900
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
to certify if I did it through Maine it
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
would be $1,400 there's no way I can
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
justify almost $5,000 in certification
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
fees when I could get it done for about
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
one4 of the cost with another agency if
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
you adopt this bill but don't adequately
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
fund it to keep the fees affordable no
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
organic farmers are going to sign up for
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
it and eventually the program will die I
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
know that there's the argument that the
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
prices haven't gone up in time but even
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
if you took 350 50 for my farm as the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
starting point 38 years ago do a Google
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
inflation calculator the price would be
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
$940 so yes fees should go up they
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
should have been set to inflation to go
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
up every year but going up to the amount
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
that it would be what it costs to
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
support the program these these fees are
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
too much it's going to lead to the end
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the program so I support this program
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can continue to work with
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture and I hope
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
that you will support the funding so
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the fees would be set comparable to
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
what it costs in Vermont or Maine in
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
other words if you don't want the
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
farmers to flee the program make what
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
the farmers pay comparable to what they
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
can get it from another certifier and
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
have the state pay the balance and I
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
think that would be about 1/4 of the the
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have uh from the
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you thank you I have
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
a question and and then uh
 
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.430 align:start position:0%
a question and and then uh
representative

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
ktoa so are you your farm is your farm
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
certified through the new
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um certification process I've
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
been certified with the Department of
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
Agriculture for the last 36 years the
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
two before that NOA had the program but
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
yes how much how much does it cost you
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
to do that in three $350 is what I pay
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
$350 okay um and but there are other
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
organizations that will
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
certify uh an organic farm yes in Maine
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's called mafka it's the organic
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
farmers their price system as was
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned is set up by gross sales so
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
for between I'm sorry I have the numbers
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh in Maine a farm that's 60,000 to
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
100,000 so just a relatively small farm
 
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
100,000 so just a relatively small farm
is

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
$1,400 anywhere between 100 and2 200,000
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
it only goes up to
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
$1,600 so that's affordable in Vermont
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
they have like a formula but a $70,000
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
farm would be
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
$870 a $100,000 farm would be
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
$1,013 and $150,000 farm would be ,25 so
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's affordable for the farmers at those
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
rates the the if you make the farmers in
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pay for this program in
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
its entirety the rates will be so high
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
no very few will do it and once if half
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the farmers leave then scope and
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
scale you're still going to have these
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors that the price is going to go
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
up even more eventually the program will
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
collapse so if if we want a program
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's run by the government we have to
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
find fees that are affordable for the
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
farmers with which is going to require
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
subsid um representative kto you have a
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
question uh thank thank you uh Madam
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for coming here
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
today in this weather and uh taking my
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
question and my question is basically uh
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
probably a reiteration of what
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron talked but I just
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I understand
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
you can get certifi your Organic
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
certification through mofa or the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
Vermont program is that correct you you
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
can when the uh State eliminated the
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
dairy and the bread and the processors
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
program those Farms continued to be
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
organic and they had to go find
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
certifiers from out of the state and I
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
forget who testified but said that the
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
federal governments does not require
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
that you that you be certified by the
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
the certifier within your state so you
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
can go to another certifier I I believe
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
the statistics I've seen we have 66
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms left in New Hampshire and
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
there's about 50 Organic Farms that are
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
certified by someone else right
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
now representative K followup thank you
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair So based on what you just
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
said uh the dairy farms had to find
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
someone else to certify them and what
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
did you say that number was that are
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
currently being certified by the
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture I believe
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's 66 right now last year and
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's another 50 that are certified
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
organic farms but not certified I'm
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the question I
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
didn't uh and there's another 50 that
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
are not certified by nhda by by some
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
other certifier and the this when we
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
when this news came out we a few farmers
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
and one of them who started the petition
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
is going to speak started a petition
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
because we want to support this program
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
and like without really a great deal of
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
effort a thousand people supported the
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
petition to keep the program alive in
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so in the discussions
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
that have happened between the farmers
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
and NOA and some with the Department of
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture if this program doesn't
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
survive NOA has considered the
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
possibility of setting up a satellite
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
program where they would basically
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
become kind of like a link for New
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farmers to get certified by
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
another another certification agency and
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
that would be a decent backup program
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
but I feel like it the state support for
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
this program is important because
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
organic farmers are an important part of
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's agriculture so I I would
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to see the
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
government you know pay what's necessary
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
so that we keep the program strong and
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at other professionals
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
electricians pay $180 a year to get
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
their license renewed each year master
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
plumbers pay 300 every two years so
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's about what I'm paying if you made
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
plumbers and electricians all of a
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
sudden pay $4,000 a year to get
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
certified to get their license renewed
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
you'd have a room full of angry plumbers
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
and electricians so we're just saying
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
help keep this program
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
alive thank you representative kraton
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
you had a question I'm sorry thank you
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony I'm diving
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
into something that you've been doing
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
for 37 years so so bear with me here so
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
this bill right here
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
1184 it is authorizing from the state
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
$220,000 to pay for one one and a half
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
people that's it right that's all this
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
bill does well there's another provision
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
in the bill I'm sorry thank you for the
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
please I'm just reading what I'm reading
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
here yep there's something um down in
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
the methodology section on on the page
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
see making the they want to make the
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
program self- sustaining and fiscal year
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
2026 and each year thereafter so that's
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
and I look at the chart with the funds
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
the expenditure is still 220 every year
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
for 25 26 27 but the appropriation is
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
220 220,000 in year 2025 but then it's
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
zero after that so I I I think there's a
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
the way if it goes the way it's worded
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
here for one year you subsidize the
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
program after that the farmers pay the
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
whole cost so I I'm just saying I hope
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
that you'll keep that appropriation
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
going on going forward
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay and so for follow pleas should
 
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.909 align:start position:0%
okay and so for follow pleas should
follow

00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
up okay so today you're paying roughly
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
300 where does the 4,000 come in where
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
am I reading that in this bill it's not
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
here um during all these discussions
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
like I said we've had like a half a
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
dozen meetings to get ready for this we
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
were told that the the fee range would
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
go from a low of 2900 to a high of
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
4,900 so for my operation I have a few
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
Acres of vegetables and four green
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
houses which is 6,000 ft which under the
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
formula would put me at the high end I'd
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
be my farm would be almost $5,000 to
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
certify and I'm sorry go and that's in
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
26 27 when it goes to zero that would be
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
cor is that that's your that's your
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
connection that's my understanding State
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
takes away the money and then you have
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
to absorb that 2200 divided by 116
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
different Farms right so I would say one
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
way to do that is either to say the
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
state will make the farmer fees equal to
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
what Vermont and Maine pay or the state
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
could adopt a sliding scale like Maine
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
has Maine just says if your farm grosses
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
this much and it breaks it down into
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
income brackets you pay this much so
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
that way the system that we have for the
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
right now the acreage plus the green
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
houses was started decades ago in fact
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
that was part of being on the advisory
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
organic committee Vicky Smith asked me
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
and a couple other Farmers to help her
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
come up with a fee structure so we we
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
looked at green houses and said well if
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
you got this many square feet you're
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
probably but making this much money so
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
we we actually came up with these
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
numbers and they made sense when it was
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
a total of $300 for the year but now
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
when it's being asked to cover the
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
entire cost it doesn't make sense
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's no way a farm like mine could
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
pay a $5,000 fee so the the the basis of
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
the of the system acreage or square
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
footage should be changed to gross
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
income on the farm okay I'm sorry one so
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
one last one last I'm
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
I'm so under the current system
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
if it's 300
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
bucks why are we changing that if the
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
new system is going to cost 4,000 bucks
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
we're changing that because the cost to
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture is
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
exceeding the amount of money they're
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
bringing in in fees the fees are too low
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
right now they were never adjusted for
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
inflation so they should have gone up so
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
they'd be getting more fee money but
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
even with that they're saying that the
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
the cost of running the program would
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
exceed even an inflationary increase so
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the program alive they
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
want the program to either be funded by
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
you in its entirety or the Farmers fund
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
it I'm saying we can't afford to fund it
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
so we need you to to chip in and make it
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
affordable okay thank you so much
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank representative
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um that was
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
just more along and thank you for taking
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
my question it was more along the same
 
00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
lines I was just wanting to make sure
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that I understood that you were talking
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
about the square footage model and
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
you're making the assumption that under
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
rules that's the way they're going to
 
00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.789 align:start position:0%
rules that's the way they're going to
continue

00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
to uh account for the fees I I don't
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
know that it's been decided yet okay but
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
I was just saying I would Advocate a a
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
gross income model it's it's more
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
Equitable and it would encourage young
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers I mean the the key thing is we
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to discourage young farmers
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
who are getting into farming who look at
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
this and say the the the floor is too
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
expensive there's no way I'll never even
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
join the New Hampshire program we have
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
to make it so that they come in and as
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
their Farm expands their their income
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
will go up their certification costs go
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
up but if the floor is too high no young
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
farmer will ever even join the program
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%

competitive with other certifying

farmers we understand that the fees
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
would need to increase

um however I understand from speaking
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
with representative Bixby that the fees
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
are actually not what this bill is
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
trying to advocate for um we are going
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
to continue to Advocate with the
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
department for Equitable fees for
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
Farmers on this program we also
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
understand um as Dave Trumble was just
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
saying as well that if the fees increase
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
significantly um Farmers could likely
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
switch to other certifying
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
agencies commissioner Jasper has assured
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
us that he values the organic farming
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
community and wants to support organic
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
farmers and we hear that the department
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
is underfunded and needs this funding
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has developed a
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
solution with this bill that will will
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
increase the Staffing required by New
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire damp to continue providing an
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
Organic certification program and again
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
we are advocating for um fees that will
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
be reasonable and accessible for organic
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
farmers so that this program is not cost
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:02.190 align:start position:0%
farmers so that this program is not cost
prohibitive

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's Farmers work
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to preserve our state's
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
agricultural landscape and Heritage and
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
should be adequately supported again
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
through reasonable certification fees
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
for Farmers who've depended on and
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
supported this program Through The Years
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
or by some other means uh NOA New
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports HB 1184 and the
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
farmers who are calling on New Hampshire
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
damp to continue supporting them now and
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
into the future thank you and thank you
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
for your patience with my
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
modification question uh representative
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
um Morris thank you thank you for taking
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
my question I just wondered if you could
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
tell me the total number of certified
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
organic farms in New Hampshire and how
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
many um on average are yearly getting
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
certified the total through the
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
department of a or yes okay through the
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
department of a there's currently 66
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
certified organic farms and currently
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
farmers can only be certified for crops
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I to see
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
you you said 66 in New Hampshire 66
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
certified by the Department of
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
Agriculture yes there are more than that
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
certified by other acas representative
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
Duty yes uh thank you madam chair thank
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um if a
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
farmer can get certified in Vermont or
 
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.589 align:start position:0%
farmer can get certified in Vermont or
uh

00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
Maine is there a downside to that and uh
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know I guess my question is why do
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
we need one in New Hampshire if there
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
are other options are there any
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
downsides to
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
that my first response to that is that
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
um Farmers have consistently stated that
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
they specifically value this program as
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
a direct connection to the Department of
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and they feel that it helps
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
represent them um at the state and it is
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
a it is the number one way that they
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
feel supported by the department of a
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
the organic farmers who currently are
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
certified they can certify with other um
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
acas if they want but they choose to
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
certify with the Department of a because
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
they value that service
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
deeply I hope that
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
helps any other questions from the
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative coma thank you
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you uh for taking
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
my question and being here um my
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
question is is that the top program has
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
a $100 million grant for the
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
transitioning couldn't they use some of
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
those funds to help these people uh get
 
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.550 align:start position:0%
those funds to help these people uh get
certified

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
organically that's a great question
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
thank you the top program um is not
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be valuing or putting
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
emphasis on one ACA over another so it
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
does not pay for Farmers to become
 
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
certified it's focused on mentorship
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
technical assistance Community Building
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development but not to pay
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
Farmers to become certified organic it's
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
a more of a yeah an educational
 
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.349 align:start position:0%
a more of a yeah an educational
program

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%

see organic products
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
everywhere but more of those products
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
need to be produced here in the granite
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
state and the legislature should do all
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
you can to support and promote organic
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
production and certification in our
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
state this isn't an investment in our
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
agriculture environment and Food
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
Systems and the farmers here in New
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need a new hampshire-based
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
Organic certification program that's
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
fully funded that's well staffed and
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
professional to provide certification
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
services in the granite state yes
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
farmers can go elsewhere but if there's
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
a a a strong reliable certifier in the
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
State I see it as just part of the New
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage so I hope you can
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%

and uh get the professional staff that
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%

chair um and thank you for Tes in Mr
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
riddle I wonder if you could help me
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
understand a little better about the
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
previous comment made about the
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
connection to the department as being an
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
asset of New Hampshire
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
certification perhaps this is for the
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm not sure yeah I
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
um there's a certain identity that
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
farmers have uh built in relation to
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
their certification status and um it's a
 
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire logo that they get to
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
carry in addition to the very familiar
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
USDA organic seal that um I think many
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
farmers are quite attached to their
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
buyers look for um and it it shows that
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
you know a sense of Pride that the
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
product was produced and certified here
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
in the granite state if they're
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
certified by an outof State entity they
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
would no longer uh carry that logo that
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
logo would disappear from the
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh so I think um that reason
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
alone is is uh you know has market value
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
instead of carrying a logo from the
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
state of Maine or the state of Vermont
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
or Bay State in
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh so I think that is uh
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
how I'd answer that question I
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
representive K thank you madam chair and
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that and may maybe I didn't
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
hear that you're sit on the board of NOA
 
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.069 align:start position:0%
hear that you're sit on the board of NOA
New

New
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no okay I am on the policy and
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
education committee I served on the
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
national organic Standards Board so
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that's where the two got follow up
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for that
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
clarification my question is is no for
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont no for M you know mofa um they
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
all have their certifi organic farmers
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
in each of their respective States why
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
does not no for New Hampshire do the
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
same yeah and uh uh thank you
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative for your question um
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's been uh I I think there was some
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
background given earlier by a previous
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
commentator that they did years ago but
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
the department uh offered to work in
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
Partnership and provide the Professional
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
Service and then NOA New Hampshire could
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
education uh you know farm field days
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
events the winter conference and
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
delivering other services uh to The
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
Growers in the state with the Department
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
because they do other types of
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
certification it seemed like a natural
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
role for them to
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
fill thank you any other questions
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
speaking this morning um I'd like to
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
good morning and you've requested one
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
speak um my name is laa maias I'm here
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
representing Rosy's Garden the oldest
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
certified organic farm in the state um
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's vitally important to us to have
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
this certification program and for it to
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
continue to be affordable for Farmers
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
we're lucky that we have been able to be
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
certified since um the farm was founded
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
in the80s but not every Farm um has been
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
so fortunate awareness of eating
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
organically has grown over the years and
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
we've observed this firsthand in our own
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
um consumer base the number of people
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
who come in looking for specifically
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
organic products and our own organic
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
products has dramatically increased the
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
organic methods we use also benefit the
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
health of our soil water and help
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
mitigate the effects of climate change
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
and water contamination ation in our
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
community it's vital to our farm and
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
also our community to continue to be
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
certified organic and held to the
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
standards set by the New Hampshire
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
food we ask that you continue to make
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
this program affordable and accessible
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
to Farmers across the state thank you
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions seeing none
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate it like to call now do U
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Wolf from Newberry
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you've requested two
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.230 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you've requested two
minutes

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam excuse me Madam chairman
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
and members of the EG committee um I'm
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
going to speak a little bit and in
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
response to some of the questions that
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
were asked here and I have another bill
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
following this one um organic gives
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
consumers a choice it's an important
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
choice that they have that they
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
willingly make generally organic is more
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
expensive but people want to know where
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
their product is what it contains
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
Etc and they choose New Hampshire over
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
others because they know it's a fresher
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
product and it's locally
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
grown I have got had to go to the state
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
of Maine to get my poultry certified my
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
eggs because New Hampshire did away with
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
it two years ago and when I went into
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
spring ledge to deliver my eggs the
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
first first time and I had a state of
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
main logo on it the phone started
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
ringing and people asked what's the
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
matter you can't get certified in New
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are they stale eggs what's the
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
problem so we need to have a connection
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
to our own state to our own Agriculture
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
and yes I'm paying more money in Maine
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
I'm paying
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
$750 to certify egg production but I was
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
only paying 300 in New Hampshire and
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
that 300 has been fixed for the last 20
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
years I've been a certified producers
 
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
years I've been a certified producers
since

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
20 since 2000 so 24 years and this
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
program has existed since
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
1987 I'll speak further on uh 168 down
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
the road but it's important it's vitally
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
important to keep it going and not send
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
us packing down the road
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
dudy uh thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
representative why haven't the fees
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
changed uh was it put in statute and has
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate I I'm pausing because I don't
 
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.270 align:start position:0%
elaborate I I'm pausing because I don't
want

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
to say things that I shouldn't when it
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
was put in statue in 198 87 the word was
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
may have an organic program not shell
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the next bill that I'm
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
put it in would have put it in Statue as
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
a shell
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
program and when commissioner Steve
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
Taylor started the program and worked
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
with NOA to take it off of noa's hands
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
and have the state behind the
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
program I think there was a mistake made
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
and it didn't say shell it say May and
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
years there has been no fee increase I
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
can bring you the checks that I wrote
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
when my daughter was collecting eggs
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
back in the year 2000 and we're paying
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money I I may not be
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%

you maybe the inference wasn't there but
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
you seem to have alluded to the fact
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
that um with your main certification
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
people are assuming that your product is
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
from the state of Maine that's one of
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
the questions that I got asked how come
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
I had to change did I not pass New

chair as well because uh as a uh 7day
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
week uh certified organic farm I uh this
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
was my first opportunity to try to
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
organize my thoughts so please uh bear
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
with me uh my name is s bow and uh I'm
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
with kir sge cor farm and my parents
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
started the farm in 1981 and we've been
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
certified through the state of New
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 30 years uh if we can
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
remember to the beginning of the 2023
 
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.789 align:start position:0%
remember to the beginning of the 2023
growing

00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
season this was probably one of the
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
hardest growing seasons on New Hampshire
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
Farms that we've seen in the past
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
several decades now is not the time to
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
be taking these services that the state
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
provides away from the
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.309 align:start position:0%
provides away from the
farmers

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
and it is also not the fault of
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
certified organic farms in the state
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
that the fee structure has not been
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
addressed for the last almost 30 years
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
to take this program away from these
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
Farms on a very short
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
notice I think is disingenuous for what
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farmers deserve and for
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
what they need to survive uh a little
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
piece on that is we're very familiar
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
with working with the state of New
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we know the faces of the
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
certifiers I have their phone numbers in
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
my cell phone right now they're very
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
responsive if I reach out they get back
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
they help us to make sure that we go
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
through the Organic certification
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
process in a way that gets everybody
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
what they need and keeps our farm
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
certified uh and
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
another stressor on businesses and Farms
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
that we do not need right now after this
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
struggle of a growing season and looking
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
forward to try to increase our profits
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
and continue our business going uh in
 
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
the years to
 
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.630 align:start position:0%
the years to
come

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh the state in my opinion should be
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing programs that
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
address our mounting societal
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
issues and farms organic farms are
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
uniquely positioned to help us in a lot
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
of these uh issues that we're struggling
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
with with today the Mental Health crisis
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%

Supply the ability to help it is not a

solution to all of these crises but it
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
is it lends a helping hand in all of
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
these departments would we rather have
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
people having Mental Health crisis on
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
conquered main street or in the lettuce

field down on the back 40 where they
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
have friends and family around them we

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and again with with all of these
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
things it was the first time the
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic hit and everything
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
shut down it was the first time in my
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
life I was told that I was an essential
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
business and that people cared and they
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
wanted me to bring my employees to work
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
every day to make sure that the state
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
food supply wasn't in danger if you
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
remember the shelves at the market
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
basket and the Hannafords were bare for
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
a long time and if things had gone a
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
little bit worse who knows where we
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
could have been and maybe we would have
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
had to rely on New Hampshire Farms more
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
than we did but I glad that we were
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
there to help those people who needed us
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
did I think that the state should
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
actively help and not hinder businesses
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
who are are already currently on the
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
Forefront of many of these issues a yes
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill doesn't just show
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
support for organic agriculture as a
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
whole but it shows committed support to
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
its businesses its land its people and
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
its future there is no education level
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
skill set or professional career path
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
that excludes you from working on and
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire certified organic
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
farms thank you thank you
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
much uh now ask Sarah Hansen to come and
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%

01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
many both in terms of typical average

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
character providing funding for The
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
Organic certification program ensures
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
that Farms who provide the backdrop of
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
Agriculture for our state are receiving
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
the funding and representation they
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
require over the past decade of working
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
on a small farm the strongest connection
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
I have made with our state government
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
has been participating in our Organic
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
certification program there was a
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
question asked earlier about um the
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
difference between anopa certification
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the state certification and one of
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
the biggest differences that I see
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
and sow just alluded to this was that
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
the state provides certification right
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
now they do not provide and they're not
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to as a certifier provide
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
education or Community connections
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
between Farms if I go and I'm getting
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
certified and I say oh how do other
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
Farms do this my certifier is not
 
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to answer that question um
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's a really big service that NOA has
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
separately been responsible for
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
providing so I see the two entities
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
working in unison um I see the state the
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
organic certifier that comes to our farm
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
every year as my direct connection to
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
this state house and the values that I
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
hold as an organic farmer are
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
represented in in the state by the

1184 I'm a certified organic vegetable
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
grower because as a consumer in the
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
modern food food World navigating label

designations like allnatural or humanely
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
raised or sustainable I value clearly
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
defined certifications and real
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
accountability over vague terms that are
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
often intentionally misleading you
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
should ask me about how I grow your food
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
I'd love to tell you all about it we can
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
talk about cover cropping and compost
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
use and highly erodable land for the
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
next two hours but beyond our long and
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
overly detailed conversation everything
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
that I tell you about my growing
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
practices is backed up by my USDA
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
accountability in the 10 years that I
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
spent farming for other people and in
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
the 5 years that I've been farming as my
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
own business I have never experienced
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
such a challenging
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
season entering my third season as
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
certified organic by New Hampshire damp
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
I rely on the New Hampshire organic
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
brand to build local markets maintain
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
customer relationships and support the
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
growth of the organic economy in our
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
state losing Organic certification at
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
the state level would be the final blow
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
in a season of deep freeze devastating
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
rain and relentless
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
wind losing Organic certification at the
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
state level would be another instance of
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
wavering support for agriculture in New
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from our state government and
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
mistake we shouldn't be politicizing the
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
food that we eat agriculture in New
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could once again be a thriving
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
economy that supports the resiliency
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
health and financial well-being of our
 
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.750 align:start position:0%
health and financial well-being of our
local

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
communities you've heard from others
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
about the history of Organics
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
certification you've heard about the
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
growing economy of Organics nationally
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
but this is New Hampshire Beyond
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
National Data from the USDA what do the
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
numbers look like here in our
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
state here are some numbers for my own
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
Community 62% of my total organic
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
produce sales come from the Canan
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
farmers and Artisans Market serving the
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
Rural masoma Valley region in 2019 this
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
Market had an average of eight vendors
 
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
per week with almost no produce or other
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
agricultural products over the 19 weeks
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
of Market total vendors sales were
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
$25,000 that's
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
it I began vending at the Canan Market
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
in 2020 through Outreach marketing and
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
highquality vegetables I was able to
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
create a local following which brought
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
more of the community out to the farmers
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
market for weekly shopping in 2020 there
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
were an average of 16 vendors per week
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and over 19 weeks of Market total vendor
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
sales increased to
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
$667,000 yeah that was 2020 you're
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
probably thinking that the Boost in
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
sales and vendors was directly related
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic let's jump ahead and
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
take a look at the 2023 season one of
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
the rainiest seasons in recent memory
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
not great for an outdoor farmers market
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
right in 2023 the Canan Farmers Market
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
had an average of 25 vendors per week
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
and over the 19 weeks of Market total
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
$157,000 even on July 16th with tornado
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
warnings vendor sales totaled over
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
$10,000 for the day
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
this Market went from $25,000 in total
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
vendor sales in
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
2019 to 157,000 in total vendor sales in
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
2023 that small but important boost to
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
the economy of the masoma valley region
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
began with a tiny organic vegetable farm
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
supported by Organic certification
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
Services through New Hampshire
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
damp by preserving Organic certification
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%

place that people in this region can get
 
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
place that people in this region can get
organic

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
vegetables um organic vegetables it
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be Lebanon which is about um
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
depending where you are in the region a
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
30 minute or 45 minute drive
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
um in the other direction I'm not sure
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
Warner coner conquer excellent thank you

01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
questions um I I have a question I mean
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
I've heard several people come and um
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
talk about the importance and we we
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
can't underscore the importance of
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
organic farming in the
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
state um in so far as
 
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.990 align:start position:0%
state um in so far as
the

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
um availability for
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
program to certify organic farms in New
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you believe um the organic
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
farming Community is willing to support
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh with fees the program any program
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
that would be run by Department of
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
Agriculture in New
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire absolutely um I am a more
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
recently certified Farm I went through
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
the process in very recent memory um you
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
actually can't be certified by Vermont
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire they don't
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
have certification Services here I can
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
be certified by mafka which is Maine I
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
looked at their program um they offer
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
way more services to me me as a farmer
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
and it's more expensive um I would have
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
been very happy to pay those fees I am
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
only paying $150 right now that is not
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
why I decided to certify with the state
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I want to certify with
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because it's
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
my home and it's where I live and I feel
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
like we need more investment in
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
agriculture in general in our
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
state so just as a followup so if those
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
fees were raised in order for you to
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
support that program would you be okay
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
with that absolutely and I would be
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
willing to pay what other certifying
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
agencies ask I can't pay
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
you all right um I have one last pink
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
card thank you thank you very much and I
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in in this weather
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
to speak with us
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
today uh one last card uh is uh from uh
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Shan Jasper and Ellen Wyman
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
from our department of Agriculture
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
food director Wyman has a handout he'll
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
be passing out thank you and good
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for coming to speak
 
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for coming to speak
with

01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
morning I I will be primarily testifying
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh director Wyman's here to uh back
 
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
clean up if necessary and also to
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
provide any any other
 
01:09:55.159 --> 01:09:57.229 align:start position:0%
provide any any other
information

01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just for the record I am
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
Shan Jasper commissioner of the
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
food taking no position on the bill we
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
are happy to do whatever the legislature
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
wants us to do providing we are given
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
adequate Personnel to do
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
that um unfortunately though I think
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
this hearing has been come largely about
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
organic farming and support thereof
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
rather than what the bill is about is
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
which is providing us
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
funding um we should all support in my
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
opinion organic farming and I do not
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
believe that organic farming will be
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
negatively affected if this bill does
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
not not pass nor do I believe it will be
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
positively affected if it does this is
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
simply about who is going to do the
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
inspections you need to know that
 
01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
currently we are um in inspecting 66
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
Farms that are doing crops but there are
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
47 other Organic Farms who are being um
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
certified by eight other private
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
agencies so you know that's only a
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
difference of 19 we've talked about
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
supporting farms and again I think
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be put
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
into perspective according to the
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
USDA um there are over 4,000 farms in
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire whether you believe that
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
or not we're still talking about
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of people actively farming and
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
is 66 out of those those thousands so we
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
certainly uh think they're important the
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
question is a matter of
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
resources um you also I think should
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
know that besides New Hampshire out of
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
the other 49 states there are only 12
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
States who are doing any organic
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
certifications on the state level we
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
have been working with NOA New Hampshire
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
since late summer talking about this
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
possibility and what are the options to
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
have certification now we know that it
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
is important to Farmers perhaps to
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
Consumers as well to know that um the
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
product is being grown and perhaps even
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
certified in New
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however even if if Maine is
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
doing the certification these Organic
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
Farms do have the option of being part
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
of our uh New Hampshire seal of quality
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
program and so that could be part of the
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
labeling there's also nothing that would
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
prevent them to putting on putting on
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
their packaging or their sign something
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
saying New Hampshire
 
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.790 align:start position:0%
saying New Hampshire
groan

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
groan
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
um just again trying to put this into
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
perspective uh there was a mention about
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
fees yes we do need to increase the fees
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
no we would have no intention of
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
bringing them up to the to the total
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
cost we provided in the handout what
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
that would cost and the average ends up
 
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.629 align:start position:0%
that would cost and the average ends up
being

01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
$3,300 a
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
farm um as you can can also see in the
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
handout currently how many programs we
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
have and what are uh optional and what
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
are mandatory because organic is an
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
either your in or your out
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
proposition we have not been giv doing
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
Justice to the programs that we are
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
mandated to do that is a great concern
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to me and so that is why we are striving
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
to this point uh to try to get the
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
proper funding and Personnel now this
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
isn't just about the funding for us it's
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
about being able to guarantee to those
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
Farms we certified that we will be able
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
to do that you heard a little bit about
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
what happened when we withdrew from the
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
animal and processing part of organic
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
inspection that was really not a
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh situation for us it was
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
that we had lost certified people were
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
not able to do that um and we we gave
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
people a path forward with time and we
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
continue to do certifications to for
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
people until they could get somebody
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
else to do it but the problem is that
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
just too many requirements it takes
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
about 18 months to certify
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
somebody and currently we have two fully
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
certified people with one other who is
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
almost there and is doing inspections
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
but not fully certified
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
so looking at what would happen if we
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
lost two of those people and let me tell
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
you the organic inspector that we
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
lost um before was part of what led to
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
the crisis that we're in that person
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
went to another
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
certifier so you know it's very much
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
like what we're we're seeing in in many
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
other things the state trains somebody
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then they they move
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
on um and so if we lost two people we
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
would be done we'd have just a hard stop
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
and everybody would be scrambling to
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
find another certifier so in order to
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
recognize how much time we're spending
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
and you see that the director is
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
spending about
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
41% of his time on this voluntary
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
program and about I don't know
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's oh thank thank you director um
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of that's a lot of time and
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
again um what happens if we lose one two
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
people how do we do this this would give
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
us that buffer I would anticipate and my
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that everybody who works on
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
in the inspectional field would be
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
organic certified but this gives us that
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding so that then we can
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
also do the many other programs that we
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do and not doing well
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.189 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do and not doing well
um

01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
so I need to let you know that I've had
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
since I've become commissioner the
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural advis advisory committee
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
has given me one piece of advice and
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
that is they only support the
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
continuation of this program at
 
01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.189 align:start position:0%
continuation of this program at
100%

01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
100%
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency now that puts me in a
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
problem because that's not possible we
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
could not have fees that would support
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
this program we've given you the example
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
of what it would take within the handout
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
but that is something nobody would
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
support we've also then structured the
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
fees proposed changes to match uh Maine
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
and that's based on acreage again but
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the survey that we got
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
from uh NOA New Hampshire leads us to
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
the point where we believe that we would
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
lose many of the people we're currently
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
certifying even at that level based on
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
their survey survey and so that
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately we'd go from 15,000 to
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps the low 30s worst case
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
scenario um there is through the uh USDA
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
a program where organic uh Growers are
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for these fees up to
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
70 um 5% or
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
$750 whichever is greater so $750 is the
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
maximum that they can rece receive in uh
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh so it's really
 
01:18:03.639 --> 01:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh so it's really
not

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
um a great situation as we're looking
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
this and I'm trying to look to see what
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
my advisory committee has told me I'm
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
going against the advice of my advisory
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee by not proposing fees that
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
would fully cover the the
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
program um
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
so again people I think I did did say
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
that uh we could provide seal of quality
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
which would let people know that it was
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire product um so there are
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
other ways this is not about not
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
supporting it this is your your choice
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
we will do what you provide us the
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
funding to do but you need to go into
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
this with your eyes wide open have the
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
information you need and that's what I'm
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
trying to provide um but I I cannot
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
continue to do this Pro to provide these
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
Services if we do not have the funding
 
01:19:02.629 --> 01:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
whatever happens with this with this
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill we will continue to provide those
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
Services through the 24 growing season
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
at the expense of the other programs but
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
without the funding it will have to stop
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the 24 growing
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
season and so with that I be glad to
 
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
season and so with that I be glad to
answer

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you commissioner I I'm just
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
trying to connect the dots
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I believe that you said that these
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
two people will be a buffer in addition
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
to what you currently have cor correct
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
so we have three full-time people who
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
are engaging in this this would give us
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
a fourth and it would give us then a
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
fifth part-time person hopefully because
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
we looked at the hours we didn't get
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
greedy and say oh well it's a little
 
01:19:55.629 --> 01:19:55.639 align:start position:0%
over a person and a half we'll ask for
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
two we ask for what it takes to provide
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
the program now um and so this will give
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
us that would give us the buffer that if
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
a couple people left again we would have
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
to not do other things for a while but
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
we would always have enough people to um
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
to run this program unless everybody
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
left at once and obviously that's not
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
something we can ever plan
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
for follow follow
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
up okay so so you get four and a half
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
folks but you just testify that the
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
program goes away if you don't get this
 
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.629 align:start position:0%
program goes away if you don't get this
other

01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
1.5 and so the but you're currently
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
funded for the three people that's
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
currently in no no that is for the whole
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
inspectional decision division you see
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
on this on the sheets all that we're
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing the organ ANC
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
program and and you know we've talked
 
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.189 align:start position:0%
program and and you know we've talked
about

01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
1987 the requirements of the program
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
were not the same in 1987 as they were
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
today they continue to grow and continue
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
to grow and the federal government would
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
actually like states to be out of this
 
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.590 align:start position:0%
actually like states to be out of this
process

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
altogether so what I'm saying is we are
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
not currently doing what the legislature
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
has mandated us to do because if we're
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
in this program at all we can't do a
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
partial job we have to do a full job so
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm unwilling to continue to
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
do a May program at the expense of a
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
shell many shell programs and the only
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
way that I can uh fix that is to have
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
the additional Staffing okay I got it
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
sir okay representative
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
kulan thanks for taking my question um
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm curious why we can't um
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
contract out some of these positions
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
because from my vantage point it seems
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
like we're investing in training someone
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
and they're leaving to go to a private
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
certifier so wouldn't it be smarter to
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
just contract with the private person
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
and just say it's through New Hampshire
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's the complications the
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
NOP does not allow us to contract if I'm
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
recalling our discussions correctly
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
that I can't tell you be more expensive
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the funding so where
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
would we get this funding from I mean
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
you if they allowed it okay perhaps but
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
still who would we contract
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
with and how because I don't I don't I
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to go to another
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
certifying agency and they couldn't
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
contract with us we've had the
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
discussions but regardless there's no no
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
funding to do this I I just adds that
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
there there's no funding it would cost
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
more there is no funding at the moment
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
it would cost more and we've I've made
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
an attempt to try to pull people back
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
with the recent increase in in in state
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
employment uh you know we got a 10%
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
raise and all that I I can't pull people
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
back so you know it's a great thought
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
but but to to actually put that and
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
Implement that it doesn't seem realistic
 
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
from what I've been you know trying to
 
01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
from what I've been you know trying to
to

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish representative
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
Morris thank you um are you confident
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if you were to get the funding that
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to retain
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
employees no this is not about retention
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is about making sure that the pool
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
is large enough that I would not likely
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
lose enough people at the same time and
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's always a danger here because
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
again it's about an 18-month program but
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
but this is what we've been you know
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing there are no
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
guarantees this just gives me a large
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
enough pool that we should be able to
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
maintain the program and at the same
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
time be able to do the things that the
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you for taking my question
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
so how long has it have you been
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
operating in your current status without
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
having this expand
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
need I'm not sure
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
I totally understand the question let me
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
let me try to answer it and see if I get
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
so when I became
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner the former commissioner
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
told me that we were in triage mode with
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
everything and I soon found that out to
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
be very true so I have been trying to
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
figure out what our needs are within the
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
department and it has
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
been a couple of years years since I got
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
a hold of well you know the pandemic
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
interfered with everything but then the
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
director left and on the way out she
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
said you have to do away with animal Pro
 
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
animal and processing and then we really
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
began to dig into this with a new
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
director coming on board months later
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
and we've been looking at this so for
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
years and years and years we have not
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
been doing a lot of the things that um
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
we've been required to do some of them
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've gotten back on board to a small
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
degree but the uh the um feed testing
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
the fertilizer testing all those things
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're just doing a snippet of what we
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
doing follow
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
up so you're saying you're doing a
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
snippet of what's mandatory and then
 
01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.189 align:start position:0%
snippet of what's mandatory and then
you're

01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
doing you know another snippet of what's
 
01:25:45.719 --> 01:25:46.950 align:start position:0%
doing you know another snippet of what's
non-mandatory

01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh well no when it comes to the
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory on the
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
organic we you're all in or all out so
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have to do 100% of that then seal of
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
quality and the other program um the
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
Seal of quality what was the other one I
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
on there's uh good agricultural
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
practices country of origin labeling
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't do much with country of
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
origin uh good agricultural practices
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
again that's another one that you're
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
really in or out because that requires a
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
certification that program is self
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient that program there are
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
fees in that and that pays for itself
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
and then the Seal of quality is a
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
smaller program um doesn't take a a huge
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
amount of time one more one last sorry
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
so then my other question has to do with
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
what why was the last Financial audit
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
done in 2017 why hasn't there been one
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
since because uh from what I know an
 
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
agent bigger agencies may be audited
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
more often we are on a 10-year schedule
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
so the next audit is scheduled as I'm
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
walking out the door and we'll provide
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
the next commissioner with some
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
guidance representative Howard thank you
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair um the seal quality program
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
if um if we if you were to dis
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
discontinue the organic program would
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that would you be able to apply that
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
seal of quality program to those Organic
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
Farms I my understanding and director
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
Wyman can correct me if I'm wrong any
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
Farm regardless of whether or organic or
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
nonorganic organic can be part of the
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
Seal of quality program so they would
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
product representative Murray thank you
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
question uh my question is around just
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
um the frequency with which the Fe
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
structure might be Revisited in the
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
future um do you have
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
a a preference for how that would be
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
looked at seen as what we're looking at
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
at right now it looks like there are
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
some rather large adjustments that we're
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
looking at so if you could speak to
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
that certainly um the previous director
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know that was really under her
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
baileywick and during my first few years
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
she never came forward with that really
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that was on my radar
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
because there were so many so many
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
issues for instance when I came in we
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
had uh 38 authorized full-time positions
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
and we only had 32 of those positions
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
filled and so began looking on that
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
began looking at databases and pet
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
vending as you all know has been bane of
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
my existence and continues to be and so
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
this was something that nobody brought
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
to my attention and frankly I think as
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
most of you knew know the legislature is
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
very reluctant to give authority to a
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
department to increase fees most of
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
those are found in statute and so I
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't even actually
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
aware because we weren't looking at that
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
this was something we had the
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
ability excuse me to go to jalar uh
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
fees any other
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much commissioner
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%

you're discussing now
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
reflects what was done back in
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
1987 and I've talked to
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner former commissioner um
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%

Leon this was an in
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
attendent error
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill where I am

Miller Merl said that they expected this
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
program to be
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
continuing it wasn't a choice whether it
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
dropped it has been dropped three of the
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
four Scopes have now been
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
dropped so the only thing that is being
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
certified presently is
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
crops better than nothing I also certify
 
01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:27.189 align:start position:0%
crops better than nothing I also certify
my

01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
hay you cannot have a hard
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
stop the state did this two years ago
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
when they gave up handlers and
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
processors egg producers are called
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
handlers because they put it in a box um
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
we were given less than six weeks to
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
certifier I I think that the
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
legislature should be directing the
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to continue a program that
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
has been running for
 
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.149 align:start position:0%
has been running for
35

01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
years you cannot just give it
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
up and let the farmers go
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
away also just as an aside it is
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
comply with USDA NOP Etc and I
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
sympathize with director Wyman and
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper having to put up
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the federal
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
rules we talk about a
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
little certificate that says steal seal
 
01:33:42.239 --> 01:33:43.109 align:start position:0%
little certificate that says steal seal
of

01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
quality it's great I'd love to put it on
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
my egg things but you cannot put it on
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
an egg carton under NP rules there b if
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm certified as I am under mafka main
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
organic Farmers
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
Association I cannot put anything other
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
than the main seal on my thumb so what I
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
am asking very simply and I totally
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it is right to have
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because we've got a
 
01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because we've got a
program

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
going and that fiscal note should not is
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
part of this bill it's asking to
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
continue what we have been
 
01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.669 align:start position:0%
continue what we have been
doing

01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:34:28.679 --> 01:34:30.669 align:start position:0%
doing
for

01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
30 uh 1987 37 years almost 38
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
years very simple request to
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
change May to
 
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
Shell okay thank you any other questions
 
01:34:48.990 --> 01:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none oh
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so so the
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill as it is written
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh by just Chang that uh May to a
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
sha would require that all four Scopes
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
be uh be covered I don't believe that at
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
all okay uh so um if in the process of
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
reading the bill and getting uh advice
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
from um buers Etc we find that uh that
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
the by putting the sh there would
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
require that all four Scopes be covered
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
would you be amendable to an amendment
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
that would just make it go to crops I
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be and commissioner Jasper and I
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
discussed it I have prepared that
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment if that is the committee's
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
wish to uh go to to that because some
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
sort of Oro Organic certification is
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
better than none and commissioner Jasper
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
provided me with
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
um an amendment but I'm not prepared to
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
deliver it now until unless that's where
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
the committee's choice is okay so we're
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
going to be having a work this is an
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
informational uh we're going to be
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
having a work session on all of our
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
bills on the 30 31st first so uh maybe
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
you could provide that to us so that we
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
could include that in our deliberations
 
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
could include that in our deliberations
thank

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
you the 31st will be a work
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
session thank you I think that would be
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the time to present
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you any other
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%

01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
his primary testifier didn't show up
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
either so he was more than happy with
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro New
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm just going to kind of
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
summarize some of what I've written in
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
there because we've heard some of it
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
before um about the for Scopes uh that
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
this bill would uh mandate which would
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
be crops wild crops livestock and
 
01:38:14.199 --> 01:38:15.189 align:start position:0%
be crops wild crops livestock and
processing

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
handling um and each of these Scopes
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
require that the Personnel inspecting
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
and reviewing those files would be
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
trained for those particular
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
Scopes um and as we've heard in October
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
2021 the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
Agriculture damp stopped their Organic
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
certification for three of those scopes
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
for wild crops livestock and processing
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
handling and all of these operations uh
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
certified for these Scopes had to get
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
certified by another ACA within 60 days
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
I heard Dan representative Dan Wolf say
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
he had to do it within six weeks and the
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
department was is mandated also by law
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
by federal law to assist those uh
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
certifying operations to get certified
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
by another ACA this is not an easy task
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
the application process is lengthy and
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh new on-site inspections had to be
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
done inspections are mandated in the
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
federal law for annual inspection I
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
heard uh commissioner uh Jasper state
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
that it's an 18-month process this is
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
really a 12-month process
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
um but anyway to to have that
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
transferred to another certifier during
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
that short period of time was a big
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
hardship on these Farms New Hampshire
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms often grow crops they
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
raise livestock for meat eggs or dairy
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
products and have an on Farm Processing
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
operation to give added value to their
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
organic products I've already in my
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
three years of living here in New
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have already visited several
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
farms uh certified organic Farms um that
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
I buy product from and they have all
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
these types of Scopes that they need to
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
get certified by um for an example an
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
organic farm that's growing vegetables
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
and raising meat chickens and processing
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
those chickens they have to have
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
certification for all three of those
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
Scopes crops livestock and processing
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
and they pay the certification fees for
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
all three of these
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
Scopes um so by discontinuing these
 
01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:19.719 align:start position:0%
three Scopes the department has
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
decreased their fee income to fund this
 
01:40:24.109 --> 01:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
program considerably over the last
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
years um I would also state that I've
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
been in kind of involved in this with
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
NOA New Hampshire uh over the last year
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
and um the um NOP operates an organic
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
Integrity database that lists all the
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
organic farmers and the summer when I
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
was reviewing it there was about 132
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
Farms that were certified organic um uh
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of of New Hampshire but not
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily by
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
damp consequently in 2023 we have now
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
seen the number of certified operators
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
dramatically decreased to less than 70
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so discontinuation of those three
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
Scopes is partially responsible for the
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
pro the programs funding problems so for
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
that reason I feel like if you if the
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
department had a full program with all
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
four Scopes um they I support this um
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill that would reinstate accreditation
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
for their Organic certification thank
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions and I am a retired certified
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
organic farmer too okay thank you for
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
that okay appreciate you uh speaking on
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
that bill and now I am asking Jim Riddle
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
minute thank you madam chair members of
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
the committee Jim Riddle
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro uh and yes I'm speaking uh in
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
support of the bill as written uh and my
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is it would restore all
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
four Scopes um and that would make damp
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
a full service certification program and
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
as was previously mentioned uh many
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms operate more than just
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
crops they operate uh uh some Livestock
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
in addition or possibly on Farm
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
Processing and uh the discontinuation of
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
those Scopes has uh created upheaval for
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
those Farms additional costs additional
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
paperwork um and uh really damage the
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
long-term viability of damps Organic
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
certification program H and it's really
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
important when you're engaged in organic
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
agriculture that you're not just
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
operating alone you need essential
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
Services whether it's butchering or
 
01:42:59.550 --> 01:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
dairy uh processing cheese making seed
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
cleaning flower Milling Etc and the more
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
services that um damp can provide the
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
stronger position they'll be and the
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
better they can meet the needs of not
 
01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
just the organic farming Community but
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
all of the citizens of the State of New
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you questions
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I now ask
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:55.149 align:start position:0%
 
minute

01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you again for this opportunity and
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh my name's Nikki colb I'm the
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
operations director at NOA New Hampshire
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
we heard already about the impact of um
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Scopes that were dropped in 2021 and
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
the impact on farmers and The Organic
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
certification program as well as um
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
organic and the agricultural Economic
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
Opportunity of organic in the state and
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
Nation so we won't um go over that again
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh today the department of agricultural
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
markets and food is facing the possible
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
end of its Organic certification program
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
Al together which we have been
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
previously discussing representative
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
Wolf's Bill if passed ensures that the
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
department would be able to continue to
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
serve as an organic certifier for crops
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
now and into the future and could regain
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
all scopes of Organic certification
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
pending approval by the
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
USDA NOA New Hampshire supports farmers
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
who want new hampsh damp to continue as
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
an organic certifier for crops and other
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
Organic certification Scopes and no New
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also sees that New Hampshire
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
organic farming Community is growing if
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
passed hb1 1618 would signify to Farmers
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
and eaters that the state is willing to
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
invest in the agricultural sector long
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
term thank you thank you very much any
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
Bixby um so one thing that I'm uh
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
uncertain of is uh whether um if if we
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
passed the um the bill with a sha
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
language in it uh and that required all
 
01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
four Scopes to be uh to be handled by
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
the department but the department was
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
only certified to handle props by the
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
USDA would that create a um difficult uh
 
01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
legal conflict between the federal
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
government and the state
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
government I think that sorry um I think
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the department would need to seek
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
to extend their Cooperative agreement
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
for those other Scopes and that they'd
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to be in conversation with USDA
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
about it they previously decoupled and
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
took those Scopes away um I can't speak
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to the legal um question
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
that you asked but certainly they would
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
need to work with the USDA to add the
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
Scopes back with the Cooperative
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
agreement thank
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions seeing
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
none I
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
testify thank you madam chairwoman David
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
Trumble again um I won't repeat previous
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but I do want want to address
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
three things that have been raised first
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
is the question of can we Outsource this
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
without it affecting New Hampshire's
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
organic farmers and I got the impression
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
that that's what the commissioner said
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
was that whether you do or don't have
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
Organic certification it won't help or
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
hurt and I just don't agree with that I
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
feel strongly as I told you about the
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
history of this bill it was the
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture strong
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
commitment and support that saw this
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
program grow from eight farms in the
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
first year to almost 200 and we know now
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that there's still 132 about half
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
certified in state and half certified
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
out of state the Department's role is
 
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
essential to organic farmers you heard
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
organic farmers testify it's the number
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
one way in which they relate with the
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
state government to just say it can be
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
outsourced and it doesn't matter to me
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
is just not
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
quite the reality of How It's seen from
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
the farmer's point of view the second
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
thing is the commissioner said well
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's only 66 it's really
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
132 out of the 4,000 Farms but how many
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
dairy farms are there in this state when
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
I was young before I started my own
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
business I worked on dairy farms and
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
there was about 300 in the state and
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
they started dropping and dropping and
 
01:48:07.629 --> 01:48:07.639 align:start position:0%
dropping every time we lose one it's a a
 
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
catastrophe for the State of New
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think there's only a
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
little bit over a hundred left now so
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's about the same number of organic
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
farms in the state every single Farm
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
matters and counts and to say there's
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
only 132 organ farms in the state and
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a significant number I don't
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that it's an important number
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it's growing you heard about the top
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
program we have 15 Mentor mty
 
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
relationships I'm working with a young
 
01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
farmer uh down in the southern part of
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
the state there will be more organic
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
farmers coming and they'll be selling
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
directly to the consumer we should do
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
everything we can to promote those
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
Farmers not tell them that they're
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
insignificant and then the last thing is
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
the question about the fees um even if
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's an average of $3,300
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's at least four times higher than
 
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
the other states are finding it to cost
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
for this program so I don't understand
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
why it costs so much for New Hampshire
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
to certify when Maine can do it for so
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
much less but again I go back to my
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
original point the if you put this all
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
on the farmers there will be nobody left
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the program in two or three years
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
it'll be not eliminated legislatively
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
but through fees it it won't exist so I
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
urge you to do the turn it from May to
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
Shell have the government do it but make
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
sure that you also keep the funding high
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
enough so that the farmers can
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the program thank
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
you so I have a question for you yes M
 
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman so then you believe that
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
um excuse me you believe that the
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
farmers would be unable themselves to
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
sustain this program by the
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
fees yes the paper that just went around
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
to you um Mr Wyman showed me a copy of
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
it my Farms fee would go up to
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
$6,200 under that program if I could do
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
it for 1,400 in Maine it would make no
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
sense I don't make enough money to pay
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
extra $5,000 for the same service and I
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't counsel my young
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
mentee farmer to sign up for New
 
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it would be he just he
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do it either the
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
program would would vanish so then as a
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
followup then you believe that that the
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
whole of uh New Hampshire taxpayers
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
should subsidize this program for the
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
organic farmers in the state that's a
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
great question um it's not subsidizing
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
it for the organic farmers the organic
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
farmers do what they do every day as a
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
as a um workers who benefit the state
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
this organic farming is environmentally
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
friendly farming we strengthen the
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
economy as I said earlier it's at least
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
at least $10 million probably at least a
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
thousand workers tens of thousands of
 
01:50:57.629 --> 01:50:57.639 align:start position:0%
Acres it's not you're subsidizing the
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
farmer the farmer is doing work that
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
benefits the community and in reality
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
that fee benefits to the community and
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
look at every other program the
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture runs if we can
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
Outsource anything and it doesn't matter
 
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
then why why don't we apply that same
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
analysis to every program the department
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
does I I don't see why the organic
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
farmer is particularly said well you can
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
Source you don't
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
count okay thank you oh you're welcome
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it has
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
to do with this question about how do we
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
how we Define this outlay of funds right
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a subsidy or the term I
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
believe you used to testimony the
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
previous bill was an investment and I
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could speak to the ways in
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
which that's what this is right I mean
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh when we
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
experienced the example of uh not having
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
food on the shelves in our supermarkets
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
for example uh during the covid pandemic
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
right part of that is because of Supply
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
chains because we're relying upon food
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
brought from from great distances and
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
growing elsewhere so that seems to me an
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
obvious example of where this is an
 
01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
investment on food Security in New
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but could you speak to the
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
ways in which this outlay of State funds
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
is an investment that benefits the
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
entire State thank you representative
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
Jam um so you just indicated it's food
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
on the shelves it's it's employees
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
people who work on the farms every time
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
you spend a dollar locally you get a
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
three times multiplier at least so you
 
01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
support a local organic farm that farm
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
is hiring local people they're buying
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
local that money stays in the economy if
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
that farm doesn't exist all that money
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
is going to a grocery store that's
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
buying something from out of state the
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
environment is important I I have never
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
felt like we want to turn this into
 
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
organic versus conventional Farmers from
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
day one I felt like that was the wrong
 
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
approach for organic so I don't want to
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
go there but I just want to say that
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
organic farmers practices by rule have
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
to be environmentally friendly so that's
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
another benefit that that that applies
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly the organic farmers I
 
01:53:00.189 --> 01:53:00.199 align:start position:0%
feel have been because we can't use
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
herbicides we've had to come up with
 
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
different ways to deal with the problems
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
that every other farmer faces so when I
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
started the the way you controlled weeds
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
was with your tractor with sweeps and
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
shovels you drove over the crops with
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
your tractor and you kind of killed the
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
weeds but organic farmers came up with
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
all these really creative ways to deal
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
with all these different different types
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
of cultivators including flame weed and
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
spider weeders and that got adopted by
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
farmers who are not organic and now the
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
young Farmers have said well you know
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
what I've seen tarps being used on home
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
gardens let's expand that so they're
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
using these giant 100 by 200 foot tarps
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
putting them out on the field for three
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
or four weeks it kills the weeds
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
germinate they die they don't go in and
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
plow and Harrow they plant right into it
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
because anything that was germinable is
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
below that surface level they that gives
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
them a head start if you're spraying
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
herbicides you got a three-month head
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
start on the the weeds you can grow a
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
crop so organic farmers are working in
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
all different kinds of ways they are
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
benefit to the state I just think we
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
should be treated like all the other
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
Farmers it started as a small little
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
thing but they worked and worked and
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
worked to get a seat at the big table
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
and I think we should keep our seat at
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
the big
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
table thank
 
01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
you okay appreciate it thank you um call
 
01:54:12.199 --> 01:54:14.229 align:start position:0%
you okay appreciate it thank you um call
Tim

01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
Tim
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
me it's meeh that's right you got it
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:21.229 align:start position:0%
right thank
you

01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members of
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm just going to speak
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
about our farm uh is this in relation to
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
this Bill yes in relation to
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
Bill okay 1816 because we need to speak
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
about um whether or not we want to make
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
this um from a May to shall in in the
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
language of uh the current statute so
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
can you I'm in favor of the of doing
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so I just have a quick statement to
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
read sure so here at North Family Farm
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
in Canterbury we became certified
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
organic by the state of New Hampshire in
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
2005 we worked with Vicki Smith and
 
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
Janice Connor through the
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
program W though the program was
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
relatively new to the state the
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
inspectors did good work on the ground
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
level and helped the producers they were
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
inspecting through their committed work
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
we as Farmers felt supported not only by
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
the inspectors but by the state
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
with the pressures on farmland for
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
development we need the state to
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
continue to support and promote the
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%

fill our orders of the custom printed
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%

labels thank you very much thank you any
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'd like to call
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%

the committee for the record Rob Johnson
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
representing F
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
Bureau and
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill as the language just
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
striking May to
 
01:57:30.669 --> 01:57:30.679 align:start position:0%
Shell our policy is to support a a a
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
self uh self- sustaining self-operating
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
program but but and there's a big butt
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a a program that is very
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
important to a number of our Farmers as
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's Central to the way they
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
farm and with you as you all have
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
previous testimony you've heard there's
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
a hard stop to the program a few years
 
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
back and we think the program needs a
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
real chance and given that it it it can
 
01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.910 align:start position:0%
real chance and given that it it it can
become

01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
self-supporting what would ask is that
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
you do fund the program as the previous
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
Bill uh provided but Sunset
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
it give it three
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.229 align:start position:0%
it give it three
years

01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
open it up so that it's it's it's uh uh
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
categories the the the farmers are going
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
to have to realize with that there's
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a fee
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
increase so that it's on par with moffa
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
and Bay State and you know Vermont NOA
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
those are are are bordering states and I
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
think they also the community needs
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
needs to get on board and go to those
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
that are currently out of state being
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
certified from out of state and say you
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
know if you if we are going to maintain
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
a program in New Hampshire you need to
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
come back or you've need to come to New
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that all that needs time
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
so I think if if you and the legislature
 
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole if you decide to do that it
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
will give it a but again because of the
 
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
hard stop and what they've been through
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh it it it gives it a chance and we
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
think in that way it it can it is
 
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
important enough and I think it's
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
important not just to our Farmers but to
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and and in CL thing
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
I just I do want to say is that our
 
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
policy for for supporting a a
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and self-sustaining uh
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
program is is like the commissioner said
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that the
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
department currently isn't doing isn't
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
able to do because of of of all their
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and you you the
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner touched on fertilizer
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
testing that's something that's been a
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
big one for our folks uh we just just
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
met the other day with him and you'll be
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
hearing more about it is relative to
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and and how they are not
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
being pleased as needed because again
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
the agency just doesn't have the
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
resources so again in closing please
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
provide provide the funding Sunset it
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
give the program a chance and I I'll
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
close with that and always thank you for
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
your uh attention and and and
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you representative
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
Katon I'm sorry I I lost it you said you
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
oppos the bill does that mean that you
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
oppos the bill we we oppose a change in
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
the language of of of um because if but
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
we would ask that you provide the
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
funding to Sunset for a period of say
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
call three years okay thank you yet the
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
the other excuse me if I may Madam chair
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that I intended to
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
mention also um
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
the I think what would like right now
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
the way the the word it's worded such
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
that it's a May program with the US
 
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and there's no
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
consideration there as has been previous
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned a contract out or work with
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else and would eventually at
 
02:00:54.669 --> 02:00:54.679 align:start position:0%
some point like to see that that uh
 
02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
piece changed and I know I know with the
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
the director said but I that's the first
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
I've heard of it that there it doesn't
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
seem to be the the uh uh feds do do not
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
approve of of of Contracting and i' I
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
guess I'd like a little more information
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
on that thank you any
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh representative
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
Bixby Sor I'm a little bit confused
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
about um what you're talking about
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
sunsetting would that be part of 1618 or
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
part of 1184 we about merge them both
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
the sunset I'm talking about the program
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
in general it's hard to separate with
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
these bills as to they're all they're so
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
very similar but it would be the the the
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the well the program in general the
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
hope would be that after that period it
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
would be funded in if it's making
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
bringing in adequate funds then uh the
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
department would be able to and and to
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
to to continue
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
Howard so just a point of clarification
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
so if you you're saying I subsidize it
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
for until it sunsets and then not don't
 
02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
replace it with anything or correct
 
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
State goes out of out of the business of
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
certifying at least it would give the
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
program a chance again the the the that
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
was like like uh the sponsor said that
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
was a hard stop a couple years back that
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
was real challenging difficult and not
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
fair to to the participants in the
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
program and at least this allows them
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
some time to one for fees to be
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
increased going to a full program and
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
then allowing them to get like I said to
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
get out into the organic community and
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
say look you folks that are in New
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are participating on the
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
state well if we're going to have a
 
02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining program in New Hampshire
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
we need you and I don't think that's
 
02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.390 align:start position:0%
we need you and I don't think that's
been

02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
attempted okay representative um
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
bman thank you and get used to that yeah
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
this is my first time speaking in
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee so you know let me know if I'm
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
doing it right congratulations you're
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
doing fine okay thank you um so my
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
question and if you're not the right
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
person I apologize but previous speaker
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned um something about the
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
non-organic farms and I'm R wondering if
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's anyone who knows in this state
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
what kind of subsidies or support
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
financial support the non-organic
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
farmers are
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
getting I think for the most part both
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
get the same when you're speaking
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
specifically organic yeah there are
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
there a few things that they they uh are
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
eligible for Rel relative to their
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
certification cost and that having
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
there's some cost share with the USDA
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
but for the most part I don't it's I
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
would say the the both whether you're
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
organic or non you're you're getting the
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
same availability of programming whether
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
it be state or federal so followup
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
followup sure so so then the the
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
nonorganic Farms aren't getting any
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
other kind of additional funding in any
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
way or any other kind of additional
 
02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.870 align:start position:0%
way or any other kind of additional
support

02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
for what um anything really just
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are other places that
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
anything any different than an organic
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
farmer would be getting okay yeah yeah
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
maybe to clarify a little bit maybe it's
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
more to the root of what you're asking
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
is that the organic program is a
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
marketing program that's not mandatory
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's the difference
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
why some would say that why is the
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture doing it and
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
was a choice that was made you know by
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
the by the department years ago um to to
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
to become a
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
certifier I know I'm not answering
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
question clarify there's it's more the
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
marketing though right I mean it's it's
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
different practices in in the program
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
practices but as far as I think from a
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
state point it's it's Perman it's a
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
marketing program that's what it
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
is okay thank you thank you
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if instead of of
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
sunsetting the program and facing the
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
possibility there's a cliff then that we
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
fall off it seems to me there's a lot of
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussion today that this isn't the
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
right fee structure to begin with so I
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why it wouldn't make more
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
sense rather than sunsetting and facing
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
the possibility of a cliff we look at a
 
02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:08.679 align:start position:0%
three-year period and we talk about how
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
to restructure the fee structure so that
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
if the program is more successful and
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
fees are increasing on the part of our
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
organic farmers it's also decreasing the
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
amount that the state is contributing
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
but the state is still continuing to
 
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
invest money so why is uh that not a
 
02:05:28.109 --> 02:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
preferable solution to revisit the fee
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
structure yeah well I I think I
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that it certainly does
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
need to be uh the the and commissioner
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
can correct me but I think the numbers
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
he provided you when I miss I walked in
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
just as this this hearing was starting
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much that that number of was
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
$6,000 per farmer as it would currently
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's basically just the current
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
participants based on what he
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
anticipates the cost to be that's not
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
without anybody I don't know if that's
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
really inaccurate I know what he was
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
getting at but it's not there'll be more
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
participation if it's a full program
 
02:06:01.229 --> 02:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
it's not just crops and and that type of
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
thing um it's one and I guess I wouldn't
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
agree that it's a cliff a probably a
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
cliff was though the like like the
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner said the department did
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
find sponsors but it was a it was a very
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
quick turn around if it's if it's known
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that it's suns setting I
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
think that puts everybody's feet to the
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
fire and you know in three years or five
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
years or whatever you determine to be
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
but there's got to be a point where the
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
program becomes self self- sustaining
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
and in that's our policy that's what our
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
our members have
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
voted representative
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
Morris thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um are all of the
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
farming um programs self- sustaining at
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
this point or is it a goal for them all
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
to be no they're not but again we're
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
looking at this it's a marketing program
 
02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
as op
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
optional as a farmer I I can I can go to
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
I can go to Maine I can go to Vermont I
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
can go to Massachusetts to a certifier I
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
understand but it it sounds like we're
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
hearing that um it's very important to
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
the organic farmers that they are
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
certified in New Hampshire and so I'm
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering if it's um really more
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
than a marketing tool for them because
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the practices that they're using then
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
why would we want them to be self-
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
sustaining when other farmers are not
 
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
required to
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
be I would disagree with the where other
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
farmers are not required to be I don't I
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't understand that I mean the other
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
duties of the of the agency are you know
 
02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
relative to Animal Health and Welfare
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
which you know uh relative to uh
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
consumer protection you know making sure
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
when I purchase a product I'm getting
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
what I paid for whether it be oil
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and that type of thing um
 
02:07:51.390 --> 02:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um people that that uh use
 
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
pesticides and we all use pesticides
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
whether you're organic or not you know
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
when you apply a product to something to
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
kill it you are using a pesticide
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a chemical or
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
not the the you know the agency is is
 
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
overseeing that program I'm trying to
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
think of an example off the top of my
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
head as I'm in front of you um and I you
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
know the the uh um the benefits of the
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
ACT development program are support all
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers getting people out to Farms
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
providing listings uh you know the the
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
plant health inspection type is you
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're inspector whether you're
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
organic or not
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah again this I think this is is
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
unique however you want to qual quantify
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
it qualify it I I'm not going to
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
disagree it is a little more more than a
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
marketing program but essentially for
 
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
our purposes here it is a marketing
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
program and I know people will disagree
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
on with me all members on both sides of
 
02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
the issue we do it's a it's a tough one
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
within Farm Bureau but but as a majority
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
of our members ship this is our our
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
position and we we really are again I
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
want to stress that as I said earlier
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
and the commission commissioner said it
 
02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that the
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
agency currently isn't doing that needs
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be done and I I we understand that
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
challenge and and as he said the a huge
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
Challenge and I probably the director
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
spoke to it earlier is just the the
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
ability of them to maintain the the
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
educational requirements of the
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
inspectors how that's changing and there
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
been more burdens on that so we
 
02:09:16.119 --> 02:09:17.310 align:start position:0%
been more burdens on that so we
understand

02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
that okay representative Bixby yeah so
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still a little bit confused
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
about what's getting sunsetted are you
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
talking about sunsetting the entire
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
inspection program or just sunsetting
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
the uh additional the the funding above
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
the fee levels well if
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
funding maintain the bill as is
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
requiring then sunet the program if
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
that's it so so are you thinking that we
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
should that the department should get
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
out of the certification process alog
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
together in three years no my hope no my
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
again the hope is give the program a
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
chance fund it and I I I think it could
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
be self-sustain we think it could be
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
self- sustaining self- funding if it
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
again if it's given the proper chance
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
represent bi so um but if it's not then
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes get out of it so uh the so we can
 
02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
only do funding with bani and by B I so
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the uh issue of providing
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
funding for future years actually be a
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
decision for feature legislatures it it
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
it it would be I can't no legislature
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
can bind another I understand that so so
 
02:10:35.549 --> 02:10:35.559 align:start position:0%
in that in that case the question of the
 
02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
sunset might not actually matter because
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
um we the the pro that that that b
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
budget process would actually create an
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
automatic Sunset yeah I would I would
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
yes I would hope if the program um U
 
02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh if funding wasn't provided then then
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
there would be some accommodations and
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
recognition of that going forward by the
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
future legislators okay so um but just
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
sort of just getting back to like what
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
we need to do right now it might not be
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
necessary to write a sunset into either
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
of these bills in the way that we deal
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
with them because the the budget process
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
would event essentially deal with that
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh funding uh Sunset automatically I
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
suppose if it were okay right thank you
 
02:11:29.599 --> 02:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
suppose if it were okay right thank you
written

02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
correctly okay any other
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Johnson and I now
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
Jasper two to three minutes and we're
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
running very
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
late good
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon I wonder if any of you could
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
see the steam coming out of my ears in
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
the back of the
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
room um so I am in opposition to the
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill first of all yes there was a hard
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
stop on the processing in animals it was
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
not six weeks it was more like six
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
months the letter and I can show it to
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who doubts me said within six
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
weeks you have to identify to the NOP a
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
certifier who may be able to certify
 
02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
certifier who may be able to certify
your

02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
program so we were letting people know
 
02:12:33.390 --> 02:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
that they had six months to find
 
02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
somebody they didn't even have to have
 
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
an agreement with anybody just who could
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
come and do the inspections that's what
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
they needed in six weeks we continued so
 
02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
most people had at least 6 months until
 
02:12:45.079 --> 02:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
most people had at least 6 months until
their

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
certification was done we had some
 
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
people within that period we were able
 
02:12:53.549 --> 02:12:53.559 align:start position:0%
to continue to certify them so then they
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
had another year so the department
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
really got bashed on that and that was
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
totally unfair because nobody had six
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
weeks to get somebody to certify them so
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing that brought the
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
steam out of my ears it does require all
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
Scopes as representative Bixby has
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out I did work with
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh wolf to come up with
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment which he's chosen not to
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
give you you also heard oh it only takes
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
12 months to certify somebody that is
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
true if that is your primary job I am
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
not hiring people to just do Organics so
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
to have them do other work which they're
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
required to do it takes 18 months to get
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
them there in the department because
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
this is not the only thing we
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
do um loss of Revenue yeah was there a
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue when we stopped sure
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
sure but why did we lose that Revenue if
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
you recall in the fiscal not is on this
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill to do all of what is asked to be
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
$88,000 so the loss of Revenue was
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
insignificant the problem is we do not
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
have the budget I wish everyone would
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
stop talking about fees fees are totally
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to any of the bills that
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today I couldn't
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
care less if we bring in a dollar of
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's your job to worry about
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
if you want me to do all these for free
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly happy to do it but I can't
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
do it without the 220,000 in the first
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill or the
 
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
88,000 in this bill so the fees just go
 
02:14:38.549 --> 02:14:38.559 align:start position:0%
to the general fund I don't care overall
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture if you
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
take away our grant programs and our
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
cost of care fund anything to do with
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations I am one of the
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
few I run one of the few net positive
 
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
we do not require a general fund
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation to run the Department of
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
Agriculture we turn back $200 to
 
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year on our operations back
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the general
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
fund so this isn't about why what
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
services are you providing most people
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money for what
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing but the state has made
 
02:15:25.149 --> 02:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
choices like for the dairy program to
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
provide services so that people can sell
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
milk fine I don't care there's not
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue with that you can provide this
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
service to Organics without fees I don't
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
care I cannot do it without people and
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
this again you want to talk about a hard
 
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
stop I get two resignations today you
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
have a hard stop without any warning
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
without anything and there's nothing I
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
can do about it you want to put this
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill in As I Shall fine it's not going
 
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
to make any difference to me because if
 
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have the Personnel I'm not going
 
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to do what I can't do and
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
somebody can take the state of New
 
02:16:03.629 --> 02:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to court for not doing it but
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that will be because you didn't
 
02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate the necessary amount of
 
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
money for the Department of Agriculture
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
to do it and I'm sorry if I'm sounding
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
angry to you folks I'm not I'm angry
 
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
about this discussion because I've been
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking till I'm blue in the face about
 
02:16:20.189 --> 02:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
about it either appropriate the money or
 
02:16:21.629 --> 02:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
don't we'll worry about the fees if you
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
want to have any later or take the fees
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
care representative
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I hope this doesn't
 
02:16:36.509 --> 02:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
raise your blood pressure any higher but
 
02:16:39.389 --> 02:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
I have to ask this question uh I mean I
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
keep hearing over and over again that
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's a funding problem a funding
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
problem and if there is a funding I mean
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
a resource problem a resource problem
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
then then why is the department a not
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
asking for more money and B why are you
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
sending money back to the general fund
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
if you need more resources
 
02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:04.599 align:start position:0%
so as as a former legislator I know one
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing don't get greedy you get nothing I
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
have been building this department up
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
over the the last few few budgets we got
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
new positions this
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
year this was something that anybody
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
could have put money in this is a May
 
02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
program that is not my priority to fund
 
02:17:28.509 --> 02:17:28.519 align:start position:0%
over the other needs I have prioritized
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
the needs if I didn't have any other
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
needs I would do that I would also say
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
that for me personally
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
88,000 for 66 people with private
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
options out there is not something that
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
I say is something we should be doing
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
but we have many other
 
02:17:51.309 --> 02:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
issues in the department and I'm fine to
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
do it but I've always said this is a
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
legislative decision because it's not a
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
department priority it's not something
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
that has caused us to
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
um have a real hole other than the fact
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
that this last year I said and
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's been part of
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
these discussions and I appreciate that
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
if we do not get the funding the program
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
will stop
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
so that's not much different than me
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
asking for it in the
 
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
budget and it that's the
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
reality represent pix yeah so um it
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like uh more important than the
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
$800,000 B change in the fiscal note for
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
this if this bill were to go forward
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we' really need to do is authorize
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
that increase in
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
positions that that is correct and I
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
will tell you again I do not believe
 
02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
that NOP will allow us to go back and
 
02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
start doing the other things and we
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do that just because of the lack
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
of funding that was part of it we were
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
not meeting their standards and we
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have the Personnel to do it we
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't have the time to bring
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
them on we didn't have a choice and this
 
02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
was about not putting organic farmers
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
and processors at risk for losing their
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
certification that's my number one
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
concern in all of this all of this my
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
number one concern is that our organic
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
farmers do not wake up one day and find
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
out that we have failed and that they
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
are not certified and they lose that
 
02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
certification whatever you do I want to
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we're going to do it
 
02:19:48.309 --> 02:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to guarantee that
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
and if you're not going to give me the
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
people to do that then I'm not going to
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
do it so that we have a year
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
transition so that they know where they
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
can go I'm glad to work with them as I
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
have been with NOA New Hampshire to find
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
some paths to to see how we get that New
 
02:20:10.349 --> 02:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certification on there this is
 
02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
not about I support Organics I think
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is very very important so important
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
that I do not want to put them at
 
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
risk follow representa oh well okay
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
follow up represent Bixby and then
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
represent T so um so even if we did
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
authorize eight POS eight positions
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that the NOP would
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
reop our certification to those that is
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
correct because as I told you I you know
 
02:20:44.349 --> 02:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
people talking about moving forward I
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
think what you're looking at is a few
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
years down the road there will be no
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
States certifying because then we can
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
get into the business of giving advice
 
02:20:56.190 --> 02:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
and and help um but this is just not
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
something that the feds um want to talk
 
02:21:00.750 --> 02:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
to I also want to talk about a little
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
bit and I appreciate um what Rob Johnson
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
had to say we've had insanely low fees
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
for years and yet there were still other
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
people who didn't want to hop on and be
 
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
certified by us
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
so if they were not willing to jump on
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and be certified by us now and if we're
 
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
if we do raise the fees which it's at
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
least responsible for me to bring a
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
proposal forward why would they come on
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
with increased fees so I just people
 
02:21:38.910 --> 02:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
have make decisions for a variety of
 
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
reasons and those others who could be
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
certified as chosen not to I don't think
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's anything we can do to get them
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
fenza so just while you were talking I
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
was just kind of searching up through
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Agriculture their um their database
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is the organic certifiers uh
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
profile and and there's a ton in there
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
so why not is is is that not an option
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe it kind of piggybacks on what
 
02:22:12.349 --> 02:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative kulon was asking why not
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
have so for example NOA New Hampshire
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
why couldn't they be the certifying
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
agency because I mean just on looking in
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
this database here's one right here Bas
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
State organic certifiers they're right
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
here in in Massachusetts so why couldn't
 
02:22:31.389 --> 02:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
they be the certifier and then that it
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
the burden is taken off of it's New
 
02:22:35.469 --> 02:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based but the burden is taken
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
off of the state they're they're facing
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
the same problem that we're facing
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
resources okay right now they don't have
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
from what I'm told the resources to do
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
this now you've also heard that fees are
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
are lower in in other states even with
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
private wise would ours be so high what
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
I am told is that you know all of these
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
organic organizations have memberships
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
they have fundraising and part of that
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
goes to offset the fees um that they
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
charge to do the inspection our offset
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be general fund money I can't go
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
out there and fund raise for a
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
inspection fee reduction um in New
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think the ideal thing is for
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
there to be a New Hampshire based
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
inspection whether it's no for New
 
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or if they can work out
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
something now one of the problems
 
02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
and um director Wyman didn't recall but
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
as I sat there I did think about this we
 
02:23:42.429 --> 02:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
had said well what if you know we
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
contracted with
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
somebody NOP said no we can't the the
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
person who does the inspection it has to
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
be their certification on the label we
 
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
cannot certif we cannot go out so that's
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
option yes
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative follow I did yeah can I
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
just have a quick followup a quick
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
followup we are running out of time here
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
so all right it's fine I'll talk to him
 
02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
after go ahead
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair I'll make
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
this very quick first of all I
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Clarity around what it
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature is supposed to
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
do to provide you with the resources you
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
need to do your job so I I want to thank
 
02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
you for that because I think that's an
 
02:24:32.590 --> 02:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
excellent point uh do what is your view
 
02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner around the idea of
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
changing the fee structure so in that
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
case you know we can have more
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
especially hopefully as the program is
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
successful more of it paid for through a
 
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
change fee structure which would help to
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
at least uh reduce some of the resource
 
02:24:51.469 --> 02:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
requirements on the
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
department well my my personal feeling
 
02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
is and obviously a unanimous vote of the
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee which did include um
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
former commissioner Taylor who I believe
 
02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion is the feeling of
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee this should be
 
02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient the reality is it will
 
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
not be cannot be unless we had hundred
 
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people in this program
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's also how some states are able to
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
do it they have more in in I'm not I
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say States organizations
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
because all other than a few States
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
they're all private organizations and if
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
we had 200 you know growers in here our
 
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
fees to be self-sufficient would be uh
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
lower just like our Gap is
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient because of you know
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
their the number of farmers
 
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
participating in it so this is a a
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
matter of scale but as I say to me it
 
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter you can provide this as a
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
free service if you want to because
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's not my my job my job is to
 
02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
provide the service and to do that I
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
need the resources and you need to worry
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
about whether you want to give that
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
amount of money to a program what I am
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
what I am told for every dollar of State
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh money available there are $3 worth of
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
requests so you have to prioritize not
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
my job not
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you very
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
much okay any other questions thank you
 
02:26:33.230 --> 02:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for your patience
 
02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for your patience
and

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%

have the blue sheets for uh HP 1618
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
and and I just say the online testimony
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
was 30 in support of uh HB 1618 and one
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
here we have five people signed in in
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill I'm going to close
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
out hb1 168

1578 and um I had a conversation with
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill this is not an
 
02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:29.429 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill this is not an
early

03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%

03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everybody
 
03:07:51.630 --> 03:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open up the hearing for
 
03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:53.550 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open up the hearing for
HB

03:07:53.550 --> 03:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
1182 adding certain equin practices to
 
03:07:58.750 --> 03:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
the definition of animal
 
03:08:01.229 --> 03:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
cruelty and with us today is
 
03:08:04.510 --> 03:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed to introduce this
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Madame chairwoman and
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
03:08:13.309 --> 03:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent new Mar Market in
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
newfields which is rocking
 
03:08:18.670 --> 03:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampton um I have been what you might
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
call an equestrian for 14 years I uh was
 
03:08:25.830 --> 03:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
formerly trained at UNH in Dr and
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
jumping and since then since about 2012
 
03:08:29.479 --> 03:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
jumping and since then since about 2012
I've

03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
I've
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly uh Trail ridden uh but
 
03:08:36.190 --> 03:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
also a little bit of mounted archery so
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
it um everything horse related is
 
03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
something near and dear to
 
03:08:44.349 --> 03:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
me um before you today is a bill that
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
would add four common but pretty
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
atrocious and I think you will probably
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
agree equin practices into the
 
03:08:56.190 --> 03:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
definition of animal
 
03:08:59.550 --> 03:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
cruelty um they all four practices are
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
universally condemned by the American
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association and the
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
American Association of equin
 
03:09:10.110 --> 03:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners um all of four of these
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
practices are used explicit
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
exclusively for competition purposes in
 
03:09:18.910 --> 03:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
order to score higher in competitions
 
03:09:21.229 --> 03:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
all four of these practices are grounds
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
for disqualification and yet all four of
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
these practices are pervasive according
 
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Agriculture the
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Agriculture
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
because there is a culture of Silent
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
acceptance that these are the ways
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
people win blue
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
ribbons so in general just so you know
 
03:09:42.670 --> 03:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
there are many different horse breeds
 
03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
each breed much like any other animal
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
has a confirmation expectation of how
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
that horse will look and move and they
 
03:09:52.990 --> 03:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
are judged accordingly even though a
 
03:09:55.710 --> 03:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
horse may be bred with certain qualities
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
in the show ring it is often um
 
03:10:01.510 --> 03:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
exaggerating those qualities that winds
 
03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
blue ribbons artificially exaggerating
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
those qualities so the four practices I
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
will explain uh as briefly as possible
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
the first one and I have a handout
 
03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
before you it was stapled kind of in
 
03:10:16.349 --> 03:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
reverse order so if you go to the last
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
page the first practice is hoof
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
soaring which by the way has been
 
03:10:24.269 --> 03:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
illegal on the federal level since
 
03:10:27.269 --> 03:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
1970 uh hoof soaring happens
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
predominantly in Tennessee Walker horses
 
03:10:32.469 --> 03:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
for disclosure I am from Tennessee uh
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
where this is probably the most
 
03:10:37.389 --> 03:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
pervasive um it involves a number of
 
03:10:39.269 --> 03:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
things first of all the application of
 
03:10:42.510 --> 03:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
acostic or blistering chemical and acid
 
03:10:45.790 --> 03:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
k seen diesel or mustard oil or other
 
03:10:48.429 --> 03:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
similar things and then often times and
 
03:10:50.229 --> 03:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
that will be applied to the growing band
 
03:10:52.990 --> 03:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
where the hoof grows from the leg and
 
03:10:54.389 --> 03:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
often times that will be wrapped in
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
Saran Wrap or a plastic and then a heavy
 
03:11:00.429 --> 03:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
item like a chain will be wrapped around
 
03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
that uh Tinder and uh eaten raw flesh so
 
03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
that now Tennessee walkers are
 
03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
specifically bred to have this High
 
03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
stepping action when you see a Tennessee
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
Walker walk it's pretty impressive they
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
lift their knees pretty high it's very
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
flashy that's why they're they're bred
 
03:11:19.710 --> 03:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
for that which means the higher they
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
step the more they score in competition
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not enough to just breed them to
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
step high they artificially make these
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
horses step high through pain the acid
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
goes on then it's wrapped in plastic
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
then a chain or some other heavy item is
 
03:11:36.510 --> 03:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
wrapped around it so that every time the
 
03:11:38.950 --> 03:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
horse steps down that chain impacts the
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
raw flesh causing the horse pain which
 
03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
causes the horse to lift his leg even
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
higher than he would normally in
 
03:11:47.469 --> 03:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
addition to that oftentimes they do
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
stacking that's the pictures here at the
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
bottom you can see how unnatural that
 
03:11:54.389 --> 03:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
looks in that first picture by the way
 
03:11:55.469 --> 03:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
and you can see the picture of the
 
03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
chains around the hoofs that third
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
picture shows stacking and this is where
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
they will trim the hoof to what we the
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent would be the quick the
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
growing area of the hoof and then they
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
will nail uh a large block or stacks of
 
03:12:14.349 --> 03:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
blocks um underneath the hoof to to kind
 
03:12:16.590 --> 03:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
of modify the horse's posture and make
 
03:12:18.910 --> 03:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
the horse walk in an unnatural way and
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
that is an x-ray of what stacking on a
 
03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
horse's hoof looks
 
03:12:27.630 --> 03:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
like this is called the Big Big Lick by
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the way both the um the gate that they
 
03:12:33.030 --> 03:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
have as well as the
 
03:12:35.309 --> 03:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
competitions um this also impacts some
 
03:12:37.630 --> 03:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
saddle horses as well as racking horses
 
03:12:39.229 --> 03:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
this was made ferally illegal by the
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
horse protection act in 1970 but because
 
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Agriculture
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the manpower to enforce it
 
03:12:47.550 --> 03:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
across all the different horse shows
 
03:12:50.830 --> 03:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
across the country um it has been
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
pervasive even still and there's been
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
repeated attempts um that were
 
03:12:58.110 --> 03:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly bipartisan repeatedly on the
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
Congressional level to strengthen that
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
act um including uh it's called the past
 
03:13:06.070 --> 03:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
act the uh preventing all soaring
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
techniques it's been introduced I think
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
about a dozen times by both uh both
 
03:13:12.239 --> 03:13:13.269 align:start position:0%
about a dozen times by both uh both
parties

03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
parties
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
and overwhelmingly supported but it's Al
 
03:13:17.229 --> 03:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
it's always one person of leadership of
 
03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
one body or the other but it's passed
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
the house almost unanimously it's passed
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate almost unanimously one time
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
it had 308 co-sponsors in the house the
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
Congressional house out of 435 reps
 
03:13:32.910 --> 03:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
another time it had 40 uh3 Senate
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and these include uh even
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
Republican members from North Dakota
 
03:13:39.309 --> 03:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
South Dakota Pennsylvania uh Senator
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
cppo and Idaho Kansas and
 
03:13:43.389 --> 03:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
representatives in Kansas in Florida
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
these were all prime sponsors at
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
different times the USDA did a study um
 
03:13:52.269 --> 03:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
testing horses in these Tennessee Walker
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
shows for the chemicals that are used to
 
03:13:57.790 --> 03:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
cover up the application of these acids
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
um the most recent study that I was able
 
03:14:04.349 --> 03:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
to find uh the USDA concluded 67% of the
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
hores the Tennessee Walker horses in a
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
show had the presence of chemicals that
 
03:14:10.030 --> 03:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that they had been subjected
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
to hoof soaring so that's the first
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
practice the second practice is called
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
gingering so once again some breeds are
 
03:14:21.229 --> 03:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
expected to have a high tail Carriage so
 
03:14:23.229 --> 03:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the back of the first page you'll
 
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
see a diagram of a horse and you'll see
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like a natural relaxed
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
horses um tail Carriage but some breeds
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
have a high tail Carriage naturally and
 
03:14:36.750 --> 03:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
in addition some breeds are considered
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
to be more active breeds that are
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
expected to look very Lively and so
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
there are a couple practices that are
 
03:14:46.269 --> 03:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
used to artificially engage that tail in
 
03:14:47.790 --> 03:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of more active State one of
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
them is called gingering this is where
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
um a costic item or or chemical usually
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
Ginger or historically Ginger although
 
03:14:59.710 --> 03:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
they've also used tobacco uh peppers
 
03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
onions um is inserted in the anus or in
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
Mars in the vagina of the horse in order
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
to irritate it to the point that it
 
03:15:10.870 --> 03:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
lifts its tail um naturally a horse
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
would have a relaxed tail except when
 
03:15:14.590 --> 03:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
washing it flies or if it's about to
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
defecate or urinate and where it would
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
lift its tail or if it's
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
irritated um it's also used to liven
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
sick or injured or elderly horses to
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
make them look more
 
03:15:29.189 --> 03:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
lively the again it's another all these
 
03:15:31.150 --> 03:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
practices are condemned by both the
 
03:15:32.670 --> 03:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
medical assoc the veterinary
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
associations specifically this practice
 
03:15:37.469 --> 03:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
in the 2007 Saunders comprehensive
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
veterinary dictionary um quotes that
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
gingering quote would be cons considered
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
an act of Cruelty in any civilized
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
Community um the third practice is kind
 
03:15:51.469 --> 03:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
of for a similar purpose to lift that
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
tail it's called tail nicking it affects
 
03:15:56.670 --> 03:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
the same breeds that the gingering
 
03:15:58.349 --> 03:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
affects which are usually Arabian and
 
03:16:01.870 --> 03:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
American saddle bread breeds um with
 
03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
tail nicking the tendons that attach the
 
03:16:07.469 --> 03:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
muscles of the tail are cut so that the
 
03:16:10.030 --> 03:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
muscles that lift the tail are
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
permanently in a contracted State and I
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't know about you but I can't imagine
 
03:16:15.309 --> 03:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
one of my muscles being permanently
 
03:16:19.150 --> 03:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
contracted for the rest of my life um it
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
in this state um the tail essentially
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
comes be can become permanently
 
03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
paralyzed and it leads to abnormal tail
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
Carriage the Purdue University College
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
of Veterinary Med veterinary medicine
 
03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
says that tail nicking is an unnecessary
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
and dangerous
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
procedure and just to show how kind of
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary these procedures are the last
 
03:16:45.189 --> 03:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
practice is called tail blocking the
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
last two practices were meant for breeds
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
and for disciplines that want this kind
 
03:16:53.389 --> 03:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
of lively appearance to the horse so the
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
tail was lifted and this this is for
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
Western disciplines predominantly
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
raining where they want the appearance
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
of a relaxed horse that has a completely
 
03:17:04.030 --> 03:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
opposite tail Carriage where the tail is
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
completely still and so entail blocking
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
um usually just not a veterinarian
 
03:17:12.870 --> 03:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
veterinarians usually will not do this
 
03:17:15.309 --> 03:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
but an owner or some other person will
 
03:17:18.670 --> 03:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
blindly inject inject ethanol or some
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
other nerve blocking agent um into the
 
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
nerves that affect the horse's tail at
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
the base of the tail this is extremely
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
painful ethanol Burns but um for
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
approximately four to six months it
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
impacts those nerves ability to work so
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
the horse cannot lift its tail it can't
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
switch at flies which causes flies to
 
03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
bite them and and leads to skin
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
infections it can't lift its tail when
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
it goes to defecate or urinate which
 
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
leads to infections um but also it often
 
03:17:52.950 --> 03:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
will lead to permanent nerve damage uh
 
03:17:56.189 --> 03:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
tissue damage and the as a part of the
 
03:17:58.189 --> 03:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
nerve damage the inability for the horse
 
03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
to empty its bladder or bowels it leads
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
to infections and abscesses leg
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
paralysis in some cases and in some
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
cases death uh again the Purdue
 
03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
University uh College of veterinary
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
medicine says that there is no health or
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
medical benefit to tail blocking and the
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
image here is on the front page um I
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't know how well you can see it but
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
that last image on the right hand side
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
is some of the tissue damage that can
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.550 --> 03:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
ethanol so those are the four practices
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
they're universally condemned by
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
everyone except for the individuals who
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
engage in these competitions uh to win
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
blue ribbons in the hopes that uh they
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to sell The Offspring of
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
their horses for tens if not hundreds of
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I just want to speak very briefly I
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire it's these all
 
03:19:01.309 --> 03:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
these practices are more predominant in
 
03:19:03.870 --> 03:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
the South other states have outlawed
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
many of these practices especially hoof
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
soaring um but we still have owners here
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who own these breeds
 
03:19:13.469 --> 03:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
who do engage in competition with these
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
breeds we don't have data as to how
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
often these practices are done because
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have a law or any law
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement or any other mechanism by
 
03:19:24.590 --> 03:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
which we would be tracking that
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
information um and I just want to speak
 
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
kind of personally as to how I feel
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
horses are currently seen and treated um
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
we owe so much of our human history to
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
horses I don't think we actually I think
 
03:19:42.670 --> 03:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
we kind of take for granted how much
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
horses have impacted human
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
civilization uh we don't understand in
 
03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
our modern terms but for Millennia
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
Millennia horses were if you needed to
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
go anywhere further than you could walk
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
or you need to go somewhere fast horses
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
were our cars our trains our planes
 
03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
horses in uh for constructing buildings
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
they were our construction equipment
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
they were our tractor trailers in Wars
 
03:20:10.469 --> 03:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
horses were our tanks and our fighter
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
jets wars were won or lost history was
 
03:20:16.670 --> 03:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
impacted based on whether or not an army
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
had a
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
Cavalry and yet I think horses are
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
probably the most treated like a machine
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
out of any of our domestic animals we
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
just expect pure and perfect
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
characteristics and I just want to close
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
by reading this very very short poem
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's often read at the close to the
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
British horse of the Year award um it's
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
called the Horse by ronal Ronald Duncan
 
03:20:49.189 --> 03:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
where in this wide world can man find
 
03:20:52.110 --> 03:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
nobility without Pride friendship
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
without Envy or beauty without vanity
 
03:20:59.229 --> 03:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
here where Grace is laced with muscle
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
and strength by gentleness is confined
 
03:21:05.110 --> 03:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
he serves without servility he has
 
03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
fought without inmy there is nothing so
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
powerful yet nothing less violent
 
03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
nothing so quick yet nothing more
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
patient our past has been born on his
 
03:21:20.269 --> 03:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
back all our history is his industry we
 
03:21:23.309 --> 03:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
are his heirs and he is our inheritance
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
I think that horses deserve much better
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
treatment than the practices I've laid
 
03:21:30.189 --> 03:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
out here and so I hope that you will
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
support Banning these practices I'm
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
Reed so U let me first ask um again you
 
03:21:45.309 --> 03:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
you say that um you have no data or any
 
03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
information at all as to if this
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
practice is
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
even um done in New Hampshire we have no
 
03:21:56.910 --> 03:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
data but the un uh the US Department of
 
03:21:58.990 --> 03:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture calls this pervasive in
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
these competitions and those
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
competitions do happen in this state the
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
reason we don't have data is because we
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
don't have a law against it so who would
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
track this
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
data representative
 
03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:13.189 align:start position:0%
data representative
Penza

03:22:13.189 --> 03:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
question uh when we talked offline on
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
this uh about this bill uh you had
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me uh uh some anecdotal
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
information that I would love you to
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
tell the committee if you haven't
 
03:22:28.990 --> 03:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
already about that testing that was done
 
03:22:31.469 --> 03:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
in regards could you speak to that I did
 
03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
briefly mention it um the most recent
 
03:22:36.389 --> 03:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
study that the department the US
 
03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture has done um
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
was specifically on hoof soring for uh
 
03:22:44.910 --> 03:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Walker horses and at I can I
 
03:22:47.469 --> 03:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
find the name of the actual competition
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
the show that they were at the Tennessee
 
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
Walker horse's national celebration they
 
03:22:54.030 --> 03:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
tested for the chemicals that are used
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
to cover the hoof soaring practice and
 
03:22:59.790 --> 03:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
67% of Tennessee Walker horses at that
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
show were positive for those chemicals
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
so yes it is a pervasive act even though
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
it of the four practices is the most
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
illegal representative ger thank you
 
03:23:13.389 --> 03:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative
 
03:23:16.469 --> 03:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
Reid for taking my question uh the first
 
03:23:18.990 --> 03:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
one has to do with how this would be
 
03:23:21.389 --> 03:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
enforced uh so what is the mechanism
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
here is this a matter of private
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be filing reports
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
who would be doing the the enforcement
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we hear a lot
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
about is that we are already uh
 
03:23:36.030 --> 03:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
overstretched when it comes to our
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce a lot of different uh
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
codes uh whether it's in agriculture or
 
03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty Etc so uh could you
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
explain in this bill uh how it would be
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
enforced in the state right so because
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
we are already stretched um and all all
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement of all laws or even rules
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
for that matter comes down to funding so
 
03:24:00.269 --> 03:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we uh don't have the
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
resources to enforce um the proactive
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement of these laws so sending
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
people to shows to test like the USDA
 
03:24:12.030 --> 03:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
did um or to kind of take you know
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
footage to and inspect horses then it it
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
comes down like any other crime to um
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
reports so there would be uh a number of
 
03:24:24.670 --> 03:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
organizations and activists in this
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
state that would gladly go to horse
 
03:24:27.870 --> 03:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
shows if they knew that there would be
 
03:24:30.189 --> 03:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement willing to respond
 
03:24:33.150 --> 03:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
and take video or notes or what have you
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
to um show that someone has has broken
 
03:24:39.790 --> 03:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
the law ask a followup sure follow up
 
03:24:41.070 --> 03:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that and it's
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
related to enforcement uh I was talking
 
03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
over the lunch break with a constituent
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
who is in favor of the bill generally
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
but has some concerns about generalities
 
03:24:53.110 --> 03:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
what they see as generalities in in the
 
03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill and and she was saying that with
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
with show horses right now that I guess
 
03:25:00.990 --> 03:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's the United States ecoin Federation
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
USF if you show horses that inspections
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
are done of horses uh that violators are
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
fined that there is a registry with USF
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
so and I ask this for as a genuine
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
question not knowing anything about this
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
area how effective is the kind of
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
policing that USF does because it seems
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
to me that that is the reason why they
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
are doing these horrible things to these
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
horses and if the Federation is policing
 
03:25:30.510 --> 03:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
them properly then That Should Be an
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
Effective enforcement mechanism the
 
03:25:35.309 --> 03:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
Federation is not a a governmental
 
03:25:37.870 --> 03:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
entity that is the people who conduct
 
03:25:39.790 --> 03:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
the shows and there are numerous
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
organizations that do these shows so if
 
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
you can't win your Blue Ribbon because
 
03:25:45.750 --> 03:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
you got disqualified because someone
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
finally told on you and got evidence on
 
03:25:49.630 --> 03:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
you in this particular organization you
 
03:25:51.229 --> 03:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
can move to a different organization and
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
get blue ribbons in that organization
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
and still sell your FES for tens or
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars so the
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement of law the fact that you've
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
committed a crime and could even go to
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
jail um is is effective and in fact in
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
2012 there was a woman a Tennessee
 
03:26:13.150 --> 03:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
Walker Horse breeder in Tennessee who
 
03:26:16.110 --> 03:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
after Decades of violating that horse
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
protection act on the federal level
 
03:26:19.950 --> 03:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
finally got caught in charged with about
 
03:26:22.750 --> 03:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
30 years worth of counts of violations
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
and ended up with a very Hefty uh
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
sentence so yeah it having laws against
 
03:26:30.429 --> 03:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
things that we believe are absolutely
 
03:26:34.510 --> 03:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
wrong is a good thing thank
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thanks for taking my
 
03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
question so going back to the USF and
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
pre pre-competition vet checks they
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
don't necess I guess your testimony is
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that they don't always do preet checks
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
prior to competition is that what you're
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the organization they are
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to different organizations have
 
03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
different standards however that's I
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
mean think about the
 
03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
Olympics does does the fact that you're
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
technically not supposed to juice as an
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
athlete in the Olympics stop that from
 
03:27:10.229 --> 03:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
happening no because usually there's a
 
03:27:12.269 --> 03:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
big culture around
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the athletes who stand to gain
 
03:27:17.469 --> 03:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
substantively from from doing those
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
elicit substances and the doctors who
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
then sometimes get Kickbacks or are part
 
03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
of this culture where it's accepted who
 
03:27:26.429 --> 03:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
then go along with that it is the same
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
in the horse world again we're talking
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
about one full going for hundreds of
 
03:27:34.189 --> 03:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and in that kind of
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
incentive um yeah these kind of bad
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
practices can often be overlooked either
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
as a fact of culture or
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you for your
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
testimony um I notice the bill has a
 
03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which is
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable what what did you find
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
when you went you contact these agencies
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
is there any it's just like it's going
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
to cost us something to incarcerate
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
these people so the LBA is the one that
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
contacts the agencies and Al with I
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
would say every single piece of
 
03:28:16.349 --> 03:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislation I have seen over eight years
 
03:28:18.910 --> 03:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
of being in this house that adds a
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
criminal um adds a law that criminalizes
 
03:28:25.070 --> 03:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
the behavior it's the same exact
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
indeterminate fiscal note which says we
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
understand that we will have to have
 
03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
obviously more manpower to police
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
something because you've added a law but
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
we can't tell you how much that is and
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is no different from every other
 
03:28:40.710 --> 03:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
sing every single other one that we've
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
ever had
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you followup so you don't
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate then anything in the bill
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
outside of that normal cor okay great in
 
03:28:52.750 --> 03:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
fact it can be argued depending on the
 
03:28:57.630 --> 03:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
itself representative
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:29:06.830 --> 03:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um in listening
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
to your testimony and in reading the
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill and looking at these pictures which
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
is horrible uh it sounds to me that um
 
03:29:19.830 --> 03:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
this definition of Cruelty would apply
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
to these and I'm going to read this to
 
03:29:23.229 --> 03:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
you and let me know if you think this
 
03:29:23.239 --> 03:29:25.429 align:start position:0%
you and let me know if you think this
works

03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
cruelty includes but not limited to Acts
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
or emissions injurious or detrimental to
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
the health safety or welfare of any
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
animal including the abandoning of any
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
animal without proper vision for its
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
care sustenance protection or shelter
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and based on these practices I would
 
03:29:46.830 --> 03:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
think that they would meet this
 
03:29:49.590 --> 03:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
definition I would think so too and yet
 
03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there's any instance
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
of these being policed because it's not
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
explicit follow up thank you um so we
 
03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
already have cruelty to animals and that
 
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
is the definition of Cruelty to any
 
03:30:08.590 --> 03:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
animal and I don't believe that singling
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
out these specific practices especially
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
where some of them are already illegal
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
federally why would we need to list them
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh well there are very very very many
 
03:30:21.870 --> 03:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
laws that are legal that something
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
legalize something federally that we
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
then do on the state and the question
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
then comes down and I by the way I
 
03:30:29.150 --> 03:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't actually hear a question
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
but the question then comes down to law
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement ability because is does the
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal government come into every
 
03:30:38.830 --> 03:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
single state and send federal agents
 
03:30:40.710 --> 03:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
into every single state to enforce those
 
03:30:40.720 --> 03:30:42.110 align:start position:0%
into every single state to enforce those
laws

03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
so murder is illegal federally but
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
almost always if there is a murder in a
 
03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
state it is the state that prosecutes
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
that and there are a whole bunch of laws
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
where it's the same um including in New
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it does come down to
 
03:30:56.399 --> 03:30:57.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it does come down to
law

03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:31:00.030 --> 03:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement One More followup thank you
 
03:31:03.150 --> 03:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair um also in the definition of
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals and in our animal
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
cruelty laws it says a person is guilty
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
of a class B felony who purpose ly beats
 
03:31:15.070 --> 03:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
cruy whips tortures or mutilates any
 
03:31:17.590 --> 03:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
animal so I would consider this
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
mutilation of an animal I I fully agree
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
and yet although we know uh again uh
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
presuming the question there although we
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
know that it does happen and we know on
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the federal level that it's a perv all
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
these are pervasive practices we have
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
not enforced it and I'm extremely
 
03:31:37.389 --> 03:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with that exact piece of
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
Statute because it was the second bill
 
03:31:40.710 --> 03:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
that I ever had passed and signed into
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
law law that expanded the definition of
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty to Wildlife um for the
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
entire existence of New Hampshire it was
 
03:31:52.590 --> 03:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh when once we passed our cruelty
 
03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
statute for domestic animals it's
 
03:31:57.550 --> 03:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
illegal to for example beat your dog and
 
03:31:59.550 --> 03:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
the reason it says cruy Whi by the way
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
is because our initial impet impetus for
 
03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
passing animal cruelty had a lot to do
 
03:32:07.389 --> 03:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
with the treatment of carriage horses
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it specifically says whips
 
03:32:12.269 --> 03:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
but while it was illegal to beat your
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
dog it was perfectly legal up until my
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
second term to beat a raccoon for
 
03:32:20.469 --> 03:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
example and it was um because I worked
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
so hard in that particular statute which
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
I eventually copied and moved to fishing
 
03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
game title um that that has been
 
03:32:31.229 --> 03:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
expanded to to Wildlife I am very
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:32:41.469 --> 03:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
Bixby so one of the things that I'm uh
 
03:32:43.150 --> 03:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about with this is the
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement end of things because uh
 
03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
because animal cruelty laws are
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
generally enforced by local police
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
departments and uh
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
the the the the way that that often
 
03:33:00.279 --> 03:33:01.710 align:start position:0%
the the the the way that that often
works

03:33:01.710 --> 03:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
is that uh it's done on complaint so uh
 
03:33:09.030 --> 03:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
someone calls into the police department
 
03:33:11.469 --> 03:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
and they say I think this animals being
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
mistreated and then the police
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
department goes to inspect it they may
 
03:33:17.630 --> 03:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
or not may not have anyone who has any
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
sort of expertise so how is uh how is
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
the failure of the uh of um that
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
complaint and enforcement process under
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
the existing laws which representative
 
03:33:37.950 --> 03:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
Kad just C cited going to improve if we
 
03:33:39.710 --> 03:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
have just by putting this into the
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more important so yeah
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
because I think that people are not
 
03:33:50.349 --> 03:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
aware and that there's kind of a
 
03:33:52.189 --> 03:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
presumption that it's not going to be
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
enforced because it's never been
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
enforced it's never been considered to
 
03:33:56.550 --> 03:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
be part of that and so nobody pays
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
attention to enforce it if it's explicit
 
03:34:01.389 --> 03:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
then we know it is absolutely illegal
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
the person who gets charged with it
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have I mean prosecutors have
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
leeway and if a prosecutor can look at
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
the statute and go maybe it's illegal
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not because it's not explicit
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
then maybe they don't bother with that
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
but so I don't know that there have been
 
03:34:19.070 --> 03:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
or haven't been any uh complaints along
 
03:34:20.349 --> 03:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
that line maybe there have and
 
03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutors haven't bothered to
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
prosecute but we know that if it's
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
explicit then prosecutors can say yes
 
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely this is against the law and
 
03:34:30.750 --> 03:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward thank
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
question I was curious to know because
 
03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
part of um building off of
 
03:34:40.830 --> 03:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
Representative Kat's question part of
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
the um enforcement mechanism can
 
03:34:45.630 --> 03:34:45.640 align:start position:0%
possibly include the state veterinarian
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
have you had conversations with the
 
03:34:51.550 --> 03:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian on any of those any
 
03:34:53.630 --> 03:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
investigations complaints or concerns
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
around this with regard to Soaring and
 
03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
those types of things within the state
 
03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
not the state veterinarian but
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in in specific
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarians as well as Veterinary
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
organizations I haven't met a single
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that I've talked to to any
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
actually really any horse issue about
 
03:35:12.429 --> 03:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
that would think that any of these are
 
03:35:12.439 --> 03:35:14.150 align:start position:0%
that would think that any of these are
okay

03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
practices follow up that really wasn't
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
my question it was just more about the
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism have you had any
 
03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with the state
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian regarding that portion of
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
it no and I I mean tying back to the
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
more generalized you know concerns or
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions around enforcement generally
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
um this happens every single time we add
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
anything to statute that's illegal
 
03:35:39.550 --> 03:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's a crime and I think it's
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
to decide what is the right thing and
 
03:35:44.349 --> 03:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
what is the wrong thing and make laws
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
according to that and not and if we have
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
to fund law enforcement to do that then
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
we do that because it's the right thing
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't abide by cruel and awful
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
behavior in society just because we
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
laws representative
 
03:36:08.349 --> 03:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to clarify by um
 
03:36:12.750 --> 03:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned soaring is federally
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
illegal are the other practices also
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
illegal federally not that I know of the
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
horse protection act as I understand is
 
03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
fairly broad which is why there's been
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
quite a few attempts to strengthen that
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
particular language with the past act
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
the preventing all soaring techniques
 
03:36:30.189 --> 03:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
act which goes into more detail about
 
03:36:30.199 --> 03:36:31.070 align:start position:0%
act which goes into more detail about
hoof

03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
hoof
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
soaring representative Bixby so uh there
 
03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:36.389 align:start position:0%
soaring representative Bixby so uh there
are

03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
um various animal uh rights or rights
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
and protection ction organizations that
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
make a practice of doing some level of
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
Investigation of Cruelty when they see
 
03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
it cropping up uh have you contacted any
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
of them about uh how they deal with this
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
issue both the Humane Society and Peta
 
03:37:00.990 --> 03:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
are in support of this bill um and all
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
of those organizations I'll kind of
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
speak for all of them would appreciate
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
the help of the government in stopping
 
03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
these practices to whatever extent they
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
may help out with the government doing
 
03:37:13.630 --> 03:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
you all right um any other questions for
 
03:37:17.160 --> 03:37:18.830 align:start position:0%
you all right um any other questions for
representative

03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
Reed excuse me um I do have a
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
question if I could stop coughing
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
um so tell me again why we would
 
03:37:33.399 --> 03:37:35.950 align:start position:0%
um so tell me again why we would
specifically

03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
enumerate this kind of practice when we
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
already have in statute something broad
 
03:37:44.910 --> 03:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
enough to cover all of these kinds of
 
03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
enough to cover all of these kinds of
cruel

03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
cruel
 
03:37:49.550 --> 03:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
behaviors um or procedures rather to
 
03:37:52.630 --> 03:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
these animals I mean because then aren't
 
03:37:54.670 --> 03:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
we getting ourselves into a situation
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
where we would be having to
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
enumerate a whole bunch of a whole list
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
of other things possibly not
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
capturing all of them and put ourselves
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
in a legislative bind
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
I would I would assume that we would
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
want to have uh like we have current
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
statute be a little bit more broad so
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
that it would um take into account all
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
all of these horrendous things that
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
you've outlined yeah and there's there's
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
such a thing as the balance of the
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
ambiguity of law right so we have
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
written this law very broadly I support
 
03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
the language that we currently have but
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's not being enforced in the way the
 
03:38:39.670 --> 03:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
spirit that I think it was written in
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
that broad spirit so this is why we have
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to lists and
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
these are found all throughout law
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
because we know that there are specific
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
things that we want to make sure are
 
03:38:51.990 --> 03:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
covered but that there are other things
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we want to be more broad about in
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
case we haven't thought of those things
 
03:38:58.710 --> 03:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
right so this is an example of this has
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
not been enforced it has been accepted
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
culturally the way as I said towards the
 
03:39:05.070 --> 03:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony the way we treat
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
horses is kind of in its own set um
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
because of how machine like they have
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
been throughout Society for us and how
 
03:39:14.670 --> 03:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
much we treat them like machines even
 
03:39:16.750 --> 03:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
today so because it's kind of been
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
culturally accepted it hasn't been
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
enforced even though our language is
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
Broad enough to include it and since it
 
03:39:24.670 --> 03:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enforced I'm arguing for
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
including in the including but not
 
03:39:30.830 --> 03:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
limited to list these particular acts
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.189 --> 03:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
followup we are already seeing that
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
these are not accepted uh practices by
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
the veteran Maran
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
Association by the shows themselves um
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the the eoin
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
community is already doing a pretty fair
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
job of policing themselves I mean in so
 
03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
job of policing themselves I mean in so
far

03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
as uh in so far as there you know if if
 
03:40:06.030 --> 03:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
you're found out that you're doing
 
03:40:08.189 --> 03:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
something that that you would be
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated from competition so yes the
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
veterinary Community is absolutely
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
unequivocally against all of these
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
things to say that the horse show
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
organizations are against it is kind
 
03:40:24.269 --> 03:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
of H they will say they're against it
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
they have technical rules but they don't
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily enforce it and yes I would
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
say any equestrian worth his or her salt
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
is against these but I have equestrians
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the room who will happily testify to
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that not all equestrians
 
03:40:41.550 --> 03:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
actually obey um what we would consider
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
to be ethical treatment of animals um
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact when it comes to
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
competitions it is particularly
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
egregious particularly bad because there
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
is so much money riding on these for the
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
winners and also for the organizations
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
so to say that they actually condemn is
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like they say it but then they
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
they don't really mean it a lot of
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
times okay so then I I just one more
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
followup on that
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
so if these equestrians in these shows
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
see that there is another that there is
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
an animal that is being mistreated in
 
03:41:19.439 --> 03:41:20.309 align:start position:0%
an animal that is being mistreated in
this

03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
way the way our current statute is
 
03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
written they could report them for being
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
for torturing or abusing an animal and
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
um and report them to a policeman or to
 
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
local um animal
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
officer they have that at their disposal
 
03:41:43.950 --> 03:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
to do that yes Madam chair this goes
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
back to the question I answered from
 
03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tua which is to say and
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
and just so we're aware the vast
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
majority of people who go to these shows
 
03:41:54.590 --> 03:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
are part of this culture and kind of
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
believe in these practices there can be
 
03:41:58.950 --> 03:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
activists or people who don't believe in
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
these practices and believe in the
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
ethical treatment of animals that go to
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
these shows even with the intention
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
specific intention of reporting but then
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
what happens if you don't have this
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
explicitly in law is a process cutor who
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
receives a complaint and evidence might
 
03:42:15.510 --> 03:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
then go well I don't know if I can
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
actually kind of you know prove this is
 
03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
it worth Prosecuting so making it
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
explicit helps prosecutors prosecute and
 
03:42:26.349 --> 03:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
helps those people who want to report
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
report to prosecutors okay thank you any
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee thank
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
you so much seeing none I call Kurt
 
03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
aronburg to testify and he supports the
 
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.510 --> 03:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I will be brief I'm Kurt aronberg uh
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
state director of the Humane Society of
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
the United
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
States we do support this bill and uh
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
not to get into the specifics I think
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative Reed did an excellent job
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
of explaining why this is
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
important um we believe that this is a
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
good step towards ensuring the Weare and
 
03:43:06.910 --> 03:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
dignity of horses in New Hampshire that
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
are now subjected to cruel practices for
 
03:43:12.750 --> 03:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
Cosmic IC or aesthetic reasons and to
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
win prizes in show Rings all proposed
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill share commonalities
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
as they serve no benefit to the horses
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
and are solely for
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
aesthetic Aesthetics in competition the
 
03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
only reason to do these things to horses
 
03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
which are painful cruel horses cannot
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves so we're here to
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
speak for them it hurts them it causes
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
them pain and suffering uh ethical horse
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
care and training practices can and do
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
achieve excellent results in equin
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
events and shows without resorting to
 
03:43:52.269 --> 03:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
cruel and inhumane methods so think
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
these results that these inhumane
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
methods are achieving can be achieved
 
03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
without them and the intent of this bill
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
aligns with the Humane Society's
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
commitment to animal welfare and Humane
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
treatment of horses in the echoine
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
industry that's my testimony be happy to
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you any
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:44:18.030 --> 03:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
03:44:23.229 --> 03:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
cook who has asked for five minutes and
 
03:44:30.910 --> 03:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
handout to whom should I deliver the
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and in light of
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
all of the Lively discussion that has
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
happened I probably won't need my full
 
03:44:53.149 --> 03:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
five minutes um I'm here uh in
 
03:44:56.349 --> 03:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 1182 just for
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
background uh I am a horse owner I am an
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
active equestrian competitor in the
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
fields of venting and
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
rage as a
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
result uh I am a member of both the US
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
equestrian Federation the USCF and the
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
US D Federation the US
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
DF and those are the organizations that
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
promulgate uh the rules and enforcement
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
actions as their governing bodies for
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
our US Olympic sports at that level and
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
those rules apply from the Olympic level
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
down to the level of all sanctioned
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
competition so I'm very familiar with
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
both of their rule books as well in my
 
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
opinion uh House Bill 118 to is just
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
simply unnecessary as representative Kwa
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
and others have mentioned we already
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
have a broad and extensive definition of
 
03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:49.950 align:start position:0%
have a broad and extensive definition of
animal

03:45:49.950 --> 03:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
animal
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
cruelty my and and uh that please note
 
03:45:57.870 --> 03:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
that the all of these practices if you
 
03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
go to refer to the horse protection Act
 
03:46:00.439 --> 03:46:01.550 align:start position:0%
go to refer to the horse protection Act
of

03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
1970 uh 15 USC section
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
1821 uh those practices are banned and
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
have been banned since 19
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
1970 I question the um amount of
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
prevalence of these practices uh and the
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
lack of data supporting their the
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
prevalence of
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
those the USF specifically bans in their
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
rules which is USF gr
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
838 um those all of those practices
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
offenders subject to warnings penalties
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
an elimination uh these practices as
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
noted are not performed by veterinarians
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
have been banned by the American
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
Association of ecoin practitioners uh
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
they they're for for veterinarians are
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
forbidden from practicing those and
 
03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
specifically in the case of tail
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
blocking if you do a little bit further
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
research attending show veterinarians
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
even have a tool at their disposal uh
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
electromyography and upon receipt of
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
complaint or a random test which is also
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
allowed um if failed that test will lead
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the exhibitor receiving a ban from
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
competition soaring
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
again is recognized as a practice
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
especially in the show ring exhibition
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
of Tennessee walking horses and in fact
 
03:47:30.189 --> 03:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
when you go to the general generalized
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
definitions of soaring it they will
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
always refer to the fact that soaring as
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
performed in Tennessee walking
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
horses I checked the official calendar
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
of the Tennessee Walking Horse

03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
Dixon
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
line I don't believe it serves to
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
clutter the animal cruelty statutes with
 
03:47:59.710 --> 03:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
a specific ban for practice that's
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
universally banned and previously
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
performed on horses that are virtually
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
absent from the New Hampshire population
 
03:48:08.550 --> 03:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
and for which there are no competitions
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
we get into the debate which has already
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
surfaced in the committee that the more
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
the larger the number of specific
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
practices that you outlaw in statute the
 
03:48:24.429 --> 03:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
less difficult it is to enforce the
 
03:48:27.389 --> 03:48:27.399 align:start position:0%
broader cruelty statutes as they already
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
exist for if a prosecutor were to say
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
this is listed and I'm not sure about
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
the others why aren't they all listed
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're you you will be creating a box
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
that will be very very difficult for
 
03:48:42.670 --> 03:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
yourself to get out of to enforce the
 
03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
existing cruelty statutes my suspicion
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
is that house bill 1182 it's just an
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
attempt to create a precedent for the
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
ban of a laundry list of individual
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
items which don't have any place in
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
statute that is what your rules are for
 
03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:01.429 align:start position:0%
statute that is what your rules are for
and

03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
I respectfully expect that the committee
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
will rule uh 1182 is inexpedient to
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislate for all of those above reasons
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
please also remember that any animal
 
03:49:16.030 --> 03:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigation for the equin
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire requires the
 
03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
presence of the state veterinarian and
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
so that is another resource that I would
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that you you check into as to
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh this addition to the
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
statutes will be of any benefit to New
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony any
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr cook see being none I
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for thank you
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon I
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
call sorry can't read the first name but
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
Rosenfield Avis I'm sorry I couldn't
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
read your handwriting that's quite all
 
03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
right Avis Rosenfield correct
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair and
 
03:50:11.710 --> 03:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh my background I have been with horses
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
my entire life and I won't give you my
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
age to give you my entire life but grew
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
up on horses and was part of the 1960
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
action which Mr cook made reference to
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
that was enacted in 1970 that made this
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
cruelty um to any horse and it made it
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
now in 10 states in the United States
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
that it is illegal to do this it also
 
03:50:38.590 --> 03:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
made it so that you cannot sell a horse
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
you cannot bring it to auction you
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
cannot bring it to some shows however
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement I've heard that asked many
 
03:50:48.510 --> 03:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
times here that is a question and I
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
support this bill because it's more
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
specific than the animal cruelty Bill we
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
need to have specifics in detail because
 
03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
people it's the kiss method keep it
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
simple stupid well people will also keep
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
a blind eye when they are at shows
 
03:51:06.750 --> 03:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
because as representative Reed said it's
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
a cultural thing and that subculture
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
Cuts very deep and if you want to sell
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
your horses in the future they will
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
blackball you if you have gone and
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
reported them so you don't want to break
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
that culture bubble that's a problem I
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
have seen it in my aqaa I have seen it
 
03:51:26.070 --> 03:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
in my Thor breads I've seen it in the
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
warm Bloods we had to break the culture
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the AQA and we had to ban some of the
 
03:51:35.349 --> 03:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
trainers for abusive treatment to horses
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
it was not in an animal cruelty Bill and
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
it did happen here in New Hampshire and
 
03:51:39.359 --> 03:51:40.269 align:start position:0%
it did happen here in New Hampshire and
in

03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
Maine and in nowhere in that bill would
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
it have been enforcable because of the
 
03:51:49.630 --> 03:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
way the bill was written it is a
 
03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
question in everyone's mind is that or
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it cruelty or is that just
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
reprimanding the child well the child is
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
1,200 lb or 1300 lb so people say well
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of big should I reprimand it
 
03:52:06.670 --> 03:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
that way or another way publicly or
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
non-publicly so again when you're at a
 
03:52:12.790 --> 03:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
show and people are looking at another
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
horse that is being shown they don't
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
know if the horse has been treated
 
03:52:19.710 --> 03:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
cruelty or not they have no
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
idea if they get into conversations
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pass that
 
03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
conversation on and who there is going
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
to enforce it because judges want their
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
jobs they get paid to be
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
there who's going to call the
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that day it's a Saturday or
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
Sunday is he going to come out probably
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
not so you need to be specific
 
03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
and you need to have this known to
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
everyone who is operating any kind of
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
horse show or event in the state of New
 
03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a federal law we now need
 
03:52:54.750 --> 03:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
to make it a state law like the other 10
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
states have and there are 10 countries
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
that have as well we need to enforce
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
this yes the culture needs to change yes
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to enforce it
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
but we need to make a best effort to do
 
03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
so and I totally support this bill
 
03:53:15.550 --> 03:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
because as a horse owner we need to
 
03:53:18.030 --> 03:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
protect our
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
animals representative
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um in
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
speaking about the bands um are you
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
aware that there are different levels of
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
banning as well right um lifetime banss
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
um and partial bands
 
03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:36.229 align:start position:0%
um and partial bands
correct

03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
okay represent viby
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so um is there any uh information
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
or data showing that the 10 states that
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
have uh this in their state law uh have
 
03:53:54.349 --> 03:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
a lower incidence of this Behavior than
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
the ones that are just being um Guided
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
by federal law it's an excellent
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
question I don't have data with me today
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
but if you would like it I would
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
certainly do the research and present it
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ger thank you
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
question uh when I was speaking over the
 
03:54:13.950 --> 03:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
lunch break with a faer who had
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
contacted me supportive of Bill
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
generally but had some concerns in
 
03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
particular she was talking about various
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
ways in which a faer might work with a
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
client and a horse to correct an issue
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
with a horse for example a horse being
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
lame or have something some other issue
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
and her concern was that uh the
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
treatment which will vary depending upon
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
the horse depending upon the specific
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
condition might
 
03:54:44.510 --> 03:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
um leave that faer open to accusations
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
of of Cruelty um obviously it's not the
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
same as aesthetic reasons for for shows
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
but do you see any any concern with that
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about horses that are
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
being corrected because of ailments that
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
they may have there are different kinds
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
of treatments uh with with the Hooves as
 
03:55:05.229 --> 03:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
I understand it that one might employ
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that this could potentially open
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
faers who were not engaged in what we
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
would consider cruelty but might open
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
them up to
 
03:55:17.070 --> 03:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
accusations no I do not and the reason I
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
do not is because I myself have had
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
horses that have had all kinds of hoof
 
03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
issues it's nature of the Beast yes
 
03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
there are different ways to treat that
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
they can open up the blister they can
 
03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
cut it Let it bleed out um they might
 
03:55:33.229 --> 03:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
use a treatment that is recommended by a
 
03:55:36.429 --> 03:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or they might use and and I
 
03:55:38.229 --> 03:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
wish he were still alive to speak today
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
Dr Beckman was one of the best
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in our state at the
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
racetracks he had some of the best
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
methods known and he would bring on
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
unsound horse sound in record-breaking
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
time now did he do it unethically I
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't believe so I've watched many of
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
his methods with my horses and it was
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate included soaking the horse
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
and epson salt it included various
 
03:56:06.149 --> 03:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
different methods kind methods uh
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
long-term methods to treat the horse
 
03:56:10.750 --> 03:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's no different than you stepping on a
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
nail and what do you do to treat that
 
03:56:16.149 --> 03:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
infection medications oral or
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
medications that you use that are
 
03:56:21.870 --> 03:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
topical some even have to be injected so
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
no I don't see a faer being at risk
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
unless of course you do find a Faria who
 
03:56:30.429 --> 03:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
is cruly truly cruy treating the horse
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
with a chemical burn just to get an
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
action out of the horse that will show a
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
different sign on the horse's
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
foot thank you very much
 
03:56:39.239 --> 03:56:40.870 align:start position:0%
foot thank you very much
representative

03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
Duty uh thank you so if I'm hearing you
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that even if
 
03:56:50.790 --> 03:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh is limited the advantage
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill and uh um you know spelling
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
out all of these different treatments
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
could be educational especially in uh
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
rural law enforcement where they're more
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
likely to um come across issues than
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
let's say in my city of Nashville where
 
03:57:14.110 --> 03:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a horse in the
 
03:57:16.269 --> 03:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
entire city is that what you're
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
basically saying rural law enforcement
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
is going to have a very difficult time
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
Discerning the difference between Humane
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
and inhumane treatment to many animals
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
not just horses um you have to be there
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment uh you have to be familiar
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the appearance of what the foot
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
would look like it's no different than
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
you being a specialist in the medical
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
field to some extent because you won't
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
know the difference between my horse
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
having had um a foot saw that blew out
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
an abcess versus did I do something to
 
03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that horse you just won't know because
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
you don't know the animals history you
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been there walking that path
 
03:58:01.830 --> 03:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the animal so again
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
I I do think enforcement from law
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement is going to be difficult I
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
think enforcement is going to have to be
 
03:58:10.990 --> 03:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
a cultural change I have seen the
 
03:58:13.469 --> 03:58:13.479 align:start position:0%
cultural changes in many states and in
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
auctions and in other places I've been
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I've been in the horse industry my
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
entire life my family was in the horse
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
industry race horses we had saddle
 
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
breads as well so I've seen what has
 
03:58:28.469 --> 03:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
occurred Through The Years what was
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
Humane and inhumane and as a child
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
started arguing it so that's why I'm
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
here today I'm still arguing this same
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
thing the same as I did with the Jockey
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
Club it's in Humane to do some of the
 
03:58:43.149 --> 03:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
things we have done to the horses and I
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe we need to be specific we can't
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
be generic like the current cruelty bill
 
03:58:51.870 --> 03:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
is it's too generic you need to be
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
specific what is the root cause of this
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
this afternoon thank you call Jennifer
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:09.349 align:start position:0%
this afternoon thank you call Jennifer
Parker

03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
Parker
 
03:59:17.070 --> 03:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
minutes hello I just have a couple notes
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
from sparked by previous testimonies
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
before launching into my own um I
 
03:59:28.469 --> 03:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
competed extensively for 10 years in
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
Eventing and I was chosen for random
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
drug testing one time at one sanction
 
03:59:35.070 --> 03:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
show and there are also many
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
competitions that are not sanctioned and
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
therefore not governed by the USC
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
F uh my name is Jennifer Parker I am
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
owner and operator of mrey equin I'm a
 
03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
professional horse trainer writing
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
instructor ecoin massage therapist and
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
Riki Master with 20 years of exposure to
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
the ecoin industry and a Bachelor of
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
Science and equin studies I have never
 
03:59:59.309 --> 03:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
seen the practices of hoof soring
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
gingering tail blocking or tail nicking
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
in action but I was taught universally
 
04:00:06.910 --> 04:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
through my education at two separate
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
colleges that these practices were
 
04:00:10.990 --> 04:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
painful and unnecessary methods that
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
should not be used these methods are
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes used in styles of writing that
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
I do not participate in saddle seat and
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
park style riding whose Origins lie in
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
the 17 and 1800s tradition of showing
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
off your fancy High stepping horse
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
during Sunday rides in the park in this
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
realm status came from having a flashy
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
and spirited Mount and to this day the
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
disciplines these certain disciplines of
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
writing aim for a certain level of anx
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
excitement and anxiety in their show
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
horses this is where gingering hoof
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
saring and tail nicking come into play
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
to elicit these symtoms of a spirited
 
04:00:50.830 --> 04:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
Mount High stepping with a lifted tail
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
that such judges are looking for in the
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
case of tail blocking the horse's
 
04:00:58.590 --> 04:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
ability to visibly react to the rider's
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
AIDS as well as Swit their tail at
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
irritating flies in the pasture is taken
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
away these practices are used to project
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
a certain image in the show ring an
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
image not based on correct biomechanics
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the horse but instead based on
 
04:01:15.870 --> 04:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
preferences fads and
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
styles employing any of these practices
 
04:01:20.429 --> 04:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
clearly comes at the expense of the
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
horse's comfort and well-being I cannot
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
speak with firsthand knowledge of these
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
practices via site or action and I hope
 
04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
I am never able to do so but I can speak
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
for the horses because I've dedicated my
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
life to being their voice to bring the
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
bridge between our two species
 
04:01:41.309 --> 04:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
I can speak for the horses who
 
04:01:43.630 --> 04:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
continually teach me gentler and more
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
harmonious ways to ride and train the
 
04:01:48.990 --> 04:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
horses who have come into my care harmed
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
by humans to whom I promise never
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
again they don't want these practices to
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
happen to them and neither should you
 
04:01:58.359 --> 04:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
happen to them and neither should you
thank

04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I want to thank
 
04:02:10.349 --> 04:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
you for testifying this afternoon thank
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
you um out of pink cards and I would
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
like to have the blue sheet if we are
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
because so I was wondering if the
 
04:02:32.229 --> 04:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner might be able to answer a
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:45.149 align:start position:0%

04:02:45.149 --> 04:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if you've read the
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh I don't know if uh Dr
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
Crawford has mentioned this bill at all
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
to you but my my question is basically
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with cruelty to horses
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
is this something because horses are
 
04:03:05.950 --> 04:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
considered livestock that the that the
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
he would need the the state vet or his
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
assistant would need to be called in uh
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
in order to adjudicate or to to
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
investigate representative BP that's a
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
that's a good question but I believe
 
04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
that any veterinarian could be called in
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know in these animal cruelty cases
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
we only serve in a advisory capacity we
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
did not take a position on this bill
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
although we were well aware of it
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
because it is totally out of our
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction okay so any veterinarian
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
would be but but you need to have a
 
04:03:39.229 --> 04:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarian called in
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
I I believe so but I can't speak with
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
great Authority because it was a while
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
ago that the bill cross my desk and I
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
looked at it and we talked and said okay
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
this this really is nothing we need to
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
weigh in on and moved on to the ones
 
04:03:55.710 --> 04:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
that do concern us okay thank you all
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for indulging us
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%

04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:10.349 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
pressure

04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay so on our blue sheet for HB 1182 we
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
have two people in favor of the bill and
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
two people uh opposed to the bill and in
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%

afternoon
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
snowy days make me feel like it's
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
morning all day I need a pink card from

04:05:15.120 --> 04:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
you so when you get a
moment

04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay just for 1680 or 1182 I was going
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
to speak on the previous one but
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
you go ahead okay I am represent
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
presented Diane Kelly representing
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 32 which is Temple Wilton and
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
newp switch um and I am introducing this
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill 1680 in the hopes of helping to
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate puppy mills um having been an
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
animal lover my whole life I am aware of
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
the problem of puppy mills um
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing dogs in terribly inhumane
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
horrible ways um and selling them to
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting families um in retail
 
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
outlets and I'm hoping that New
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do our part to end that by
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
um passing this measure um several of
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states are passing these
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
laws either have or are working on them
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
um and it concerns me that if we do not
 
04:06:29.710 --> 04:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
um we will end up being the puppy sales
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
Mecca of the area which we do not want
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I realize that there are breeders
 
04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns about this but um
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying statute for 37 col 7
 
04:06:46.710 --> 04:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
already excludes breeders but um I am
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
open to further refining the definition
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
of retail to um clarify that we do not
 
04:06:52.680 --> 04:06:53.950 align:start position:0%
of retail to um clarify that we do not
mean

04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
animals um from breeders rather just
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
animals um you know animals not breed on
 
04:06:59.600 --> 04:07:00.309 align:start position:0%
animals um you know animals not breed on
the

04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:00.319 --> 04:07:01.910 align:start position:0%
the
premises

04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
premises
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
um so um it seems to me that there are
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
more than enough rescue animals to meet
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
animal loving families needs and also
 
04:07:14.910 --> 04:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
responsible breeders
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
um and um I just feel that this is a
 
04:07:20.309 --> 04:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
common sense Humane bill that helps to
 
04:07:23.229 --> 04:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
end the cruel and unnecessary industry
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
industry of puppy mills and encouraging
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
responsible breeding practices and
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
commerce and
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
um providing more opportunities for
 
04:07:35.469 --> 04:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
rescues rescue animals to find loving
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
homes um I feel at this point that
 
04:07:40.990 --> 04:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
nobody needs a pet store a retail outlet
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
to find puppies and um other pets we
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
have many puppies available directly
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
from responsible breeders and a large
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
network of um shelters and
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
rescues and um basically I just wanted
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill and then there
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
are a several people behind me who can
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions and speak further to
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
it any questions from the committee
 
04:08:10.349 --> 04:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
question um you said that you weren't uh
 
04:08:18.189 --> 04:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
this was not intended for
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
breeders however it states that a pet
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
vent means a pet vendor so anyone who
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
basically breeds dogs or cats or ferrets
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh is a pet vendor and um it says a pet
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
vendor that transfers
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
animals at retail to the public from a
 
04:08:38.439 --> 04:08:39.870 align:start position:0%
animals at retail to the public from a
physical

04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
physical
 
04:08:43.389 --> 04:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
facility now if a breeder is
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
breeding and they have a farm or they
 
04:08:48.309 --> 04:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
have their home that is a physical
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
facility right so it needs to be
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
clarified and I'm open to an amendment
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify that
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%

04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%

don't understand this out of state
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
Brokers with no physical facility in New
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will remain a viable business
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
option I'm Happ
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
do we understand what that means to be
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%

trouble hearing you I have even with
 
04:10:15.109 --> 04:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
hearing aids I have trouble hearing and
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
The Mask makes it where I can't read
 
04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
lips oh okay okay is that better a
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
little bit Yeah okay great so under the
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh the third from the
 
04:10:27.070 --> 04:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
bottom it says outof State Brokers with
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
no physical facility in New Hampshire
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
will remain a viable business option do
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know what that addresses or what
 
04:10:39.070 --> 04:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
that means I would imagine that in
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressing this it means people um um
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
puppy mill type breeders from out of
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
state will still be able to bring
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
puppies into retail establishments but
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure okay okay thank you so I
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't need a pain card because you
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
okay next person I'd like to call up is
 
04:11:06.389 --> 04:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
um Kurt aronberg from the Humane Society
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Kurt aronberg I'm the
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
state director of the Humane Society of
 
04:11:20.910 --> 04:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
the United States here in support of
 
04:11:20.920 --> 04:11:21.870 align:start position:0%
the United States here in support of
this

04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill and uh you know we've already heard
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversation about this bill um
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
in both bodies and what we have learned
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
so far in the robust discussion is that
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh we probably should think about
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
refining the definition of
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
retail we would recommend that it would
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
read retail pet store means a pet vendor
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
that transfers dogs or cats not breed on
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the premises at retail to the public
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
from a physical
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
facility retail pet store does not
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
include an animal shelter facility or a
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
pet vendor that sells only such animals
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
that he has produced and raised so we
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
believe that that would
 
04:12:16.000 --> 04:12:17.830 align:start position:0%
believe that that would
effectively

04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
cover um responsible breeders in the
 
04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:25.950 align:start position:0%
cover um responsible breeders in the
state

04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
um now there was also concern raised
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
about shelters that buy dogs from puppy
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
mills most shelters in New Hampshire
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
operate responsibly while doing the
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
life-saving and often thankless work of
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
caring for and rehoming animals puppy
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
selling pet stores on the other hand buy
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
puppies from puppy mills that churn out
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
as many puppies as possible with no
 
04:12:53.309 --> 04:12:53.319 align:start position:0%
regard for the health and well-being of
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
their breeding dogs or their offspring
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
nor for the public who will end up with
 
04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
unhealthy pets if there are shelters in
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are buying dogs from
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
puppy mills the general court might
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
consider legislation that prohibits this
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
practice as no shelter should be putting
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
money into the cruel puppy mill pipeline
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
but this bill is not about
 
04:13:20.429 --> 04:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
that curiously the opposition to the
 
04:13:23.070 --> 04:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
bill presented doomsday scenarios about
 
04:13:25.950 --> 04:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
pet acquisition even though this bill
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
allows existing pet stores to keep
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
selling puppies as such the bill
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
preserves pet stores as an option for
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
buying a dog or cat in the five
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
communities that currently have such
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
stores it is notable however that even
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
in states where dozens of stores were
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
required to stop selling puppies there
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
is no evidence of increased online sales
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
plus since 2013 the United States
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture has regulated
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
those selling puppies
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
online just as it regulates those who
 
04:14:03.309 --> 04:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
sell puppies to pet
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
stores data shows that USDA licensed
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
commercial breeders who sell puppies
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
through pet stores and online are
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
currently breeding 30,000 plus fewer
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
dogs than they were 10 years ago if pet
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
store laws that have been enacted during
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
this time simply shifted the market from
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
pet stores to online USDA license
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
facilities wouldn't have significantly
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
shrunk these laws are effective in
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
stopping the cruel practices of puppy
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
mills that pervade this industry
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire is home to a wide
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
range of responsible breeders I think
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from some of them today if
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
you ask them questions you'll find out
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
how responsible they are who sell
 
04:14:52.189 --> 04:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
directly to interested buyers that
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
aren't afraid to show them how their
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
dogs are raised unlike these pet
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
stores seeking out local breeders has
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
always been the way many New Hampshire
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
residents find the puppy of their choice
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
their hunting dogs Etc
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
and this is certainly true for show dogs
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs as I said and service
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
animals plus there is a growing movement
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
to increase and support small scale
 
04:15:21.790 --> 04:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
responsible responsible breeding the
 
04:15:23.950 --> 04:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
functional dog collaborative based here
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a new group that
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
does just
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
that I'll try to be brief I'm going to
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
finish soon another Topic at the hearing
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
was merely regulating the sale of
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
puppies and pet stores if the committee
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
would like to place regulations on
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
existing pup p puppy selling stores it
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
is crucial these regulations are not
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
viewed as negating the need to stop
 
04:15:52.750 --> 04:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
additional pet stores from selling
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
puppies if additional puppy stores are
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to open in New Hampshire they
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
will bring with them many animal welfare
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
and consumer protection
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
problems even if it was possible to
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
ensure puppies came from Humane
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
breeders through regulations which have
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
notably been proven ineffective in other
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
states there would still be long
 
04:16:18.750 --> 04:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
stressful transports of dogs
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
questionable inore treatment which we'll
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
hear about sick puppy sales which we'll
 
04:16:27.309 --> 04:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
hear about misleading sale tactics and
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
predatory lending selling puppies and
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
pet stores is too complicated and broken
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
of a model to merely regulate lastly the
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
hsus supports laws that prohibit the
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
sale of dogs and cats in outdoor venues
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
like flea markets and parking lots
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
roadside Etc because outdoor sales
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislation should apply to all persons
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
not just pet vendors this is likely best
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
handled as a separate bill from this pet
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
store pet vendor bill for your reference

exemptions and we suggest that New
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consider legislation similar
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
Maryland's law if you're concerned about
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
sales that's my testimony today
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
thanks representative H Haskins thank
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you Mr arenburg
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today I missed the
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
all important phrase that you thought
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be amended that began with
 
04:17:47.710 --> 04:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
pet vendor
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
transfers something about pets that had
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
not been raised by
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
them so the the definition of retail pet
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
store would be such
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
this ret retail pet store means a pet
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
vendor that transfer dogs or cats
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
not bred on the
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
premises at retail to the public from a
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
physical facility so retail pet store
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
does not include an animal shelter
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
facility or a pet vendor that sells only
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
such animals that he or she has produced
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
and raised thank you very much
 
04:18:29.950 --> 04:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative nap thank you madam chair
 
04:18:31.109 --> 04:18:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
wonder if you know anything about the
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
trends in pet stores in the state I mean
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
the one that was in Portsmouth when I
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
moved here as closed you mentioned there
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
was only pet stores in five communities
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
well are are you know there are only
 
04:18:44.189 --> 04:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
five right now and they're Mo mostly
 
04:18:46.109 --> 04:18:46.119 align:start position:0%
small scale there is one in Manchester
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
that opened up in the spring called The
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
Puppy Palace which is pretty scary to me
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
um they display their dogs in plexy
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
glass cages you can't touch them until
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
they come out and what they do is they
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
create an emotional bond with the child
 
04:19:03.630 --> 04:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
mostly um and then the parent is at a
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
loss it's really it's really uh hard
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
deceptive kind of practice like a car
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
dealership but for kids so uh you know
 
04:19:15.550 --> 04:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
they have all the same kind of things go
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
to the finance person oh you don't have
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
to have the money today we'll be happy
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
well what happens is you get a sick dog
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
that dies on you and you have to pay for
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
it for the rest of that term of five six
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
10 years whatever they uh Finance the
 
04:19:28.479 --> 04:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
10 years whatever they uh Finance the
dog

04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
dog
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
at followup yet um you didn't exactly
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
answer my question do you know anything
 
04:19:36.429 --> 04:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
about the trends in the state I mean has
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
it been well what we're concerned about
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire as has been
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned will become the place to come
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
and buy a puppy store dog and my
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
organization believes firmly and has
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
data to back it up that dogs sold in pet
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
stores are primarily dogs from inhumane
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
puppy mill operations from far
 
04:20:00.189 --> 04:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
away representative Murray and then I'll
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
get to you thank you madam chair um
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I just
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear given um your earlier
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
testimony was that that language change
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
that's based on information coming from
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the other body well we no it's based on
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
or where on objections from the the uh
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
breeders that we we have heard that they
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
are concerned that they'll be caught up
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
as as retailers that is not the intent
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill so we want to make sure
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
that those objections are taken
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
seriously and dealt with because it's a
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
really good bill for animals and we we
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose that if you care
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
about dogs if you've ever loved a dog or
 
04:20:43.239 --> 04:20:44.429 align:start position:0%
about dogs if you've ever loved a dog or
a

uh puppies and kittens do you know
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
anything about that that's already in

existence well the I leave the
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%

already in exist I do but that's not
 
04:21:23.149 --> 04:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
what I'm here to testify on so I'm
 
04:21:24.670 --> 04:21:24.680 align:start position:0%

who have come to testify so um I ask you
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
to refrain all right I'll tell the
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%

04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
the retail pet stores sell dogs not
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%

04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
is I don't know
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question Mr
 
04:22:16.349 --> 04:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
arberg uh do you know is there any data
 
04:22:17.950 --> 04:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
probably not specific to New Hampshire
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
but even nationally
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh dogs that are abandoned
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
right and the the it seems to me but I
 
04:22:29.550 --> 04:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if data supports this that
 
04:22:31.870 --> 04:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
dogs who are abandoned by owners are
 
04:22:33.870 --> 04:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
much more likely to have been adopted
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
through puppy mills and through pet
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
stores uh than dogs that are acquired or
 
04:22:42.550 --> 04:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
adopted rather through licensed uh
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
breeders but is there uh any data at all
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
regarding How likely a dog that is sold
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
to a family who for a wide variety of
 
04:22:53.710 --> 04:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
reasons whether it has to do with the
 
04:22:56.429 --> 04:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
family or it has to do with the dog that
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
the retailers don't know anything about
 
04:23:01.630 --> 04:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
not matching families or dogs Etc it it
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me that there are reasons why
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
be much higher rate of Abandonment of
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
dogs per purchased this way as opposed
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
to from responsible breeders is there
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
any data on that not that I have or am
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
aware of but I can look into that for
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
you and I will and get back to you happy
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
to do that that would be very helpful if
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
you could do that thank you and I'd be
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
happy to get back to anyone with any
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
questions or quizzes for
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
me any other questions from Sternberg
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I'm sorry representative
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
Bixby so uh you mentioned so you you
 
04:23:39.550 --> 04:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
presented a possible Amendment to the
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
definition of a retail pet store and uh
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
one of the issue I noticed a couple of
 
04:23:50.349 --> 04:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
things with it one is that
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
um it might not take into account uh the
 
04:24:00.030 --> 04:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
those people who uh breed uh breed dogs
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
or or cats and do not reach the
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
threshold of 30 animals uh and that they
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
might actually end up being
 
04:24:12.750 --> 04:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
considered uh retail stores under this
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
under that revised definition because
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're not pet vendors under state law
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh because they don't reach that
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
threshold so that's something that that
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken care of be care is
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
that something that you'd be willing to
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
work on certainly I I mean this this is
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
a suggestion um I I thought it would be
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
a good idea to address the issue in some
 
04:24:36.109 --> 04:24:36.119 align:start position:0%
way today because it's I believe it's
 
04:24:38.830 --> 04:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to come up and uh I think
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's important that the Breeders respon
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about responsible breeders
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
and we assume that all of the Breeders
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
we hear from will be our
 
04:24:50.590 --> 04:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
responsible um
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
and we want them to be covered and and
 
04:24:56.910 --> 04:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
not be affected by this bill when they
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be thank
 
04:25:03.149 --> 04:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Howard thank you
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I'm not sure I guess I
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't know why somebody would buy a
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
puppy from a pet store rather than a
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
breeder in the first place are they
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
substantially cheaper or so I can just
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
give you an
 
04:25:15.359 --> 04:25:18.389 align:start position:0%
give you an
anecdotal

04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um in my family uh
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
six-year-old girl who's now 29 went into
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
the mall with her mother and went into
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
the pet store to look at the dogs and
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
came home with a dog named
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
Wall-E and and I didn't know until we
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
they got home and
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh we love that dog but that dog was
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
very sick for a long time had all kinds
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
of behavioral
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
problems um it was a Puggle I don't know
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
if you know what that is part Beagle
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
part POG was the best looking dog I ever
 
04:25:55.000 --> 04:25:56.910 align:start position:0%
part POG was the best looking dog I ever
saw

04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
saw
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
um but these dogs are bred only to be
 
04:26:04.269 --> 04:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
sold in these stores in an
 
04:26:08.349 --> 04:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
emotional tight mostly to a child that
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
then is there's nothing what is that
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
parent to do and most people do want to
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
meet the dog have a relationship with
 
04:26:21.269 --> 04:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
the dog before they bring the dog home
 
04:26:24.269 --> 04:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
so these online things do not meet meet
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
fit that and what the perfect situation
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
is the rescue situation where you meet
 
04:26:34.349 --> 04:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
the dog you fall in love with the dog
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
the dog needs a home the dog gets a home
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost thousands and thousands
 
04:26:39.199 --> 04:26:40.030 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost thousands and thousands
of

04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
dollars and you know that's the
 
04:26:44.189 --> 04:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
situation we're trying to Foster and in
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
this bill it does
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
encourage that in pet stores you could
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
have these nonprofit legitimate rescue
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
home any other questions from the
 
04:27:03.149 --> 04:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Mr
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
aronberg I'd like to call um uh
 
04:27:05.640 --> 04:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
aronberg I'd like to call um uh
Commission

04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
Jasper to come and speak on this bill he
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chairman members of
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
the committee I am still Shan Jasper
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
food I am in opposition to to this bill
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons I'll start off
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
with so you understand the
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
only difference between a shelter rescue
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
and a pet store in law is that a uh
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
shelter does not have to provide a
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
um certificate for transfer from a New
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a dog that is born in New
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but what I can tell you is
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill that really tugs at
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's hearts
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
strings but there's no evidence before
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
you that there's any difference in where
 
04:28:14.109 --> 04:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
the animals come
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
from the fact of the matter is that more
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
animals are imported into the state of
 
04:28:21.680 --> 04:28:22.750 align:start position:0%
animals are imported into the state of
New

04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by shelters and rescues than
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
by pet
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
stores I can also tell you that as
 
04:28:32.159 --> 04:28:33.870 align:start position:0%
stores I can also tell you that as
commissioner

04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
disproportional amount of the fines that
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
we Levy against pet stores or shelters
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
04:28:45.319 --> 04:28:47.149 align:start position:0%
goes to
shelters

04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
sadly last
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
week or actually it was two Fridays ago
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
now we issued the largest fine that we
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
ever have to anybody dealing with
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
pets and we'll probably we'll go to a
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and there will probably be some
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
things going but because this has been
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
an ongoing problem this was an
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
unlicensed facility which couldn't get
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
licensed because of the conditions I
 
04:29:21.980 --> 04:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
issued a fine of $
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
issued a fine of $
[Music]

04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
34,400 by far the largest
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
fine that was after repeated inspections
 
04:29:31.159 --> 04:29:32.670 align:start position:0%
fine that was after repeated inspections
and

04:29:32.670 --> 04:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
warnings and they just
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
continued to do exactly what they were
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
doing they
 
04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
transferred you know more than twice the
 
04:29:46.030 --> 04:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
limit without a license and of all the
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
dogs they transferred I believe it was
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
two actually were New Hampshire
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
dogs so when people tell you you know
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
well we don't want animals coming from
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
puppy mills find me something in this
 
04:30:03.790 --> 04:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
bill that actually prevents that from
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
happening there's nothing in the bill
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
that does
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
that whether it be pet
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
stores or
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
shelters the animals are coming into
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
this state from Texas Florida Kentucky
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
and other Southern States these are not
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
animals that are being rescued in New
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't actually know nobody
 
04:30:29.349 --> 04:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
knows within the department what the
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
conditions are that these animals are
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
being um raised in can also tell you
 
04:30:41.790 --> 04:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
that the only people importing cats are
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
the rescues and they're all again from
 
04:30:48.510 --> 04:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
out of state so if the goal is to
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate puppy mills this bill does
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to do that what it does is
 
04:30:55.279 --> 04:30:56.910 align:start position:0%
nothing to do that what it does is
eliminate

04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
competition one of the shelters recently
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
opened a retail store in the Mall of New
 
04:31:05.000 --> 04:31:06.790 align:start position:0%
opened a retail store in the Mall of New
Hampshire

04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
how's that any different than a pet
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
store what this bill also does is
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately take
 
04:31:17.229 --> 04:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
away a business from people yes you can
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
transfer it to your son or your daughter
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
you can keep it as long as you can but
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
what you may have worked your whole life
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
for when you cannot no longer if you
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a family member it's done
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't the way we normally do things
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that may be more my
 
04:31:37.469 --> 04:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
my personal view than something I should
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
be saying as a um as a commissioner
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
however that is something I think that
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken into
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
consideration so as you may know this is
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
the word forw word identical Bill to
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
what was heard in the senate about two
 
04:31:54.080 --> 04:31:55.429 align:start position:0%
what was heard in the senate about two
weeks

04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
ago and I think this the Senate while I
 
04:32:00.109 --> 04:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't know the final disposition if
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
there has been one they're looking at
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
other options and what I would suggest
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
is that if you're going to do something
 
04:32:07.870 --> 04:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill we ought to be getting at
 
04:32:10.030 --> 04:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
the heart of the problem and looking at
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
where these animals are are coming from
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
how they're how they're raised I mean if
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with what's going on in
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
California with uh Hogs and chickens the
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says you can regulate the
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
conditions in which the animals are
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually raised coming into California
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
so we could do the same thing I'm
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
suggested we have become The Dumping
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
Ground for thousands of animals which
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
because you look at the addresses you go
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
could they really be rescuing that many
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
animals off the streets in these
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
particular areas I doubt it I don't know
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
but you receive no evidence to say
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything to the contrary can also tell
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
you since the hearing was you know in
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate was a couple weeks ago
 
04:32:58.590 --> 04:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
nobody's come forward with any in
 
04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
information to tell me that I was wrong
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
about what I've been saying which I was
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
expecting I would hear something
 
04:33:07.709 --> 04:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
uh relative to
 
04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
regardless if you want to
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
protect animals then you need to be
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
looking at where they're coming from and
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
not just assuming that if it says it's a
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
rescue or a shelter that those the
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
conditions are different because we are
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
unaware of any the most common thing we
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
get when we find people in a shelter
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
rescue situation well we're doing good
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
good and that may be their intent but
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
violating the law over and over again uh
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
is not an ex excuse for doing
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
good and so you know I would ask you not
 
04:33:53.709 --> 04:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill if you feel strongly
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
about doing something with it I I think
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
you need to really um go over with a
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
fine to
 
04:34:04.510 --> 04:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
comb representative Murray thank you
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I did just have a brief
 
04:34:09.510 --> 04:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that there are um
 
04:34:11.629 --> 04:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
animals coming from puppy mills from
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
other states and I I have no idea where
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're coming from I I okay I don't
 
04:34:17.390 --> 04:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
know where any of these animals are
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
coming from I see I mean I know a
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
physical I can get you physical
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
addresses but I don't know what the
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
conditions are that they're being raised
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
under or where they're coming from oh I
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
see that was my question that you had
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned a list of states so if follow
 
04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
up if I may sure and I might my other
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
question was are there animals coming
 
04:34:41.551 --> 04:34:41.561 align:start position:0%
from outside of the United States I I
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
believe that when we've looked at some
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
of these things there are animals that
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
are coming from outside of the United
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
States going to other locations within
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
the United States and then coming into
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire and I can tell you that
 
04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
particularly with the rescues and
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
shelters there needs to be a a a CVI
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
certificate of Veterinary
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
inspection we have a very very high
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
error rate um for the the
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
shelters those are
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
continuously uh filled out incorrectly
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
and do not give us the information that
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
we have we need to
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:35:27.390 --> 04:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper for taking my
 
04:35:31.869 --> 04:35:31.879 align:start position:0%
question so it sounds like one to tackle
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
this much larger problem you've
 
04:35:35.230 --> 04:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
identified a problem with shelters
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
sounds like we need to to to look more
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
carefully at that obviously there are
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
some issues around I assume interstate
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
commerce that limit our ability to to to
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
regulate some of that Commerce but uh
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about from hearing a
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
little bit of your testimonies it sounds
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
like it's this idea that well because we
 
04:35:55.470 --> 04:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
can't address the whole problem then we
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even try to address one part
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the problem and so I hear what you're
 
04:36:00.990 --> 04:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
saying about the larger problem and I
 
04:36:02.189 --> 04:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
think we need to go further in the
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
direction of looking at shelters uh I
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
think it's it is is um it's
 
04:36:07.869 --> 04:36:07.879 align:start position:0%
unquestionable when we look at the
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
numbers of abandoned dogs all around the
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
country that we are talking about a lot
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
of dogs that are found in communities
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
taken into shelters I like to think like
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
the the dog we adopted but so I mean is
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
that kind of the the response that we
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
can't solve the whole problem so we
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't try to solve one part of the
 
04:36:24.990 --> 04:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
problem I guess what I what I'm saying
 
04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
to you is I don't think the problem has
 
04:36:28.160 --> 04:36:29.070 align:start position:0%
to you is I don't think the problem has
been

04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
identified people are say you're you're
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
being told these animals are coming from
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
puppy mills
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
but what do you have from a definition
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
of that what do you have as evidence
 
04:36:43.230 --> 04:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
that do happen we normally don't pass
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
laws just because you have
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
some some emotional uh feelings and and
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
people are saying this and is that even
 
04:36:56.189 --> 04:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know the these could be
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
animals that you know you have small
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
breeders in Texas and Florida and
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
wherever who are doing the breeding
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
these I mean I think when we think of
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
puppy mills we think of places with you
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
know a hundred dogs just turning out
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
other you know turning out puppies do
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
you have any evidence that that is what
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
is happening here it may be happening in
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
both cases it may not be but I I don't
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
think we should just pass laws
 
04:37:28.439 --> 04:37:29.949 align:start position:0%
think we should just pass laws
without

04:37:29.949 --> 04:37:29.959 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
um some evidence I do think that
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
ultimately it may be appropriate to say
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
there needs to be proof for both of
 
04:37:41.429 --> 04:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
these entities for everybody who is a
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
pet vendor and indeed the shelters are
 
04:37:43.600 --> 04:37:44.390 align:start position:0%
pet vendor and indeed the shelters are
pet

04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
pet
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
vendors um it's it's you know generally
 
04:37:49.390 --> 04:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
not our job to say well geez these
 
04:37:52.590 --> 04:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
people are paying too much we don't B
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
ban mercedesbenz dealerships in New
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we think people are
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
paying too much for a car so is that
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
where you want to go with this or are we
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
worried about the conditions which I
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
think are legitimate of how an animal is
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
raised but you can't do that just based
 
04:38:10.109 --> 04:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
on testimony at least I don't believe
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
you should thank you representative NAB
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question are puppy mills to
 
04:38:20.189 --> 04:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
find in statute or by your department or
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
by the department of no and even if you
 
04:38:25.629 --> 04:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
think of you know that that idea of a
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
puppy mill being a place where you just
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
have you know cages and cages of dogs
 
04:38:33.390 --> 04:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
are being bred turning out puppies we
 
04:38:36.269 --> 04:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
don't have any of those in New Hampshire
 
04:38:38.551 --> 04:38:38.561 align:start position:0%
so there aren't at least not that we're
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
aware of and I and I think we really are
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
talking about imported animals here um
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
so if that is a concern and I don't see
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
why it wouldn't be then we need to
 
04:38:54.429 --> 04:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
really better Define that in general and
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
not just give one type of of entity a a
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
pass when the other one doesn't have it
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
um there was a question uh when is my
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
mind and out again so representative
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
kraton uh thank you commissioner I
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time again today
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think Discerning what you've just
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
said is that you have no evidence in the
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
five pet stores in New Hampshire of this
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
type of abuse is that correct or or not
 
04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
correct they tend to
 
04:39:33.789 --> 04:39:33.799 align:start position:0%
be fined less for conditions than many
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
of our shelters
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
are um they have at times paperwork
 
04:39:40.160 --> 04:39:41.310 align:start position:0%
are um they have at times paperwork
issues

04:39:41.310 --> 04:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to dogs and cats we
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
have very few issues there we do have
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
more issues with um people fostering
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
animals against the law with the
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
conditions not being up to Snuff many
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know there are there are bigger
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
facilities there are smaller facilities
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're all over the board some of these
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
are you know people who who truly do
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
intend to do
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
good but don't have the physical or the
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
financial abilities to actually do
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
things according to the laws of the
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and that tends to
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
be a problem so there are an awful lot
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
of uh things out there we regulate that
 
04:40:25.470 --> 04:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
believe me if you could find somebody
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
who would else who would like to deal
 
04:40:29.948 --> 04:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
with pet pet vending I would be glad to
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
pass that off in a minute but we're
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
doing the task that we have been been um
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
than given and to some degree funded
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
again this is one of those things where
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
I talk about do we do the everything we
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
could um probably not we'd like to do
 
04:40:52.510 --> 04:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
more inspections would' like to do get
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
out there more but we have a limited
 
04:40:57.868 --> 04:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
staff our pet pet vending our animal
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
database um program by the way uh is
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to be coming online soon it's
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
starting next next Monday testing with
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
some of the veterinarians so we're
 
04:41:09.310 --> 04:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
getting there and that's going to going
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
to help but um yeah I don't have any
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
evidence to tell you that you know any
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
one type of business here is better than
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
the other in doing so all right thank
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you and uh representative ktoa
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
has a has a question thank you madam
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you commissioner
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify something so
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
pet vendors and Retail pet
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
stores do they need to have health
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
certificates to transfer the animals and
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
do shelters and rescues also have to
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
have the same requirement any animal tra
 
04:41:48.760 --> 04:41:50.470 align:start position:0%
have the same requirement any animal tra
transferred

04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:41:55.230 --> 04:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
from a a pet store has to have a
 
04:41:57.070 --> 04:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
certificate for
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
transfer um rescu
 
04:42:02.750 --> 04:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
shelters have to have them for animals
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
that were not born in New Hampshire but
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
they get that one exemption the one
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
difference is if it was a New Hampshire
 
04:42:13.628 --> 04:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
born animal they do not need to have
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that certificate
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
followup uh commissioner and thank you
 
04:42:21.550 --> 04:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair um why would they get an
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
exemption if a puppy or kitten was born
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire when New Hampshire pet
 
04:42:29.470 --> 04:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
vendors don't get that pass you would
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
have to ask the legislators who passed
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
that um exemption many many years ago
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
because I have no idea we can't really
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
wrap our our heads around that
 
04:42:45.788 --> 04:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
either thank you representative
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
Duty yes thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner so um in my first term
 
04:42:55.510 --> 04:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
um about four years ago we also had a
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
retail Bill and at that time things were
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
a little different and I remember my
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
inbox being inundated with um probably
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
close to 100 emails most of them from
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
Missouri Texas Alabama Mississippi all
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh from people who were against the bill
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
because they imported animals in at the
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time it was it's been my
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
understanding since then that most of
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
the the breeders in the in New Hampshire
 
04:43:29.910 --> 04:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh have no problem selling their dogs I
 
04:43:32.670 --> 04:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
mean most of their dogs are sold even
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh before before they arrive so
 
04:43:38.910 --> 04:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a good indication I
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
mean my my question is is if you live in
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
Mississippi and you have to sell your
 
04:43:47.670 --> 04:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
animals into New Hampshire whereas if
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're a New Hampshire breeder all your
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
animals are taken isn't that a pretty
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
good indication that one might be a
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
puppy mill and the other is a
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
responsible breeder I mean if we just
 
04:44:00.670 --> 04:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
had to look at
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
something perhaps um but again without
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
knowing the particulars all I can tell
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
you is that animals transferred into the
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
state more go to the shelters than go to
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
pet stores can I have one followup
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
follow uh also during that hearing um
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
which was was quite crowded at at the
 
04:44:28.190 --> 04:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
time I was surprised to hear from the
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist from a uh an animal lobbyist um
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
that um shelters were buying were
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
getting in um animals from puppy mills
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
because they felt that they had to do
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
this to to save uh to save the animal um
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
would do you think that this bill should
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
be amended to include uh
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
shelters I think that
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
the I'd love what I'd love to see is
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
just Banning the import of cats and dogs
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
from out of state but that's the
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
um the interstate commerce issue that's
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
why I think though we
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
could um require certain conditions
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
California you can't import a hog unless
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
it you know has X number feet and can
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
turn around the chicken has to be able
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
to spread its wings and not hit the
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
sides of the cages so California was
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
successful in that I'm not sure that's
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
the best thing for you know the consumer
 
04:45:38.830 --> 04:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
particularly a pork consumer because uh
 
04:45:40.510 --> 04:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to afford that pork
 
04:45:43.470 --> 04:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
or or ptry product anymore and what are
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
you going to do feed your kids Twinkies
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper but at least it's
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to fill them up this totally
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
different thing here because this is
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
about pets so I have a less strong
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
feeling about saying yeah we could put
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
some conditions on how these animals are
 
04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
bred and raised to import into New
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they that would apply to
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
everybody um sounds like probably a long
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
and complicated process but um there may
 
04:46:15.390 --> 04:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
be examples of what uh other states have
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
done and that's what legislative
 
04:46:18.750 --> 04:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
research is
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
for thank you any other questions for
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jas seeing
 
04:46:24.798 --> 04:46:26.628 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jas seeing
none

04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
none
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
huh oh you representative
 
04:46:32.350 --> 04:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
kolin sorry thanks for taking my
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
question uh well thank you madam chair
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper U when I read this
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill it looks like it is placing
 
04:46:43.708 --> 04:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
limitations on like a handful of small
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire and when I
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
hear the discussion it seems like
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the issue is depending on uh
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
how we like perceive what the subjective
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
problem is is that you know it to me it
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
seems like this bill is limiting a
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
handful of small businesses and could
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
possibly benefit the more institutional
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
side am I right to think that uh it
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
certainly would appear that that is a a
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
possibility possible outcome as I said I
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
think this is a limitation of trade
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
because we're not setting up you know
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that emotional part where
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
none of us like to hear about puppy
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
mills but without any evidence that um
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
this will do anything to that except
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
eventually it's it stop stops the
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
expansion of the the pet stores and it
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
eventually takes those businesses away
 
04:47:46.350 --> 04:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
unless you can have it as
 
04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
multigenerational that's the Practical
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
effect effect without any actual impact
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
on how dogs are raised representative
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair well just a
 
04:47:58.350 --> 04:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
question to follow up on representative
 
04:48:02.350 --> 04:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
kulan's question uh in in today's market
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
my impression is that most pet stores
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
are chain stores now I mean I I dare say
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
there were very few momand popop pet
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
stores anywhere in America anymore most
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
of them as you said so when we talk
 
04:48:17.070 --> 04:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
about what is it that's being uh
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
regulated and if we're talking about a
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
bill that would favor larger
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
institutional um commercial sites over
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
for example small breeders I this bill
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that right because most uh
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
most pet stores as opposed to small
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
breeders are chain stores correct cor
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm I wish I had the numbers
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
here but I can think in my own community
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
of of Hudson there are two locations
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
that I believe are pet stores
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that this number of five
 
04:48:53.310 --> 04:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
is actually correct unless they're
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
incorporated as shelters I'm not sure I
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't think they are but again that's
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
something that I think needs to be um to
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
be really looked at again is what are we
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
really talking about here how are these
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
ownerships uh made up some of the
 
04:49:13.910 --> 04:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
larger pet stores don't actually sell
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
dogs or
 
04:49:18.230 --> 04:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
cats um they sell things that go along
 
04:49:20.590 --> 04:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
with them but this is another another
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
problem in the bill which we don't have
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
the capability of doing which is to
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
track the ownership how am I supposed to
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
track the ownership of any of these pet
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
stores you know if you know um Petco is
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
selling dogs and
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
cats their stock is being traded all the
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
time sometimes corporations are bought
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
out and now that's my responsibility to
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
figure out any of that even to
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
transfer um the ownership it may be a a
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
business that's
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and you know suddenly
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
somebody buys out the corporation how am
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
I supposed to know that it now has a new
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
so that's another thing that I forgot to
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
mention was the whole issue of the
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture TR tracking
 
04:50:12.270 --> 04:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
ownership thank
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%

04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%

of Veterinary information that's what we
 
04:50:39.150 --> 04:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
already mentioned that's how we find out
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
where these uh pet stores that buy from
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
puppy mills are on bailing up Benji for

you know where the dogs are coming from
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
like he already mentioned all the
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
Breeders listed as associated with the
 
04:50:57.548 --> 04:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
pet stores sold puppies or kittens to

04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
information isn't here but I'm just
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to read you a just a fraction of
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
it Family Pet and Aquarium Somerset

on the certificate of Veterinary
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
information the other thing that really
 
04:51:32.270 --> 04:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be cleared up is that there is
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
a difference between a pet shop in an
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
animal shelter it's in our state law I'm
 
04:51:39.390 --> 04:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
not really sure um where the speaker

previous to me was getting their
 
04:51:42.990 --> 04:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
information but I'll cite my source
 
04:51:43.000 --> 04:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
information but I'll cite my source
right

that you
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
proceed okay so the next thing we should
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
clear up is we should all be familiar
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
with the economy of puppy mills puppy
 
04:52:49.270 --> 04:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
mills are dog breeders that prioritize
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
profit over the well-being of dogs we do
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
not need a legal definition of them they
 
04:52:54.548 --> 04:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
because once again we don't really have
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
a puppy mill problem in New Hampshire
 
04:52:57.070 --> 04:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
anymore people aren't reading these
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
anymore and I'll give you the history of
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
that really quickly they rack up USD
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
violations in these other states for
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
illegal vet practices and neglect but
 
04:53:05.470 --> 04:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
they regularly fight them off it's no
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
big deal and they continue to make
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
massive profits it's a multi-billion
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
dollar industry ethical dog breeding on
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
the other hand isn't nearly as
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
profitable it's an incredible amount of
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
work and a huge investment people choose
 
04:53:18.750 --> 04:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
to do animal breeding most often out of
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
love for Animals there is an enormous
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
demand for puppies and breeding would be
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
unprofitable if they sold to dog stores
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
so it's common knowledge real dog
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
breeders never sell to pet stores you're
 
04:53:29.310 --> 04:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
going to hear that from other people New
 
04:53:30.830 --> 04:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire used to have a puppy mill
 
04:53:32.670 --> 04:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
problem a few years back but it gained
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
Mass attention after after this super
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
luxurious mansion was raided and they
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
found over 70 Great Danes and filthy
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
conditions of unbelievable neglect you
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
may have heard of this some going blind
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
in clearly suffering and starving
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
shortly after the news attention
 
04:53:46.990 --> 04:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu swore we'd never see
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
puppy milk cruelty again and tightened
 
04:53:50.990 --> 04:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
our breeding practices it seems New
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was leading the charge against
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
dog cruelty as plenty of States had yet
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
to catch up but those states that mass
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
breed puppies became the biggest sources
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
for our pet stores and a real problem
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
developed I mean not that the problem
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't already there but for example
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
Puppy Palace they they had a bunch of
 
04:54:08.430 --> 04:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
protesters out of there they got shut
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
down they came right back like like when
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
people know where their dogs are coming
 
04:54:13.868 --> 04:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
from they don't shop here and then these
 
04:54:15.788 --> 04:54:15.798 align:start position:0%
Shores get shut down due to lack of
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
demand because now people know these are
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
Poppy and I'll let you know why people
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't do that um these puppy mill dogs
 
04:54:24.990 --> 04:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
are often the result of inbreeding that
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
gives them lifelong genetic conditions
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
the their filthy conditions that they're
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
bred in regularly make these dogs sick
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
they make the New Hampshire residents
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
and dogs at interrup act with these pet
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
stores or their dogs ill we cannot allow
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
these pet stores to continue to deceive
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
our residents as to where they Source
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
our dogs we cannot allow them to
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
continue to treat our best friends with
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
such cruelty dogs have always been our
 
04:54:46.590 --> 04:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
best friend and that will never change
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
firstly to get ahead of that information
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
once again um there is a difference
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
between the animal shelters and the pet
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
dealers and we need to we need to
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
identify how this is going to affect Pet
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
Shops and how this is going to affect
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
animal shelters animal shelters in our
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
state law the difference is that like I
 
04:55:01.548 --> 04:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
said they're nonprofit versus these
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit Pet Shops so because it's not
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
going to limit the animal shelters it
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
can only increase demand for
 
04:55:13.150 --> 04:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
adoption okay secondly done right this
 
04:55:15.548 --> 04:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
bill will not limit breeders there are
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
ways to Define this bill without
 
04:55:19.948 --> 04:55:19.958 align:start position:0%
limiting a single breeder in which case
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
just like animal shelters this can only
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
increase demand for our New Hampshire
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
breeders for example in California since
 
04:55:29.070 --> 04:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
2020 only breeders and animal shelters
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
can sell dogs their legislature is very
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
similar the main difference is that they
 
04:55:36.548 --> 04:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
include a definition for breeders Al
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
separately alongside the retail ban of
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
pet sales protecting breeders rights
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a bill just like it
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
h8266 not the only way for example the
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
way that Vermont does it is they they
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
Define it by the amount of litters like
 
04:56:10.590 --> 04:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you do one or more litter then
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
you're a pet dealer you there's that
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
option too but I I'm going to support
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that we just Define it as true
 
04:56:19.470 --> 04:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
retail buying and selling that's real
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
simple therefore we can easily implement
 
04:56:23.708 --> 04:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
this bill in a way that doesn't restrict
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
breeders just like many other states
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
have if it doesn't restrict breeders it
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
can only increase their demand therefore
 
04:56:31.470 --> 04:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
breeders will make more sales should
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
they choose to meet this demand done on
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
right this bill can only help readers
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's a simple matter of using the same
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
definitions that other states have
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
already utilized 15 cities in Colorado
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
already have retail pet store bands
 
04:56:45.270 --> 04:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's 15 different examples of this
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
working and 15 different legal samples
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
to draw from in making any amendments
 
04:56:51.628 --> 04:56:51.638 align:start position:0%
one of them adopted it as early as 2012
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
and the most recent just last year there
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
are cities and towns in M six cities and
 
04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
towns in Maine that have already adopted
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
the retail pet store band as well
 
04:57:02.110 --> 04:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
including Min Minneapolis last year
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
Providence and plenty other cities in
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island have similar legislations
 
04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
the entire state of New York has banned
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
the retail sale of cats and dogs that's
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
pretty close to home Oregon's done it
 
04:57:14.430 --> 04:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
too Washington in 2023 cities in Alabama
 
04:57:17.070 --> 04:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
Georgia Idaho Indiana Kentucky Michigan
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Nevada New Jersey Pennsylvania
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Texas Utah Wisconsin and
 
04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
Washington DC enacted retail pet store
 
04:57:26.470 --> 04:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
bands plenty of other states were
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
already on that list New Hampshire still
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
isn't Florida is I read a bunch of these
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
cities legislatures for their retail ban
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
on cat and dog sales and they're all
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same they separately
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
Define breeders animal shelters and pet
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
stores and ban the pet stores from
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
selling unless the dog comes from an
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
animal shelter given this list covers
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
more than half the states in the United
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
States of America and over half of our
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors and that increasingly more and
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
more states and cities are adopting
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
similar bills it's really popular the
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
news articles are always the same
 
04:57:58.270 --> 04:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
people's reactions are always the same
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
this is a huge win for everyone people
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
are ecstatic and proud to leave the
 
04:58:03.548 --> 04:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
charge in Animal Welfare this should
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
come as no surprise people have terrible
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
experiences with puppy meals and pet
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
stores these businesses are always lying
 
04:58:11.070 --> 04:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
to their customers and hiding behind
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
lemon laws only not to pay out here are
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
just a couple excerpts from reviews
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
pulled from a pet store in Nashville in
 
04:58:18.390 --> 04:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we got a beautiful golden
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
retriever which our family loves when we
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
got her she was very weak in her hind
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
legs and though she though she had been
 
04:58:26.430 --> 04:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
as though she had been cooped up for
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
quite some time after finding blood in
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
her messes we ran her to a vet and found
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
hookworms this couple was offered their
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
money back however they declined because
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
who wants to get rid of their dog after
 
04:58:38.510 --> 04:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
facing expensive vet bills stressing the
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
couple to tears here's another one do
 
04:58:42.910 --> 04:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
not buy bought a baby Basset Hound from
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
here for a whole week she was having
 
04:58:46.350 --> 04:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
diarrhea and blood in her stool three
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
weeks later and $10,000 of vet bills
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
into this poor puppy she had to be put
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
down we are awaiting compensation from
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
the store and considering legal action
 
04:58:57.390 --> 04:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
did you hear that $10,000 in vet bills
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the dog still dies and now they have
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
to fight for their compensation but at
 
04:59:03.788 --> 04:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
least New Hampshire has lemon lost right
 
04:59:05.310 --> 04:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
because the lemon laws help these people
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
so much that's the problem with lemon
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
laws no one wants to refund their new
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
family member they've grown attached to
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
no refund is going to fix a child's
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
heart after they watch their best friend
 
04:59:16.590 --> 04:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
die due to our lacking legislation when
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
you have such a great influx of puppy
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
mill puppies there are going to be
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
plenty genetic disorders that test these
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
laws dogs will die some will die past
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
the warranty period and according to the
 
04:59:27.788 --> 04:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
reviews on these New Hampshire pet
 
04:59:30.030 --> 04:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
stores it's incredibly common in a real
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
legal mess to clean up for the cat
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
lovers here's another one completely
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
broke my heart when I purchased a sweet
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
little kitten there a week in he was
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
weak in lethargic took him to emergency
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
vet two times for anyone here who was
 
04:59:42.910 --> 04:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to never had to bring your
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
animal to an emergency vet let me just
 
04:59:46.270 --> 04:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
tell you it really hurts seeing your
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
animal suffer like that not knowing if
 
04:59:48.990 --> 04:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to make it through the
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
night really breaks your heart this is a
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
regular occurrence for these pet store
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
shoppers and we all know
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
whyley yes um you had indicated seven
 
05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
minutes on your card yes um would you
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
wrap up please your testimony yeah
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go ahead and skip the
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
reviews basically no one is saved by
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
these lemon laws it's incredibly common
 
05:00:10.750 --> 05:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
experience pet stores love to use these
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
as a means of promising quality knowing
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
full well full well their genetic risks
 
05:00:17.708 --> 05:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
are lifelong and even if a lemon law
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
secures a family refund they still just
 
05:00:22.030 --> 05:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
lost their family dog preventatively so
 
05:00:22.990 --> 05:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually how a lot of our
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
activists get started we get screwed
 
05:00:26.190 --> 05:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
over by the pet stores and then we just
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
want Justice lemon laws do not stop
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
puppy mil pups from coming into New
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it literally just changes the
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
subject the two final most consider
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
important considerations how does this
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
affect New Hampshire customers how does
 
05:00:39.470 --> 05:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
it affect out ofate puppy mills outof
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
State puppy mills Mass breed and sell to
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
pet stores all over the country or
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
through online platforms when you walk
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
into a pet store you are certainly
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
buying a puppy mill puppy everyone knows
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
reputable breeders don't sell to pet
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
stores on the other hand and on the uh
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
when you buy online there's a good
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
chance that you could still run into a
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
breeder you could still buy from a
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
breeder so obviously when you walk into
 
05:01:01.948 --> 05:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
the pet store you have the huge problem
 
05:01:04.030 --> 05:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
of impulse buying that we've already
 
05:01:05.548 --> 05:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
talked about if you get rid of pet
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
stores you've gotten rid of a huge
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
source of demand for puppy mills the
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
biggest source of impulse purchases when
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
you get rid of one source of demand
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
obviously the most determined Shoppers
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
go to other sources the three being
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
animal shelters breeders and online pet
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
stores but this weeds out a lot of the
 
05:01:20.830 --> 05:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
impulse buyers can you imagine what
 
05:01:22.270 --> 05:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
impulse Pet shopping does to our
 
05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
shelters it obviously fills them up so
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
by implementing this bill we will
 
05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
decrease uh impulse pet buys therefore
 
05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
making sure dogs make it to the correct
 
05:01:32.910 --> 05:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
homes and decreasing puppy mill demand
 
05:01:34.310 --> 05:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
some people today might try to argue
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
that some people will go online that
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
this will increase puppy mill demand
 
05:01:39.868 --> 05:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
that is ridiculous the pet store and the
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
online store both buy from the same
 
05:01:43.868 --> 05:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
poppy Mills overall demands to the poppy
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
Mills are going to be decreased and
 
05:01:47.788 --> 05:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
impulse buys are going to be limited if
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
this wasn't the case we wouldn't see so
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
many cities and states implementing this
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
bill now that we're all on the same page
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
about that how is it going to
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
infect can you just finish up please
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely our dogs won't have nearly as
 
05:02:01.708 --> 05:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
many genetic conditions all the stories
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
I read where people get their dog and
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
have a die a couple weeks later that
 
05:02:06.750 --> 05:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
won't happen nearly as much our Shoppers
 
05:02:08.590 --> 05:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
won't be as susceptible to impulse buy
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
saving them heartbreak our new dog
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
owners are going to become more informed
 
05:02:13.230 --> 05:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
given they have to actually do a little
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
research before they buy dog should not
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
be purchased on a whim our breeders are
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
going to see more customers our pet
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
shelters are going to see more adoptions
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to see less surrenders our
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will appreciate that these
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofits don't need as much money from
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
Grants because the shelters have less
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
stress our veterinary hospitals are
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
going to have a smaller load all dogs
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
are going to have a lower chance of
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
getting sick without the these puppy
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
mill dogs spreading their common
 
05:02:35.868 --> 05:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
sicknesses everywhere this provides
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
benefit to literally everyone in the
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
picture except the cruel puppy mills out
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
of state which it will decrease demand
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
for thank you for your time I will
 
05:02:44.190 --> 05:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%

cook and you've requested five minutes
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
to speak we have still several um pink
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
slips here so uh I'd like to get through
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
this as quickly as we can as time is
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
waning and the weather is not
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
abating thank you madam chair I will
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to make my comments brief in
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
addition to being a horse owner just for
 
05:03:22.510 --> 05:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
background I am a hobby breeder of
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
Siberian huskys been in New Hampshire

for 40 plus years not even coming close
 
05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
to the current definition of a pet
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
vendor um I'm well versed in the rsas
 
05:03:37.708 --> 05:03:37.718 align:start position:0%
having served since 2006 as Governor's
 
05:03:39.708 --> 05:03:39.718 align:start position:0%

Humane treatment of
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%

the Granite State and the New Hampshire
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
mushers Association on that commission I
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
am here today speaking for myself and
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
not for the commission I am testifying
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this
 
05:04:05.310 --> 05:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
bill the legislature as you all well
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
know has worked very hard to come up
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
with the original definition of a pet
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
vendor what this bill does is this
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
synonymously makes a pet vendor into a
 
05:04:19.948 --> 05:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
retail pet store by adding this simple
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
definition that you sell your dogs out
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
of a physical facility if you are a
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
breeder you obviously have a physical
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
facility that does not make me a retail
 
05:04:29.000 --> 05:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
facility that does not make me a retail
pet

05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
store

05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is to raise for the
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee the reality of the subject of
 
05:04:41.520 --> 05:04:43.030 align:start position:0%
committee the reality of the subject of
retail

05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
rescue commissioner Jasper in his
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony before the Senate two weeks
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
ago uh had some astonishing numbers in
 
05:04:54.670 --> 05:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
terms of dogs that are imported to the
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire both by rescues
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
and by shelters the number is is in the
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
thousands 1900 1600 dogs known to be
 
05:05:09.310 --> 05:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
imported by rescues and shelters retail
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
rescue is a real thing I'm certainly no
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
fan of pet stores I would never go to
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
one I am not one and I do not support
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.510 --> 05:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishes Reta in in fact to show how
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
out of touch the wording in this bill is
 
05:05:32.670 --> 05:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
when the provision that says that a
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
retail pet store can have a shelter or
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
rescue display dogs at their facility
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
those are two sources of animals that
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
are competing for the same Market they
 
05:05:46.990 --> 05:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
are competing for the same person the
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
only difference is that RSA 437
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
specifically exempts animal shelter
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
facilities from the regulations of
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
437 so if you imagine you've now got a
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
let's say the retail pet store since it
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
starts as a
 
05:06:11.160 --> 05:06:14.590 align:start position:0%
starts as a
um

05:06:14.590 --> 05:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
um um excuse me the retail pet store
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
since it started as a uh pet
 
05:06:23.840 --> 05:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
since it started as a uh pet
vendor

05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
05:06:26.400 --> 05:06:29.030 align:start position:0%
vendor
if

05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
rescues import dogs shelters import dogs
 
05:06:42.990 --> 05:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
the only difference is that the shelters
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
are exempt from providing the health
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
certificates that are required for other
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
transfers of dogs in the state of New
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the methodology section at the
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
footnote of the bill specifically shows
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
why this bill does not solve the problem
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
that it reports to
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
solve the there is an incorrect
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
statement there that um no local breeder
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
is currently or will be allowed to
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
transfer more than 30 animals in a year
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
that is not what the definition of the
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
pet vendor is there is no cap it's you
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
just become a pet vendor when you
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.958 --> 05:07:29.070 align:start position:0%
 
30

05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
30
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
if the and in fact the methodology
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
admits that out of state and therefore
 
05:07:37.150 --> 05:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
unregulated sources of animals would
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
become the best option for New Hampshire
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that that is in the
 
05:07:45.788 --> 05:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in fact if you go to the
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
continued uh extent of that logic if you
 
05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
now have capped any and
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
all sales of dogs from facilities to be
 
05:08:04.350 --> 05:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
no more than 30 dogs per
 
05:08:08.190 --> 05:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
year if you have an existing demand that
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
is not going to diminish and a set cap
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
on any one facility selling any more
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
than 30 that is going to automatically
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
increase the demand for more people who
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
might only be able to sell 30 dogs in a
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
year that limits the cap that cap limits
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
their ability to sell enough animals to
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
make the financial gain that they would
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
like to be
 
05:08:36.270 --> 05:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
making and all the while the animal
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
shelters are exempt from those
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
regulations under
 
05:08:44.110 --> 05:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
437 so final thing on the site on scene
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
transfers and the online transfers of
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
dogs one under the uh wording of the
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
animal the federal Animal Welfare act if
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
you have form if you maintain four
 
05:09:01.628 --> 05:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
intact females four intact breeding dogs
 
05:09:05.470 --> 05:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
and make one site unseen sale then you
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
are required to be registered as a
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
license facility with the
 
05:09:13.230 --> 05:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
USDA so for those people who think that
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
oh it's just going to throw everybody to
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know online sales then it's for
 
05:09:22.190 --> 05:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
the USDA to step up and enforce the
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
regulations that are already in place
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
for them to enforce to make sure that
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
online and uh site unseen sales uh do
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
not have
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
happen I believe that the committee
 
05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
would be well well served by considering
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to be inexpedient to legislate
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any other
 
05:09:46.830 --> 05:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you madam chair and thanks
 
05:09:51.628 --> 05:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
for sharing your testimony so you as a
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
small dog breeder you know would you say
 
05:09:58.110 --> 05:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
by this legislation capping you at 30
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
dogs could you say that this is the
 
05:10:01.160 --> 05:10:02.548 align:start position:0%
dogs could you say that this is the
institutional

05:10:02.548 --> 05:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
institutional
 
05:10:05.948 --> 05:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
side of things uh you know trying to
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
legislate a monopoly over your operation
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to limit you to 30
 
05:10:14.548 --> 05:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
dogs what if you had a good year and you
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
raised 32 dogs do you think you should
 
05:10:19.270 --> 05:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
be able to sell 32
 
05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
dogs I yes I should be able to and I
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to under the law the only
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
difference is I would need to be
 
05:10:26.350 --> 05:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
licensed by the Department of
 
05:10:27.390 --> 05:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
Agriculture in the state of New
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gotcha that makes no
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
difference to me although I have never
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
in 40 years even approach that limit uh
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
with our breeding
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
program representative ger thank you
 
05:10:42.708 --> 05:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just I want to clarify
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
that in terms of we run into these uh
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of lines that get drawn right
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
between a
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
smallscale uh private transaction as
 
05:10:53.948 --> 05:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to when we cross the line into a
 
05:10:55.628 --> 05:10:55.638 align:start position:0%
business and I suppose it depends upon
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
the breed right but we're talking about
 
05:11:00.548 --> 05:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
certain breeds uh that could be sold for
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of money we're
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
looking at 30 dogs in a year uh doesn't
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
that clearly cross the line over into
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who's doing this as a source of
 
05:11:12.670 --> 05:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
income and isn't 30 dogs a year a
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
business level of transaction 30 dogs a
 
05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
year is a business level transaction but
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that does not make you a retail pet
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
store as redefined in this Bill thank
 
05:11:27.230 --> 05:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr cook thank you
 
05:11:30.120 --> 05:11:30.948 align:start position:0%

Stak hi I'm Elizabeth starno I'm from
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
der New Hampshire and I'm representing
 
05:12:00.958 --> 05:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
der New Hampshire and I'm representing
myself

05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I am here because I happen to work at
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
one of the five pet stores in New
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that does Source its dogs from
 
05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
puppy mills and what's being said here
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
today is that there's no evidence that
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
any of these stores are getting the dogs
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
from puppy mills but if you look up any
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
of puppies on the Run Puppy Palace fetch
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
a pet you will find hundreds of reviews
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
you'll find records you'll find um
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
breeders that have been blacklisted and
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even have dogs at their
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
facilities and I even inter I even asked
 
05:12:36.030 --> 05:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
my manager personally what the name of
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
the broker he was used and then the
 
05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
broker is who's between it's like a
 
05:12:41.788 --> 05:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
broker for anything else they between
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
the puppy mill and the pet store and he
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
said it was select puppies and if you
 
05:12:48.548 --> 05:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
look up select puppies they literally
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a single breeder who isn't a
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
puppy mill there's been investigations
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
done into their breeders which are all
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
across the Midwest like States we've
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
been hearing about um Louisiana Missouri
 
05:13:03.788 --> 05:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
those places came up a lot but during
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
the time that I worked there I saw that
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
more than half they were getting 28 dogs
 
05:13:10.830 --> 05:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
a week and more than half of the dogs
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
were very sick within days of it opening
 
05:13:15.070 --> 05:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
because I worked there when it first
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
opened so they had round worms hookworms
 
05:13:17.958 --> 05:13:19.270 align:start position:0%
opened so they had round worms hookworms
Giardia

05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
Giardia
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
coxidia one dog was was taken to an
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
emergency vet when he was 1 hour away
 
05:13:28.590 --> 05:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
from dying and when I I quit a few days
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
later I had quit because my manager when
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
we got the second group of dogs decided
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
that they didn't need to be quarantined
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
even though they were coming from out of
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
state so I believe the law is 48 hours
 
05:13:41.670 --> 05:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
they should be quarantined but they they
 
05:13:43.548 --> 05:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
weren't quarantined for even one hour
 
05:13:45.350 --> 05:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and they were obviously sick which means
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
that not just the dogs are going to end
 
05:13:50.548 --> 05:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
up sick but humans can get sick too and
 
05:13:52.190 --> 05:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
their kids at home can get sick their
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
animals at home can get sick these dogs
 
05:13:57.470 --> 05:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
are being the difference between a
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
shelter or a rescue and a pet store or a
 
05:14:02.990 --> 05:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
commercial breeding facility is that
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
puppy mills and large scale breeding
 
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
facilities are are they're producing
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
dogs for profit whereas shelters and
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
rescues are the Imports that are being
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
talked about are stray animals and
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned animals from other states that
 
05:14:18.510 --> 05:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
already exist and are being brought here
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
because we have right now we don't have
 
05:14:22.990 --> 05:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
as many stray animals as the other
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
states do but if we don't pass this bill
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and the other states around us continue
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
to then New Hampshire will become the
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
place in New England where everyone
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
comes to get a dog that that same day
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
for whatever purpose they want it for
 
05:14:41.470 --> 05:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
and another major difference between the
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
shelters and the pet stores is that a
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
shelter cares where their dogs end up
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
and most of the time if the person if
 
05:14:51.628 --> 05:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
the person ends up not being in good fit
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
with the dog they they have contracts
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
that make sure you bring the dog back to
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
the shelter whereas a pet store once
 
05:14:59.430 --> 05:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's out the door like they're not
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
taking it back we have like we have the
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
m- in-law here but the puppy palace I
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
watch them refuse to take back like many
 
05:15:08.670 --> 05:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
dogs that should have fallen within the
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
warranty they advertized but they once
 
05:15:12.190 --> 05:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
they're out the door and there's room
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
for another dog to come in that they can
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
make another few thousand dollars off of
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
like they're going to do that so we are
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
not talking about um Hogs or chickens or
 
05:15:25.390 --> 05:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
animal shelters that sell that sell dogs
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
they get from puppy mills we're talking
 
05:15:30.030 --> 05:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
about retail facilities and there's a
 
05:15:31.868 --> 05:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
major difference between a retail
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
facility and a shelter and even if we
 
05:15:35.948 --> 05:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
need to change some of the wording of
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill to make sure that actual
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
ethical breeders can continue to operate
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
as they are I think we definitely need a
 
05:15:45.788 --> 05:15:45.798 align:start position:0%
version of this build to pass soon or we
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
will become the only place in New
 
05:15:50.350 --> 05:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
England where people come to get dogs
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
that come from puppy mills and those
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
dogs will end up they'll end up dying
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
abandoned they'll end up at the animal
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
shelters that are already overflowing
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we're able to stop that so I
 
05:16:02.910 --> 05:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
definitely think that we should do that
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:16:11.230 --> 05:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
this afternoon like to call Bernie
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
Club good afternoon thank you for uh
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
providing the opportunity to speak Madam
 
05:16:28.948 --> 05:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
chair and the rest of the committee for
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
listening um I'll be very brief uh um
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper um covered quite a
 
05:16:38.430 --> 05:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
bit of my concern which was the allowing
 
05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
um rescues to be um displayed in pet
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
stores once pet stores were no longer
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
able to display puppies but
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
um I I kind of have a question for all
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
of you why did you become
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives right why why are you
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
doing this sitting here on a not so bad
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon um listen to all of us it's
 
05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
not for the money I know that it's not
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
for the the power and The Prestige of
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
being a representative in the state of
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh you're here because you
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
have some some sense of service and and
 
05:17:20.110 --> 05:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
and belief in the system in the state of
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as do I I'm on I'm on a
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
local school board so I get it you're
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing your time and you're you're
 
05:17:30.270 --> 05:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do something good I guess I
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
don't see the point of this bill we
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with pet stores per
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
se and I think a lot of this is trying
 
05:17:40.830 --> 05:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
to tug at
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
heartstrings as as has been mentioned um
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
I can tell you a little anecdote which I
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to include but there were
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
so many sad sad stories 1968 I was 8
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
years old and went into a do pet store
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
at the mall in hyanis
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts my sister and I walked out
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
with a darling little samed puppy got
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
home my mother took one look at it and
 
05:18:10.110 --> 05:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
she said turn around and bring it
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
back and that's because she was a
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
responsible parent and knew and she used
 
05:18:19.788 --> 05:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to educate me about
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
impulse buying um you know not
 
05:18:26.430 --> 05:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
researching what you do so I I guess I
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
just I ask you not to be manipulated by
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
the sad stories and the the death and
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
the dying and the all those things that
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
um are horrible but it's not something
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's happening here and and I think
 
05:18:45.868 --> 05:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
you're hearing from a lot of citizens
 
05:18:45.878 --> 05:18:47.430 align:start position:0%
you're hearing from a lot of citizens
that

05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
um believe in our system that it works
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
and that um there are other ways to
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
address the problem of and and puppy
 
05:19:00.270 --> 05:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
mills I think is a misnomer also they're
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
commercial breeders is what they're
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
called um across the country so puppy
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
mills is one of those emotional terms as
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
well it's not really um a defined term
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
so um that's basically it and uh if you
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:22.110 --> 05:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
paten so I just wanted to ask are you a
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
commercial breeder no I'm a a hobby
 
05:19:27.310 --> 05:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
breeder I breed I show I've been
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
breeding Irish terriers for 30 plus
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
years um um
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes I have two litters in a
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
year sometimes I don't have any litters
 
05:19:41.430 --> 05:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm small very small scale
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so it but you've
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
been in New Hampshire the whole time oh
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes yeah so I talked to uh
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
someone that is an advocate for this
 
05:19:53.110 --> 05:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill and uh just really didn't have it
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
on my radar at all um you know in that
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
sense and and then I just went back I
 
05:20:00.750 --> 05:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
born and raised in New Hampshire and I
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
remember pet stores they were in the
 
05:20:06.030 --> 05:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
mall and we used to go and I remember so
 
05:20:09.548 --> 05:20:09.558 align:start position:0%
much of that that is completely gone now
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and to include there's no such thing of
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
them even in um you know big pet stores
 
05:20:18.070 --> 05:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
that they have of course you know the
 
05:20:20.190 --> 05:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
cats and stuff like that that are there
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
and they told me where I should not go
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
and and gave me a little bit of insight
 
05:20:28.510 --> 05:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the reason why those pet stores don't
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
exist anymore in that you know what I
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
remember remember when I was little so
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the woman that
 
05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
worked there is it's not happening here
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't even realize there was one here
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to be honest so you
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm not familiar with with the
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
store she's talking about or the
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
situation I the only pet store I know is
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
up by me in Plymouth they don't sell
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
dogs or cats they've got Birds fish and
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
maybe mice or so I some some rodent I
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
avoid that
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
section there there's a reason I have
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
Terriers I don't like rodents um but um
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean I I don't know her
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
personal experience um but I do wonder
 
05:21:11.548 --> 05:21:11.558 align:start position:0%
if she reported them to the proper
 
05:21:15.150 --> 05:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
authorities after finding sick animals
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
she gave me a thumbs up she did
 
05:21:17.400 --> 05:21:18.430 align:start position:0%
she gave me a thumbs up she did
representative

05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and it it's
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
connected to what representative Penza
 
05:21:26.190 --> 05:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
was just asking about I was going to say
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
you had stated that that we don't have a
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
problem I think we've heard direct
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that there is a problem we can
 
05:21:33.670 --> 05:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
argue about the scope of the problem but
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we can legitimately
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
argue that there isn't a problem we've
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
heard from a couple of of of hobby
 
05:21:40.830 --> 05:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
breeders and we've heard from someone
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
who actually works in these conditions
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
specifically and I don't think that that
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
testimony ought to be dismissed as as
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
as simply tugging at at heartstrings but
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
the other question about uh whether we
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem or not is do we wait
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
until we have a problem we we've heard
 
05:22:00.430 --> 05:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
ample evidence that states around us and
 
05:22:01.948 --> 05:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of states across the country and
 
05:22:03.548 --> 05:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
cities across the country are enacting
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
bands like this and as we know with our
 
05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
out ofate waste problem we become the
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
place that those things go when other
 
05:22:12.670 --> 05:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
states have decided that these are not
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable practices so uh do do we
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
wait until it becomes uh a problem
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
because we become The Dumping Ground for
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
things other states have decided they're
 
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
not going to do anymore um well first of
 
05:22:27.310 --> 05:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
all I think New Hampshire is a unique
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
State because we're small and we can um
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate things and work on them other
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
than repeatedly enacting new laws and
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
new laws and just getting things more
 
05:22:41.548 --> 05:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
complicated that that's just part of it
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
but um if you refer back to commissioner
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
Jasper's testimony he said that there
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
are way more rescues coming in um than
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
from quote unquote puppy mills and while
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
that's a problem if they're given the
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
information they can crack if dogs can't
 
05:23:02.708 --> 05:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
come in sick to the state by law so they
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
can enforce that um and the the rescues
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
I mean he he talked about or someone
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned retail rescue um they breed
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
dogs for rescue now that's that's done
 
05:23:19.470 --> 05:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
in the South we don't we don't have
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
enough puppies in our shelters and and
 
05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
rescues and dogs are being bred as
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
rescues to um come up and tug at
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
heartstrings and go oh look at the this
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
poor little dog it doesn't have a home
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's that's a problem thank
 
05:23:42.910 --> 05:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you for
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony this afternoon thank you
 
05:23:47.310 --> 05:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:23:49.948 --> 05:23:49.958 align:start position:0%
time I'd like to call Joan
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:26.708 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

05:24:26.708 --> 05:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
so my name is Joan O'Brien and I live in
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
so my name is Joan O'Brien and I live in
Amherst

05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
Amherst
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
today um I'm just heard from
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper I think he nailed it
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do is it will stop
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
the expansion of a problematic sales um
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
model for
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
dogs and um that really sums it up right
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
there we want to stop the
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
expansion there's been a lot of talk
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
about the difference between a retail
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
store and a rescue or or a Shel shter
 
05:25:03.948 --> 05:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
let's keep in mind that the retail store
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
has a profit motive and the shelter and
 
05:25:09.190 --> 05:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
rescue in theory are not supposed to
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
have a profit motive they are supposed
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
to be rehoming homeless animals and not
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
making a profit on either end if they
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
are well that's a different issue
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
they're you know if they're a nonprofit
 
05:25:23.948 --> 05:25:23.958 align:start position:0%
they should be you know evaluated and
 
05:25:27.150 --> 05:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
audited for that we're trying to solve
 
05:25:28.990 --> 05:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
the problem of the retail pet stores
 
05:25:30.910 --> 05:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill seven other states have
 
05:25:33.070 --> 05:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
done it 400 towns and municipalities
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
have done it and it's working
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
well we heard from Ellie who worked at
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
the store that it's well documented that
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of dogs in these stores
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
come from puppy
 
05:25:47.110 --> 05:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
mills they can only fill their cages
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
with a variety of of popular dogs that
 
05:25:52.548 --> 05:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
are that young by using puppy
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
mills they treat them like
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
products and the store is the preferred
 
05:25:59.910 --> 05:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
Outlet because you never see where the
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
dogs came from from and you never see
 
05:26:05.590 --> 05:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.190 --> 05:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
live the salespeople will say oh don't
 
05:26:11.948 --> 05:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
worry all of our burritos are USDA
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
licensed this may sound good but USDA
 
05:26:17.708 --> 05:26:17.718 align:start position:0%
standards are shockingly low inspections
 
05:26:21.070 --> 05:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
are rare and enforcement is is lacking
 
05:26:23.190 --> 05:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's legal to keep dogs in cages that
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
are hardly big enough for them to turn
 
05:26:26.830 --> 05:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
around for their entire lives that's
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
okay by the
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
USDA stores will also tell you oh he's
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
AKC registered so he's a great healthy
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
dog with no genetic defects and being
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
registered with the AKC doesn't ensure
 
05:26:41.708 --> 05:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
that your dog is healthy um while they
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
do inspect some breeders there's just
 
05:26:47.110 --> 05:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
far too many for them to inspect them
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
all and they also have an interest in uh
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
new peer bread dogs being brought into
 
05:26:53.990 --> 05:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the world because they can collect a
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
registration fee every time that happens
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a conflict of
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
interest there as
 
05:26:59.520 --> 05:27:02.190 align:start position:0%
interest there as
well

05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh being licensed by the state of New
 
05:27:05.788 --> 05:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has never meant that a retail
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
pet store wasn't selling puppy mill dogs
 
05:27:10.830 --> 05:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
the state does not inspect the places
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
where the dogs come from the stores look
 
05:27:15.230 --> 05:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
great I mean many of them are beautiful
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
and clean inside and they pass
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
inspections but the puppies don't spend
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
very long there one to two weeks tops is
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
what the stores want um they want to
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
move them out before they they're not
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
cute anymore and so what really matters
 
05:27:29.708 --> 05:27:29.718 align:start position:0%
is where they came from that's where you
 
05:27:31.390 --> 05:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
need the inspection
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
puppy dogs are notorious for having
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
health and behavioral problems which can
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
result in huge Veterinary bills as well
 
05:27:39.390 --> 05:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
as emotional trauma the joy of bringing
 
05:27:41.548 --> 05:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
home a new dog can quickly turn to a
 
05:27:44.548 --> 05:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
panic trip to the emergency vet or even
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
the Heartbreak of a dog
 
05:27:49.708 --> 05:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
dying um the a postcard that I passed
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
around is about a Dog Named Gus who died
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
at the Puppy Palace um before the people
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
who were going to buy him could take him
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
home uh they had put down a deposit on
 
05:28:02.430 --> 05:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
on him they were getting all sorts of
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
excuses he's not ready he's not ready he
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be treated for this he needs to
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
be treated for that and then finally she
 
05:28:11.350 --> 05:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
got a call the woman who her name was
 
05:28:13.510 --> 05:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
Holly and she this was just too painful
 
05:28:15.310 --> 05:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
for her to to come talk about it because
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
she's put it behind her she called the
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
store um they said you can't see the dog
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
she's sleeping he's sleeping he's on
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
antibiotics and the next day the manager
 
05:28:25.948 --> 05:28:25.958 align:start position:0%
called and said that the dog had passed
 
05:28:28.990 --> 05:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
away in the night in the store all alone
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
and she had a little son who who was
 
05:28:32.270 --> 05:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
eight who just she said she'd never seen
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
him cry so hard so this is that's
 
05:28:37.390 --> 05:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
emotion but that matters you know this
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
is this is real trauma for people who
 
05:28:41.788 --> 05:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
live in New
 
05:28:45.788 --> 05:28:45.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my mouth is dry um also I want
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
to say that most people in New Hampshire
 
05:28:49.948 --> 05:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
hate puppy mills um if you look on the
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
cover sheet of the My Testimony you'll
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
see my group of friends and we spend a
 
05:28:59.548 --> 05:28:59.558 align:start position:0%
lot of our Saturdays out trying to warn
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
people not to buy a dog in a pet store
 
05:29:04.990 --> 05:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be sick um and
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be lied to and um I
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
have a petition here with 300 signatures
 
05:29:13.628 --> 05:29:13.638 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire residents saying that
 
05:29:15.150 --> 05:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're opposed to selling dogs
 
05:29:15.160 --> 05:29:17.150 align:start position:0%
they're they're opposed to selling dogs
in

05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
stores this bill will affect only six
 
05:29:20.080 --> 05:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
stores this bill will affect only six
retail

05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
stores including a store that's owned by
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts millionaire who lives in
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
a town that passed an ordinance against
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
the sale of dogs and cats in stores keep
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
that in mind that's one of these six
 
05:29:37.150 --> 05:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
stores and as written the bill will have
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
no effect on New Hampshire dog and cat
 
05:29:41.230 --> 05:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
breeders to sell their animals direct to
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
customers we need those people that's
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
where people go when they get lied to at
 
05:29:47.470 --> 05:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
the store I've talked to them they say
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
you know they said it wasn't from a
 
05:29:50.350 --> 05:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
puppy meal I found out it was so I went
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
to a local breeder we got a great dog
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're thrilled that's where they go um
 
05:29:56.310 --> 05:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
it won't affect the Department of
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
Agriculture their workload should remain
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
unchanged um and in terms of keeping
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
track of ownership I'll do that I'll go
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
out and make sure I'll see if if store
 
05:30:07.788 --> 05:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
changes hands I'll be sure to tell them
 
05:30:09.868 --> 05:30:09.878 align:start position:0%
and then the state vetenarian same
 
05:30:11.548 --> 05:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
scenario his workload should be
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
unchanged because the bill essentially
 
05:30:18.030 --> 05:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
caps things and maintains the status quo
 
05:30:19.510 --> 05:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
so ideally our state would have no
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
retail pet stores selling dogs but this
 
05:30:24.590 --> 05:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill will at least stem the flow of
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
puppy mill dogs into the state and we'll
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
be doing our part to um protect dogs and
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
citizens thank you thank you any
 
05:30:36.510 --> 05:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
Penza wow we're gonna be snowed in yeah
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:48.798 --> 05:30:50.430 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:30:50.430 --> 05:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
so quick question I I thought this only
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
would affect one and you're saying on
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
your in your testimony here that it
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
affects six stores so where can you do
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know off the top of your head where
 
05:31:03.910 --> 05:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
those other stores are located
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um I do I do know
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
the six Stores um uh commissioner Jasper
 
05:31:10.990 --> 05:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the two in Hudson there is the
 
05:31:12.670 --> 05:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
Puppy Palace in Manchester there's
 
05:31:14.430 --> 05:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
Family Pet and Aquarium in
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
nashaa and there is a is that five I
 
05:31:19.990 --> 05:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
forget four or five there was a man who
 
05:31:23.548 --> 05:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
sells um golden retrievers um I think
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
he's got a retail space but he's not
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
like in a strip mall and there is a
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:35.628 --> 05:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
Lebanon quick I thought that this bill
 
05:31:37.708 --> 05:31:37.718 align:start position:0%
though would be for prohibiting it for
 
05:31:39.788 --> 05:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
any further ones that's right they they
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
will be affected in the fact that they
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
won't be able to sell more dogs than
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
they sold in the year prior to the
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislation becoming you know enacted
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
and they won't be able to sell their
 
05:31:54.190 --> 05:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
business to somebody who's not an
 
05:31:56.350 --> 05:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
immediate family member so they're the
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
only people
 
05:32:01.150 --> 05:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
affected okay thank you for your
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay um to call Representative
 
05:32:08.000 --> 05:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
questions okay um to call Representative
Ellen

05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
Ellen
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:32:19.390 --> 05:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
you again honorable members um I just
 
05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
had a few comments based on what I've
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
heard um watching the hearing and the
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
first thing is the idea of removing the
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
humanity we keep hearing oh feel good or
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know sad stories or whatever but it
 
05:32:35.628 --> 05:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
is our job to go back to that point to
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
do the right thing and so while I don't
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
I I believe in deciding things
 
05:32:42.350 --> 05:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
dispassionately in the fact that it
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be objective you shouldn't
 
05:32:48.030 --> 05:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
remove the idea that suffering is wrong
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
from your brains when you're making
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
those decisions so I don't I don't like
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
the idea that oh don't listen to the
 
05:32:55.708 --> 05:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
death and the misery and the suffering
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
no actually do because that's important
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
away um um so we heard that there's no
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that any of these things are
 
05:33:08.030 --> 05:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
happening but we we know that puppy
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
palace is it has had numerous numerous
 
05:33:13.750 --> 05:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
complaints um especially of dogs being
 
05:33:15.868 --> 05:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
sick and dying so that's evidence in of
 
05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
itself but also one particular person
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
was told that they would be able to
 
05:33:22.868 --> 05:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
return the puppy if they had allergies
 
05:33:24.430 --> 05:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
they had allergies wasn't able to return
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the puppy um but further and I really
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated the commissioner's um testim
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
Tony in a number of ways um he said that
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
he fined a couple of rescues steep fines
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
for um uh inhumane treatment and if
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
that's ostensibly the people who are
 
05:33:43.868 --> 05:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing for the animals
 
05:33:47.070 --> 05:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the rescues um how much more is the
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
for-profit motive driving people to do
 
05:33:53.070 --> 05:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
inhumane Behavior so that tells me that
 
05:33:55.150 --> 05:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
much as we've talked about repeatedly
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is an Enforcement issue and he
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
himself said that he didn't have the
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
resources to to enforce properly and I
 
05:34:03.150 --> 05:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
would say and I I dare speak for the
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner that he might want more
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
funding for his Department to do
 
05:34:09.310 --> 05:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I think the same thing
 
05:34:11.190 --> 05:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
is true of lmon laws because I think we
 
05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of situations where people
 
05:34:14.708 --> 05:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
just don't even complain about something
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
because they don't think that anything
 
05:34:18.430 --> 05:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
will be done but I think that the the
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
point here is not to allow a bad
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
activity to to remain legal because we
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
aren't funding the enforcement side the
 
05:34:28.590 --> 05:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
point here is to make sure that this is
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
properly enforced fored and I have not
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
heard from anyone either side of the
 
05:34:36.990 --> 05:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill that inhumane treatment like the
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
the conditions that exist in puppy mills
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
or commercial breeders commonly should
 
05:34:43.628 --> 05:34:43.638 align:start position:0%
be allowed to continue I have not heard
 
05:34:46.430 --> 05:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
that but I do agree so so I don't think
 
05:34:48.190 --> 05:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
the answer is to Simply kill the bill I
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
think the answer is along the lines of
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner said which is it
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be he didn't say these exact
 
05:34:56.030 --> 05:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
words but it needs to be more robust and
 
05:34:58.270 --> 05:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
that it needs to address specific
 
05:35:00.750 --> 05:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
conditions about where puppies and
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
from so the point of this bill as it is
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently written and again I would
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
support it being strengthened to that to
 
05:35:13.750 --> 05:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
that extent um is to reduce the de the
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
demand from puppy mills and I did hear
 
05:35:19.548 --> 05:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh someone say that there were not small
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
pet stores in the state aside from these
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
six that have been cited I know of
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
several most small pet stores single
 
05:35:29.470 --> 05:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
owner uh individual proprietor pet
 
05:35:32.670 --> 05:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
stores uh focus on Exotics uh there's
 
05:35:34.750 --> 05:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
one in Seabrook on Route One I won't say
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
the name because I don't know that they
 
05:35:38.948 --> 05:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
have engaged in any unethical behavior
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
um but I do know that they're quite
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
large and sell a broad broad broad broad
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
range of animals so I just wanted to
 
05:35:49.628 --> 05:35:49.638 align:start position:0%
kind of correct that so um with that I
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't imagine you have a bunch of
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
questions for me but I just wanted to
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
comment on those things thank you any
 
05:35:58.590 --> 05:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:36:01.150 --> 05:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
i' like to Now call
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
obber to speak to the
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
committee good
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon chair eron
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
members of the House environment and
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee my name is Stacy
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
obber I am the government relations
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
manager in New England for the American
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club we are a nonprofit that is
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
140 years old uh we are recognized and
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
trusted expert in K9 Health Training uh
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
responsible dog ownership and breeding
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to express akc's
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to how
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
1680 um we have more than 5,000 clubs
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
across the country and we have 13 that
 
05:36:47.548 --> 05:36:47.558 align:start position:0%
are here um in New Hampshire I think
 
05:36:49.230 --> 05:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's helpful maybe for me to just
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
summarize what exactly how 1680 would do
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
as introduced to the committee one it
 
05:36:57.628 --> 05:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
would establish a new definition of
 
05:37:00.990 --> 05:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
retail pet store that would include any
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
pet vendor who transfers more than 30 uh
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
puppies animals dogs excuse me just dogs
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
in a year um and has a facility this
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee actually uh four or five years
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
ago did significant work in removing the
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
legal distinction between breeders and
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
pet stores and having everyone licensed
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
as a pet vendor with that commercial uh
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
definition triggering for Trans transer
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
of more than 30 dogs but inevitably our
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
hobby breeders who are not transferring
 
05:37:40.270 --> 05:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
even more than 30 um May in fact have a
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
physical facility they may have a kennel
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
so our concern is that this definition
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
would in fact apply to um not only your
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
retail pet store that you think of but
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
also your breeders here in New Hampshire
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
so I understand from the bill sponsor uh
 
05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent and um I think
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
irrespective of that not being the tent
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
we the intent we still have additional
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
concerns um the second piece of the bill
 
05:38:08.190 --> 05:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
would to would be to cap anyone that
 
05:38:11.310 --> 05:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
falls in that new definition to the same
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
transferring the same level of animals
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
that they transferred the year
 
05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
before and then also to prevent any new
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
pet stores new retail pet stores um from
 
05:38:25.070 --> 05:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
setting up shop and basically allowing
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
them to only host adoption events at
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
their at their facility um one of our
 
05:38:34.390 --> 05:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
concerns and I do have written testimony
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
and I sent it via email because there
 
05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
are hot links in there to some of the
 
05:38:40.830 --> 05:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
data that I'm going to share with you is
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
that um what we know from a survey that
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
the American Veterinary Medical
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
Association did in
 
05:38:53.868 --> 05:38:53.878 align:start position:0%
2022 is that uh pet owners report that
 
05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
only about 25% report that they were
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
able to get a dog from a breeder and
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
what that means is Americans love their
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
dogs the demand for dogs is higher than
 
05:39:05.670 --> 05:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
the number of breeders that are out
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
there producing dogs and our concern in
 
05:39:12.030 --> 05:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
what we have seen is that where this
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
type of bill has passed for instance in
 
05:39:17.708 --> 05:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
California was the first state to um
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
implement it back in
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
2019 individuals who are unwilling to
 
05:39:25.628 --> 05:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
wait the two to three years that they
 
05:39:28.350 --> 05:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
may be on a list waiting for a local
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
breeder to have a puppy available to
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
them inevitably will go online to
 
05:39:37.548 --> 05:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
purchase a dog and I know you heard
 
05:39:39.868 --> 05:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier about how the United
 
05:39:42.990 --> 05:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
States the USDA requires a license in
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
the event someone is selling a pet sight
 
05:39:49.948 --> 05:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
unseen the issue is that when consumers
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
go online and are not able to go in
 
05:39:54.910 --> 05:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
person whether that's to a retail pet
 
05:39:58.868 --> 05:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
store or to a local breeder to um see
 
05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
the pet firsthand to ask who the
 
05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
veterinarian is to get a copy of the
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
health certificate when they go online I
 
05:40:09.070 --> 05:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you a report from
 
05:40:09.080 --> 05:40:10.468 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you a report from
December

05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
December
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
2022 by the Better Business Bureau that
 
05:40:14.670 --> 05:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
started started
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
tracking online pet scams back in
 
05:40:22.868 --> 05:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
2017 and during the pandemic what they
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
saw is that people were not able to go
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh locally or to a pet store to acquire
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
a pet and the numbers increased to
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
25% in 2020 and 26% in
 
05:40:41.788 --> 05:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
2026 of all scams tracked by the Better
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
Business Bureau were pet related that's
 
05:40:48.430 --> 05:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
pretty significant um so our concern is
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
that people that are unwilling to wait
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
or can't go in person will be forced to
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
go online and these are not individuals
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
that are licensed by the USDA selling
 
05:41:03.430 --> 05:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
pets sight unseen um I have a antidotal
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
story about a breeder that contacted me
 
05:41:10.990 --> 05:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
online there was a Larry's labs and they
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
were selling cute puppies they had a
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
picture of a map where her kennel was
 
05:41:17.750 --> 05:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
located they were accepting payment
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
through venmo or zel or some other
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
online source and they sent the puppy
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
purchaser to her kennel to pick up the
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
puppy and of course she was not Larry's
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
lab uh local police were notified Animal
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
Control is investigating her this went
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
on for about a year and a half despite
 
05:41:36.990 --> 05:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
trying to assist her with making a
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
report on you know to the Department of
 
05:41:42.670 --> 05:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
Justice around this fraud and um what I
 
05:41:44.430 --> 05:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
learned is that a lot of these scammers
 
05:41:47.150 --> 05:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
are foreign scammers so even if you end
 
05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
up successfully getting a puppy that
 
05:41:51.390 --> 05:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
maybe is sick um many people are getting
 
05:41:53.230 --> 05:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
scammed and their money just being taken
 
05:41:56.070 --> 05:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so I hope you will read that article
 
05:41:58.830 --> 05:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I wanted to say is the
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
question came up about whether or not or
 
05:42:02.708 --> 05:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
you heard a lot that these laws have
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
been passed in other states with and
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
everything's going well there um when
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
California implemented the law back in
 
05:42:14.430 --> 05:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
2019 at that juncture in addition to
 
05:42:16.270 --> 05:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
online scams and I didn't bring them
 
05:42:18.910 --> 05:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
with me but I have articles from from
 
05:42:20.430 --> 05:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
that time period of when it was
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
happening U there also was a puppy
 
05:42:24.548 --> 05:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
laundering scheme the attorney general
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
for Iowa filed a lawsuit where there are
 
05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
Bad actors out there as I'm describing
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
to you and they had set up a 501c3
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
called themselves a rescue
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
organization accepted donations as
 
05:42:40.350 --> 05:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
though they were a charitable
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
organization purchased puppies at
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
auction and then turned around and was
 
05:42:49.948 --> 05:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
selling them um online as rescues to
 
05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
folks in California uh I also am aware
 
05:42:55.150 --> 05:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
that there has been heavy litigation for
 
05:42:57.150 --> 05:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
instance in the state of Maryland in
 
05:42:59.310 --> 05:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
trying to implement the law that they
 
05:43:01.150 --> 05:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
passed there it's been going on for
 
05:43:03.788 --> 05:43:03.798 align:start position:0%
years um so those are some serious
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that the American Kennel Club
 
05:43:09.708 --> 05:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
has um our recommendation is that uh New
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focus on enforcing your
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
current law you have a framework in
 
05:43:17.230 --> 05:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that consumers have some
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
protections um to also do the education
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
so that consumers know where exactly um
 
05:43:26.830 --> 05:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
they can go and see what they're
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
purchasing in person they can ask for
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
the V V aran's name who was responsible
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
for the health of that animal um and get
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
a copy of the health certificate um I
 
05:43:38.190 --> 05:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
think you know I'm not dismissing that
 
05:43:41.468 --> 05:43:41.478 align:start position:0%
there may be unfortunately uh
 
05:43:43.628 --> 05:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
substandard careing conditions in other
 
05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
states um New Hampshire has done a lot
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
of work to ensure that all animals
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
deserve Humane care and conditions um
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
and I think it is incumbent on the other
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
states to take action to ensure that any
 
05:43:59.548 --> 05:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
substandard conditions there along with
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
the USDA the federal government to
 
05:44:04.110 --> 05:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that those animals are cared in a
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
Humane in a humane way thank you thank
 
05:44:09.430 --> 05:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:44:11.750 --> 05:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um thank
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I briefly uh
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
hopped on to the Better Business
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
bureau's website while you were chatting
 
05:44:20.350 --> 05:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
just and I was trying to figure out if
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
the this Matrix that you're showing here
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
is Germain to New Hampshire or if that's
 
05:44:28.708 --> 05:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
um across the United States because
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
there is a way to filter and I wasn't
 
05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
able to get it to work in any capacity
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
there is a way to filter you can even
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
track I think by even town for instance
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
which I haven't done in quite a while
 
05:44:41.230 --> 05:44:41.240 align:start position:0%

05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
the online scams um had gone up so
 
05:44:55.230 --> 05:44:55.240 align:start position:0%

but you can go on um Better Business
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau they do have that track and you

05:45:17.110 --> 05:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of actually buying

specific breeds of uh dogs in New
 
05:45:22.510 --> 05:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know I've been on the weight
 
05:45:24.910 --> 05:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
list for two years for a livestock
 
05:45:28.350 --> 05:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
Guardian dog actually so I've had for
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
people looking for a specific type of
 
05:45:33.150 --> 05:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
working dog New Hampshire is actually a
 
05:45:35.548 --> 05:45:35.558 align:start position:0%
challenging place to buy a dog could you
 
05:45:37.868 --> 05:45:37.878 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit yeah I'm
 
05:45:41.788 --> 05:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
happy to do that um AKC does a lot of
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
Education around um breeding healthy
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
happy litters of dogs uh we'd love to
 
05:45:51.708 --> 05:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
see more people get involved in the in
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
this particular passion and and hobby
 
05:45:55.360 --> 05:45:57.070 align:start position:0%
this particular passion and and hobby
um

05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there has been
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
longstanding culture of adopt don't shop
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
and that I think has had an impact on um
 
05:46:08.190 --> 05:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals who are worth
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
to put in the Blood Sweat and Tears and
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
what it takes to actually produce a
 
05:46:15.868 --> 05:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
healthy happy litter of puppies um here
 
05:46:17.548 --> 05:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
in New England we only have one
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
veterinary school over at tus veterinary
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
school and I'm proud to share with you
 
05:46:23.708 --> 05:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
that we had approached the dean to say
 
05:46:26.510 --> 05:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
we were even having difficulty accessing
 
05:46:29.788 --> 05:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
um K9 reproductive veterinarians in the
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
area uh to work with breeders and we've
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh established a program of an elective
 
05:46:38.750 --> 05:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
where the veterinary students are
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
spending a semester with our AKC breeder
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
mentors on how to produce a healthy
 
05:46:45.468 --> 05:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
litter of pups again to try and do that
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
education and engage people in what it
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
takes to produce a healthy uh purebred
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
dog that's bed breed for a particular
 
05:46:56.590 --> 05:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
purpose um so thanks for the question um
 
05:46:58.910 --> 05:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
yes there's a there is a shortage it's
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
not a matter of just saying well if you
 
05:47:04.030 --> 05:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
shut down the pet stores they'll be a
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
bigger market for breeders um and
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
they'll make up the difference that's
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's I don't think that's an accurate
 
05:47:13.948 --> 05:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
reflection of what the consequence of
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire working for clients
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
taking care of their puppies I started
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
to notice sick puppies coming from a
 
05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
store in Portsmith New Hampshire I
 
05:48:10.830 --> 05:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
started to investigate why this was
 
05:48:13.110 --> 05:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
happening I accumulated at the time by
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
the right to no law V certificates

these pups were coming from and found a
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%

vote on this bill it is our right to be
 
05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
heard throughout the House of
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives currently while waiting
 
05:49:43.390 --> 05:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
for the bill to bring this bill to
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns have been doing their
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
own grassroot Banning of retail uh store
 
05:49:49.230 --> 05:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
sales of puppies and kittens in the
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
state and Kurt arberg has the director
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has a total of this
 
05:49:56.270 --> 05:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
record what I know is every town so far
 
05:49:57.548 --> 05:49:57.558 align:start position:0%
that has put the Warren article
 
05:49:59.670 --> 05:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
resolution on their B it
 
05:50:02.708 --> 05:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
passes people don't want these stores in
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
their town or city what I know for the
 
05:50:07.628 --> 05:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
past eight years from my experience
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
firsthand fact puppy sold at any pet
 
05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
store is a m dog just because they are
 
05:50:15.868 --> 05:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
registered by the AKC does not guarantee
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
they from a responsible breeder as it
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
would never ever sell to a retail store
 
05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
I'm confused as the AKC lobbies for
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
retail sales in Pet Shops yet on AKC
 
05:50:28.030 --> 05:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
Marketplace website I don't see them
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
advertis iing the stor is in any state
 
05:50:31.948 --> 05:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
instead they advertise responsible
 
05:50:33.868 --> 05:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
breeders I have no problem with
 
05:50:36.190 --> 05:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
responsible breeders we we need great
 
05:50:38.430 --> 05:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
breeders on the website I connected with
 
05:50:40.750 --> 05:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
a breeder from Manchester New Hampshire
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
and asked if she sold her pups to the
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
Puppy Palace in Manchester she told me
 
05:50:47.070 --> 05:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
she is a merit breeder and she would be
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to me about her breed but
 
05:50:51.390 --> 05:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
stay away from the store regarding mpups
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
a pet scam we're talking we just were
 
05:50:57.150 --> 05:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
talking about online this is that's a
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
different Bill to be talked about that's
 
05:51:01.230 --> 05:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
not what we're talking about here fact
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
is puppies in Pet Shops are are not
 
05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
always a careful thought it is an
 
05:51:07.750 --> 05:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
emotional buy and the pet store knows
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
this and they have the financing for
 
05:51:11.788 --> 05:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
them to keep their product moving as a
 
05:51:13.830 --> 05:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
pet care person I have adopted two dogs
 
05:51:16.110 --> 05:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
from clients that were emotional buys
 
05:51:17.868 --> 05:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
and they had health issues their entire
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
life fact puppy mills operate for a
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
profit with no concern about the health
 
05:51:24.110 --> 05:51:24.120 align:start position:0%

05:53:18.510 --> 05:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
make sense to me as responsible breeders

states the fact and milp breeders don't
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
care where they send their puppies and
 
05:53:32.350 --> 05:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
they're out for the money what I know is
 
05:53:34.510 --> 05:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want the state of New Hampshire
 
05:53:37.310 --> 05:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
to become a Dumping Ground a Dumping

left because I have 20 years left in me
 
05:54:03.628 --> 05:54:03.638 align:start position:0%

battle I I want him to sign the bill I
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%

ownership we do oppose hb680
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
um before I get into changing the topic
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
up a little bit from what we've been
 
05:55:53.110 --> 05:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
hearing I just did want to mention that
 
05:55:55.110 --> 05:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
as part of my research for this bill I
 
05:55:56.868 --> 05:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
did speak with various New Hampshire
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and there was more concern
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
with the health of rescue dogs in
 
05:56:04.590 --> 05:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
comparison to those seen from pet stores
 
05:56:06.468 --> 05:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh animals delivered to pet stores in
 
05:56:08.430 --> 05:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are already highly
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
regulated so any that are being imported
 
05:56:13.628 --> 05:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
into the state that includes uh in the
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
state of their birth they're receiving a
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
health certificate in the state of their
 
05:56:19.548 --> 05:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
distributor if they aren't coming here
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
directly from the straight of their
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
state of their birth by the federal
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
government if they're USDA licensed and
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire when animals enter the
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
state um and we have animal cruelty or
 
05:56:34.310 --> 05:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty is a criminal offense
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere so we have do have rules on
 
05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
the books um if anything wasn't to be
 
05:56:42.830 --> 05:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
following those outlined for health
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
certificates if there is sick puppies
 
05:56:47.230 --> 05:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
being sold it is imperative that the
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
Vets providing the health certificates
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
are questioned and held accountable
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
under 437 col 8 the vet signing a health
 
05:56:57.150 --> 05:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
certificate is the one responsible for
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
stores or breeders selling Sick Puppies
 
05:57:02.590 --> 05:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
or cats um so we need to go back to the
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
basics and understand how these Health
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
certificates are being given for sick
 
05:57:10.830 --> 05:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
animals we have quarantine requirements
 
05:57:12.910 --> 05:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
of 48 hours for animals that are coming
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
into the state that is to make sure that
 
05:57:17.910 --> 05:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
they do have a period of incubation
 
05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
should they be coming with any diseases
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
while they're being transported to our
 
05:57:25.868 --> 05:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
state after that period they would be
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
seen by a New Hampshire veterinarian who
 
05:57:30.430 --> 05:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
would be Pro providing the health
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
certificate um representing the health
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
of that puppy Okay moving on additional
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh concerns that we have that we're
 
05:57:41.708 --> 05:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill for are conflicts
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire antitrust law and
 
05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
you'll see uh highlighted in yellow the
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
facts regarding the antitrust law it's
 
05:57:53.628 --> 05:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
code section 356 colon1 under
 
05:57:56.070 --> 05:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
prohibitive acts and it outlines that
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
every contract combination or conspiracy
 
05:58:00.670 --> 05:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
and Restraint of
 
05:58:03.708 --> 05:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
trade and this um is for the purpose of
 
05:58:06.270 --> 05:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
fixing controlling maintaining limiting
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
or discontinuing the production
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer mining sale or distribution
 
05:58:15.548 --> 05:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
of any commodity or service so by this
 
05:58:18.150 --> 05:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
bill coming in and telling a business
 
05:58:21.230 --> 05:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
what they can or cannot sell we are
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about how that affects the New
 
05:58:26.430 --> 05:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire antitrust law we feel that
 
05:58:29.070 --> 05:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
this is a restrictive business model or
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
restricts business models I should say
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
um it forces pet stores into a
 
05:58:37.990 --> 05:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive business model we also feel
 
05:58:40.110 --> 05:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
that there is potential taking without
 
05:58:41.708 --> 05:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
just compens
 
05:58:44.670 --> 05:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
compensation and when you look at the
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
section that talks
 
05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
about um businesses not being able to
 
05:58:53.468 --> 05:58:53.478 align:start position:0%
sell their business if someone's going
 
05:58:55.590 --> 05:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
into business it is to try and build
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
something and you don't want it to die
 
05:59:00.670 --> 05:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
when you die so you do want to be able
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
to sell your business and you've
 
05:59:04.590 --> 05:59:04.600 align:start position:0%
established something that is worth
 
05:59:07.830 --> 05:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
money um is it just selling cats or dogs
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's likely all of the accessories
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
there's so much more beyond the section
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the store that is including the sale
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
of cats and dogs but you want to be able
 
05:59:19.270 --> 05:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
to sell that business get a return on
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
your investment um so without the
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
ability to do that except for within
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
family um that doesn't seem like a very
 
05:59:30.430 --> 05:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
Pro bus type of restriction to have in
 
05:59:33.788 --> 05:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
the law also um not being able to
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
relocate your business is quite an odd
 
05:59:40.110 --> 05:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
one that's in here um so you aren't
 
05:59:43.868 --> 05:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to transfer from one store to
 
05:59:46.990 --> 05:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
another or location um if this bill was
 
05:59:49.390 --> 05:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
to impact everyone that it could impact
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't just be pet stores but
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody may not be able to sell their
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
home um because it had a kennel on it
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
for somebody else who was going to take
 
06:00:00.070 --> 06:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
it over as a kennel property where they
 
06:00:02.270 --> 06:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
may be selling puppies or kittens for
 
06:00:04.468 --> 06:00:04.478 align:start position:0%
example uh in addition to just being
 
06:00:07.990 --> 06:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
able to relocate your business to get
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades so we always talk about how we
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
want all of these breeders pet stores
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know anybody that has animals for
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
sale to have improved environments for
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
the animals that may require relocating
 
06:00:25.788 --> 06:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
to a different facility where you can
 
06:00:28.430 --> 06:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
have bigger enclosures for the animals
 
06:00:30.910 --> 06:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
or you have better duct work for air
 
06:00:33.230 --> 06:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
ventilation um things like that or you
 
06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
may be able to upgrade the quantity of
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
washers and dryers that you have to keep
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
everything nice and clean so you would
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually be restricting them from being
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
able to make those type of
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
improvements um obviously we've heard a
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
lot about the increased Reliance on
 
06:00:53.868 --> 06:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
rescues and outof state Brokers so we do
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
feel that this bill actually promotes
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
shelters and rescues purchas from
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
commercial entities which contradicts
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
its intent you've heard talk about um
 
06:01:09.270 --> 06:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
rescues getting dogs from auctions um
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
the commercial kennels that we're
 
06:01:14.590 --> 06:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
talking about across the country they
 
06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
may relinquish animals to rescues um for
 
06:01:22.110 --> 06:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
resale when they're no longer using them
 
06:01:23.948 --> 06:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
for breeding or if they've been unable
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
to sell them so I just want everyone to
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
know that rest reses are obtaining
 
06:01:31.868 --> 06:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
animals from the exact places that this
 
06:01:36.628 --> 06:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to supposedly stop
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
um we also feel that it gives rescues a
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
monopoly by limiting local options for
 
06:01:44.468 --> 06:01:44.478 align:start position:0%
obtaining pets and forcing individuals
 
06:01:49.230 --> 06:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
to resort to sight unseen online Brokers
 
06:01:51.548 --> 06:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state or working with
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
breeders who haven't necessarily met the
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
pet vendor threshold this raises
 
06:01:58.590 --> 06:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about increased demand for
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
rescues potential scams and disease
 
06:02:06.708 --> 06:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
risks um we feel this bill is only going
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
to increase imported rescue animals and
 
06:02:13.708 --> 06:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
um disease such as the canine respitory
 
06:02:15.468 --> 06:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
illness that we've seen running rampant
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we've also seen parvo
 
06:02:20.350 --> 06:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
and distemper cases increasing parasite
 
06:02:20.360 --> 06:02:21.310 align:start position:0%
and distemper cases increasing parasite
cases

06:02:21.310 --> 06:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
cases
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
increasing um including parasitic
 
06:02:26.590 --> 06:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
immunity to standard treatments and
 
06:02:28.270 --> 06:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
these are not due due to purebred dog
 
06:02:29.948 --> 06:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
and cat sales but we feel that they're
 
06:02:32.270 --> 06:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
due to rescues who ignore the laws for
 
06:02:35.150 --> 06:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
importation into New
 
06:02:38.468 --> 06:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um see I think I had one more
 
06:02:40.750 --> 06:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
piece here oh I did want to mention
 
06:02:43.468 --> 06:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
consumer choice is being taken away and
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
accessibility for the consumers who may
 
06:02:48.990 --> 06:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
purchase a dog or cat from a pet store
 
06:02:51.310 --> 06:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
and it's important for those who don't
 
06:02:55.030 --> 06:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
have access to breeders or rescue um we
 
06:02:57.030 --> 06:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
heard about what the weight list can be
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
like for getting some getting a puppy
 
06:03:03.468 --> 06:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
from a breeder myself I breed doberman's
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
um my weight list is two years out so
 
06:03:08.110 --> 06:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
that matches you know what we've heard
 
06:03:11.830 --> 06:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
earlier and people don't want to wait
 
06:03:14.190 --> 06:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
that long I love my people who are
 
06:03:16.430 --> 06:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
willing to take the time and wait and
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
have that rapport with me over that
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
waiting period um but not everybody is
 
06:03:24.150 --> 06:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that and that
 
06:03:26.468 --> 06:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily a bad thing for them
 
06:03:29.510 --> 06:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the time is now it's
 
06:03:32.430 --> 06:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
maybe summer vacation you have three
 
06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
months with your kids and the dog to be
 
06:03:37.150 --> 06:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
at home get it potty trained before
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
everyone goes back to school you go back
 
06:03:41.230 --> 06:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
to work whatever it might be so there
 
06:03:44.110 --> 06:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
are reasons when waiting isn't always
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to be the best option for
 
06:03:48.430 --> 06:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
everybody we also can't expect that
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be satisfied or
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
with a rescue dog or have that dog be
 
06:03:57.468 --> 06:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them you are limited on
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
Choice size temperament you don't know
 
06:04:02.910 --> 06:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
the health or background of that dog
 
06:04:05.590 --> 06:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
similarly to a puppy that might be
 
06:04:07.948 --> 06:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
coming into a pet store it may only have
 
06:04:09.788 --> 06:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
been in New Hampshire for two-day
 
06:04:11.868 --> 06:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
quarantine period sitting in the rescue
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
for a week and off it is into its new
 
06:04:17.230 --> 06:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
home so it is really no different in
 
06:04:20.430 --> 06:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
that aspect um but we are bringing in
 
06:04:22.468 --> 06:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
potential disease every time we import a
 
06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
dog and with the older dogs we really
 
06:04:26.868 --> 06:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
aren't sure about temperament and I
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
think we hear a lot about that um so we
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
also feel this bill is unnecessary as
 
06:04:34.750 --> 06:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
there are a low number of pet stores
 
06:04:36.750 --> 06:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
selling dogs and cats in New Hampshire I
 
06:04:38.788 --> 06:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
think we heard the number is five maybe
 
06:04:41.230 --> 06:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's a six one we're not sure and we
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
have uh concerns about you know the
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
rescue dogs compared to those from the
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
pet stores after speaking with the local
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and the existing
 
06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
regulations and criminal offenses
 
06:04:54.270 --> 06:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
related to animal cruelty as well as
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
consumer protections should be deemed
 
06:04:56.638 --> 06:04:57.788 align:start position:0%
consumer protections should be deemed
sufficient

06:04:57.788 --> 06:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
06:04:59.910 --> 06:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we would urge you to vote this bill
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
itl if further discussions do happen
 
06:05:05.708 --> 06:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
about Alternatives with this bill here I
 
06:05:08.430 --> 06:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
would greatly appreciate uh opening the
 
06:05:11.948 --> 06:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
floor with you all to discuss those
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
potentials I'll take any questions thank
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:05:19.390 --> 06:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
Bixby based on your testimony please put
 
06:05:22.230 --> 06:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
on your mic Bas on your testimony and
 
06:05:24.468 --> 06:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the commissioner there
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
are um potential issues with the
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
sourcing of rescue dogs based on other
 
06:05:32.830 --> 06:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like there are
 
06:05:35.070 --> 06:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
potential issues and and and health
 
06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
issues with dogs at pet stores uh do you
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
think it might make sense to uh send
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to interim study in order to
 
06:05:48.990 --> 06:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
get a broader sort of um uh solution
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the commissioner was suggesting
 
06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of finding characteristics of
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
dogs coming into the state that would
 
06:05:59.868 --> 06:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
allow us to limit the ones that are not
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that shouldn't be coming into the
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
state uh thank you for the question um I
 
06:06:08.350 --> 06:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
do think that that is a a consideration
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
I feel like we're starting with
 
06:06:13.948 --> 06:06:13.958 align:start position:0%

everyone thank you for the opportunity
 
06:07:42.190 --> 06:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
to speak with you all today on House
 
06:07:46.430 --> 06:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 1680 my name is Taylor lelli and I
 
06:07:49.468 --> 06:07:49.478 align:start position:0%
am here on behalf of the pet advocacy
 
06:07:51.948 --> 06:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
Network you all should have testimony
 
06:07:54.270 --> 06:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
from me that was handed out
 
06:07:56.910 --> 06:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
previously um the pet advocacy Network
 
06:07:59.868 --> 06:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
is the largest pet trade Association in
 
06:08:02.708 --> 06:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
the nation we represent members
 
06:08:05.708 --> 06:08:05.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the country but also in New
 
06:08:09.868 --> 06:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I am here on behalf of the
 
06:08:12.990 --> 06:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
pet advocacy Network to ask you to vote
 
06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
no to House Bill
 
06:08:18.030 --> 06:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
1680 we know that pet stores are the
 
06:08:20.350 --> 06:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
most highly regulated and transparent
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
source for consumers to obtain an animal
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and we have seen these
 
06:08:27.868 --> 06:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
pet sale bands plague the nation
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in places like California
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's been brought up today where
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarians reported a large increase
 
06:08:37.868 --> 06:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
in sick animals two years after that pet
 
06:08:40.990 --> 06:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
sale ban was enacted and puppy scams
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
increased by
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
350% according to the Better Business
 
06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau um I know we talked a lot about
 
06:08:52.030 --> 06:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
people going online as a source to get
 
06:08:54.788 --> 06:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
their dogs I do want to correct and make
 
06:08:58.190 --> 06:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
known that the USDA regulating online
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
pet sales is minimal at best um it's
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
mostly complaint-based when they're
 
06:09:07.708 --> 06:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
searching for unlicensed vendors so
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's not something that they have a
 
06:09:11.030 --> 06:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
division that they're looking actively
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
for at this
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
time um
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
additionally I think that it is
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
important to note that there are Bad
 
06:09:21.468 --> 06:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
actors in The Pet Care Community we are
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
not here to dispute that we just believe
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot better ways to address
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that than pet sale bans if that's
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
something that you choose to do again
 
06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
that could be with things like sourcing
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions or Banning roadside sale of
 
06:09:37.548 --> 06:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
puppies but I do think it's also
 
06:09:39.548 --> 06:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
important to note that pet stores are
 
06:09:41.788 --> 06:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
already regulated in New Hampshire
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard numerous ways of how um I
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
will reiterate again that they are
 
06:09:50.750 --> 06:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
required to provide a 14-day warranty
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide that Veterinary Care certificate
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
they can't sell puppies and kittens
 
06:09:57.150 --> 06:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
under 8 weeks of age
 
06:10:00.750 --> 06:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
they must be licensed clean and sanitary
 
06:10:03.510 --> 06:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
facilities we do at the pet advocacy
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
Network think it's very important to
 
06:10:09.390 --> 06:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
protect pet Choice there are families
 
06:10:11.548 --> 06:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
that cannot get a dog from a shelter
 
06:10:12.948 --> 06:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
because they may have something like
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
allergies and they or they just want to
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
know their animals full medical history
 
06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
which is something that a pet store can
 
06:10:19.520 --> 06:10:20.590 align:start position:0%
which is something that a pet store can
offer

06:10:20.590 --> 06:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
offer
 
06:10:24.030 --> 06:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
them um we know that also I had provided
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
in my testimony the numerous ways that
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
the pet industry helps boost and protect
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the economy in New Hampshire so to enact
 
06:10:34.030 --> 06:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
this ban would be an attack on the small
 
06:10:37.510 --> 06:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that do this now we do
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
welcome collaboration with you all if
 
06:10:43.110 --> 06:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
you choose to consider other legislation
 
06:10:44.590 --> 06:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
we'd love to be a part of those
 
06:10:46.910 --> 06:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
conversations we've done so in other
 
06:10:50.390 --> 06:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
states um but we do think that we would
 
06:10:53.708 --> 06:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
love if you voted no to House Bill 1680
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
because this is not going to result in
 
06:10:59.830 --> 06:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
the elimination of pppy Mills thank you
 
06:11:01.628 --> 06:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative NAB thank you
 
06:11:07.150 --> 06:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
madam share um so we heard earlier that
 
06:11:09.150 --> 06:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
it is pretty easy to look online and see
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
where a pet store is getting its pets
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
from and it sounds like you would
 
06:11:17.070 --> 06:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
support legislation that would ensure
 
06:11:18.910 --> 06:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
that where the dogs are coming from into
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
a pet store is a licensed reader yes
 
06:11:24.150 --> 06:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
USDA license and there are states that
 
06:11:26.708 --> 06:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
do that already um Arizona has some some
 
06:11:29.030 --> 06:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
great examples again if that's something
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
you guys choose to pursue we're happy to
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
work with you on that um there is an
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to go about that but we
 
06:11:37.628 --> 06:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that everyone's a
 
06:11:39.750 --> 06:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
part of that conversation all right
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
