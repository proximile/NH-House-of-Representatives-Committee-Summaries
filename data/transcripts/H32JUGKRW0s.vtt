00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
the hour being 10 o'clock I'll open the
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
public works and highways subcommittee
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
on lapse extensions and with with your
 
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
Indulgence I'll take one minute to
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
explain what the purpose of the
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is if you look in the back
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
of house bill 25 there's several pages
 
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
of what we call lapse extensions any
 
00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
amount that's not listed there that was
 
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate on a prior budget would
 
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
lapse on June 30th of this year unless
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's extended and that could put an
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
agency in a position where they can't
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
pay a bill on a contract they've already
 
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 align:start position:0%
awarded conversely if there is
 
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are lapsing we can
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
see if there is a usable amount of
 
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
funding remaining in that line and apply
 
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
it to some other project that we would
 
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
like to fund in this budget our first
 
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
agency is the Department of
 
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
administrative services and commissioner
 
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus is here in Karen montamaki
 
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
who's the director of plant and properly
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
management and having said what I want
 
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
to say uh
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the floor is yours um
 
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us um Karen's going
 
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
to talk for almost the entire time which
 
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
is great for me
 
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
um about uh our lapses and as you know
 
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
we have a ton of projects uh most of
 
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
which are still in process of
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
construction but I think she has a good
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
summary of where we are and then I'll I
 
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
can answer questions about the IT
 
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 align:start position:0%
project she can answer the ones about
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
all the other ones
 
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
great good morning
 
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so I'll start off by kind of going
 
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
over in general the entire list I won't
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
spend time on each individual
 
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation and feel free to you know
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
ask questions
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
um so the first big chunk of projects
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
are fiscal projects that were approved
 
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21 and essentially all of
 
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
those are either ongoing or awaiting
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
um to be started and the reason is
 
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 align:start position:0%
there's just a huge lag right now with
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
acquiring equipment so delays on getting
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
equipment and also you know there's a
 
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get contracts so we we put
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
things out to bid and we're either
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
getting no bids or one bid and so some
 
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 align:start position:0%
things are going out multiple times so
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
essentially all of the fiscal 21
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
projects we're asking to be extended
 
00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.009 align:start position:0%
projects we're asking to be extended
um

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
then kind of moving on there's a few
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
projects where there's
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know 20 or less remaining and those
 
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
we've indicated that those should lapse
 
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
those are projects that were completed
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's one here with a dollar left
 
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
um so again I'm not going to spend a lot
 
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
of time on those and you're not you're
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
not going to see a whole lot of money
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
coming back on those either
 
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
um but then kind of moving moving
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
through the list one project that I
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about a little bit was
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
from 2015
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it was an appropriation for a burger
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh burglar alarm system
 
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
um which there's a hundred and seventy
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars left in that project
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
um we are that was not one that we had
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
indicated to lapse earlier
 
00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.530 align:start position:0%
indicated to lapse earlier
um

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
but we're thinking that that we might
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
want to offer that one as a lapse
 
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
because it's a project that we're we're
 
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
not going to continue on with or go any
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
further with at this time
 
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.070 align:start position:0%
further with at this time
um

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
again there's a lot of projects uh
 
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
starting with the fiscal 17 projects
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
that are still in process they're kind
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
of awaiting final payments or getting
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
completed so we're asking for those to
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
be extended the next project from fiscal
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
17 and again I do need me to cite the
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
the number would that be helpful or
 
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
well the the one you mentioned about the
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
my list has the sorry I'm looking at the
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the law number is what I have on mine
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
so it's not matching up with what you
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
have on your list
 
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.629 align:start position:0%
have on your list
um

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
from 17 there's a State Library roof
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
project that again has 58
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
165 dollars in it that is another one
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
that we had originally not indicated to
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
lapse but that's one that is complete
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
and we're we're able to lapse that fifty
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think that's why we have State Library
 
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 align:start position:0%
parapet and ceiling repair
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we're going to elapse
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
and then there were a few smaller lapses
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
that I had already indicated
 
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
um that we would be lapsing those and
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
I'll just point those out
 
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
um if we're keeping track of dollars
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
here so the next one would be from 2017
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay and there's 3 700 left in that
 
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.469 align:start position:0%
okay and there's 3 700 left in that
project

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's a a thousand one
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
thousand twenty two dollars left in the
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
Bancroft building stabilization project
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
what would it be if I go through the
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
ones I think you're elapsing and you
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
tell me if you agree with them that
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be great starting with the oldest
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
one it's main building Bakery from 2009
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
yes with one dollar left okay and
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
then you said 51 the burglar alarm with
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
how much remaining
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
I have 170 450.
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds like a good chunk and
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
then the one above that uh state-owned
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
that one would not lapse
 
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:50.029 align:start position:0%
that one would not lapse
well

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
now is that 98 533 uh so that's 15 A1
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
state-owned facilities emergency repairs
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
is not in the list oh it's not in the
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
list you're right okay so that should
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
lapse that should lapse all right the
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
one above that is Erp scheduling and
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
20 uh that one would like it has 19 508
 
00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:16.909 align:start position:0%
20 uh that one would like it has 19 508
left

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
and then 17 C2 main building North End
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
Ada access
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
yes 3700 okay and then uh from 17 B10
 
00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:43.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
and then the one you mentioned uh B9
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
State Library parapet and ceiling repair
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
yes we are adding that the one above
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is B5 Health and Human Services
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
yes that's there's no funds remaining in
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
that so that would last and then uh 17b1
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
doit new computer fire room uh new
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
computer room fire system
 
00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:26.779 align:start position:0%
that is complete as well okay and then
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh from 19 uh
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
section 14 bankrupt building
 
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.130 align:start position:0%
section 14 bankrupt building
stabilization

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
correct with one thousand twenty two
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
dollars and then
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
that one's also not on our list I think
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's a boiler project that came off
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
because it's completed and then 19d2
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes no funds remaining in that okay and
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
19 C5 paint and carpentry electrical
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
service and entrance yes and that has 17
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
218 dollars so that would lapse and then
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
19 B7 temporary boiler
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is history here temporary
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
boiler infrastructure removal yes
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
yeah 163 and then the Walker building
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
HVAC which is 19 B1 yes and that has no
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay those are the ones that I had that
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
are not mentioned in this budget
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
that were either appropriated or uh
 
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes and that matches up with my list
 
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.710 align:start position:0%
yes and that matches up with my list
okay

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
and if you could send your list to uh Mr
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
Shea like we did last time so he can
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
cross check it with his and we can total
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
up the amount of funds that we have
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
so out of all of that we're going to
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh from from this year's House Bill 25
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to delete 46 and 51. correct
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
okay and so you have 50 minutes to say
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
whatever you would like to see
 
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
so I did a lot whenever Mr chairman
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
get a copy of this list because you're
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
working off of a list that is not
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
available to me and I can't I don't know
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the rest of my colleagues here have
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
access to the same list and respectfully
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm Flying Blind with the
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
last five minutes of testimony between
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
yourself and uh administrative services
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
well uh I'm I'm not opposed to giving
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
you that I don't have extra copies with
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
me this is something that I made over
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
the weekend that I've never done before
 
00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:48.650 align:start position:0%
the weekend that I've never done before
actually

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
most of the time we rely on the agency
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
to know this
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh but this time I'm able to cross check
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll send this out
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
I'll send the whole committee the whole
 
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um if you want a list of uh
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
our list of projects based on what is
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
and isn't lapsing
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
so that you have that as well as opposed
 
00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
so that you have that as well as opposed
to

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
uh would it be possible to ask that if
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
that list of what Eve's working on gets
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
cross reference to the lapse extension
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
worksheet so by number so we could
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
quickly go down by the number to
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
understand which
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
item that it is
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is similar to ours because
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
they have the 21s and all the 19s
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
so I'll just briefly say that with the
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
projects other than the few dollars the
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
ones that had a few dollars in it it's
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
about 250 000 give or take
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and then commissioner arlinghaus do
 
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
you want to speak on any of the other IT
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
projects the the IT projects are are
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
mostly the institutional
 
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.490 align:start position:0%
mostly the institutional
um

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh the Erp advancement and that's money
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
that we're using for the cloud project
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
that recently there's a an additional 15
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
million in arpa funds for fiscal that is
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
on top of um both of those two
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
um those two requests as well
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
so the the IT projects are all being
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
used for the for the new Cloud
 
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
used for the for the new Cloud
implementation

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
so we would appreciate it if they did
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
not lapse
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
the one of them from 2017 it only has
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand dollars left in it so
 
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
if you really wanted that you could have
 
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:02.569 align:start position:0%
if you really wanted that you could have
that

00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
normally we will consider a repurpose on
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
anything 10th out with a balance of 10
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
000 or more I think is what we've done
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the past so okay now 19 here and 19
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
there tends to add up if you have enough
 
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:17.339 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
We No it's it's uh frankly for the uh
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
I mean the proud the cloud project in
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
the end is going to cost between 22 and
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
24 million dollars so every 19 probably
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
I can explain the sheet if people want
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
to try to understand it and it um if
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
only because I didn't at first so
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the org code
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
description this is the this is how it's
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
sorted and you'll see
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
um l21 meaning it's from the lows of 21.
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
and then they're sorted within that
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
and obviously those are the ones that
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
Karen said on our lapsing after that it
 
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.660 align:start position:0%
reverts to
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
chronological order so the one project
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
from 09 with the dollar left in it that
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
we were happy to lapse the dollar
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
um is first and there's one left from 11
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
two left from 15. a handful from 17 and
 
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
then all of the 19s
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
did you want to talk about the Philbrook
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes we can talk brief
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
so I believe that came around as well
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
and everyone has a copy of the
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
informational item from last week's
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview meeting
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so really this came to us from Health
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and they had asked if
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
we could put in an item to
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
amend the agency
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
um who's in charge of the funding so it
 
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
was originally put in as a dis project
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
because when the capital budget was
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
submitted it was a building that we
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
owned or managed which was used for
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
office space and has since been
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
converted to a patient care facility
 
00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:22.459 align:start position:0%
which Das is no longer involved in
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining and caring for that building
 
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to ask that the capital
 
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.670 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to ask that the capital
appropriation

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
um which was from 2021 item seven yep be
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
reassigned to Health and Human Services
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:45.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
um just a couple other items I guess so
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.990 align:start position:0%
one thing
um

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
if this is the appropriate place to
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
bring it up is um we have money
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated for a roof project
 
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.150 align:start position:0%
appropriated for a roof project
um

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.470 align:start position:0%
um
for

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
Paisley annexed at the main building
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's a 2017 project
 
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
it's a 2017 project
um

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we're no longer planning on
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
repairing or replacing that roof as that
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
piece of the main building is in such
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
disrepair that we're looking to
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
discontinue any use of that section but
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
we do have another area in Maine
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
building the North Pavilion that needs a
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
roof and so we were wondering if we
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
could possibly add language instead of
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
using it for the Paisley Annex portion
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
of main building to use it for the North
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the suggestion is item 48 should be
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
repurposed from Peasley Wing roof
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
replacement to North Pavilion
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
correct and we'll take that back to the
 
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.380 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
chances are we would do them but
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more drafting work so
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
but sure we want to use the money if
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's available happy to help with that
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you on the roof replacement that
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
you're not doing on the Paisley building
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
does that roof need a replacement you're
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
just not going to do it now or it's not
 
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.930 align:start position:0%
just not going to do it now or it's not
critical

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
honestly if it was possible we would
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
probably take down that piece of the
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
main building it's in it's an older area
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
with very thick cinder block walls that
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
was kind of used as a detention cells in
 
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
the past and it's really not usable as
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
office space because of that and so it's
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
been used as storage but would require
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
major major steel reinforcement and in
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
order to reuse it for anything and it's
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
just Cost prohibitive to restore it for
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
what we would end up with so we're we're
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
it would be our choice to not put the
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
roof on if that at all yeah just
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
following up it would also be your
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
choice to take the building down
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
eventually yeah that would be what we'd
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
like to do
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay is it is it a hazard of any or an
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
attractive nuisance the way it is right
 
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.750 align:start position:0%
attractive nuisance the way it is right
now

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's I would say no I mean but as you
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
probably know if if it continues to
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
remain in place over time it would
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
degrade further and then it might become
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions let
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
me just recap this so item seven we want
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
to amend
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh item
 
00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:05.059 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
46 we want to lapse so delete from House
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
Bill 25
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
same with 51 and 48 we want to repurpose
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
anything further anyone wants to say no
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for having us all right we're
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
always happy to have you your the
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
backbone of our construction Battalion
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
here uh we couldn't do it without the
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
people to find people in the in the
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Public Works
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
while we have time here I will go
 
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.970 align:start position:0%
while we have time here I will go
through

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh the agencies that responded by mail
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
that we have information from
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
on line 54 agriculture markets and food
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
would like to keep that one
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from the community colleges
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
in their full committee presentation
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
they want to add
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
an extension for in 2021
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
section 14
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
for critical maintenance
 
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:18.380 align:start position:0%
they want to add from 2019
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh letter B NCC engineering technology
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
renovation agency
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
and their item from 2017 a critical
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance and safety they want to
 
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.710 align:start position:0%
maintenance and safety they want to
lapse

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
directions is coming in
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
they are there and we have that in this
 
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.890 align:start position:0%
they are there and we have that in this
packet

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.100 align:start position:0%
they they have from 74 down to 77
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
they are prepared to delete item 77
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
the renovation of the Hudson CTE Center
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
that project is complete and from 17 uh
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to lapse pre-engineering
 
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
they're going to lapse pre-engineering
technology

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
the department of energy would like to
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
they that's also in this packet
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh wants to extend the fuel assistance
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
program that's 100 Federal Environmental
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
services will be in fish and game uh
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
spoke on this in their
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
full committee presentation
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
the powder the item number
 
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.770 align:start position:0%
the powder the item number
99

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:35.780 align:start position:0%
99
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
they would like to repurpose so they can
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
use it Statewide on any fish hatchery
 
00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:44.299 align:start position:0%
and we have that request
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
and from 17 Hatchery infrastructure
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
improvements will lapse
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
item number after item number 131 we
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
would add from 2019 letter C cyber
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
security program enhancements
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
and from 17 the Statewide archiving
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
assessment would lapse chairman Jack
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah could I just interrupt for a brief
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
moment just for ease of following along
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's a packet that everybody got that
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
has Department of Education on the top
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
of it it's in order
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the lapse extension worksheet so if
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
you as representative Jack gets to say
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game as he did you'll find an
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
email from the director Mason that tells
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
you what he would like to have happen so
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
just so you can follow along
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
people shuffling through papers and if
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going too quickly please stop me
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
because I have it all neatly organized
 
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.029 align:start position:0%
because I have it all neatly organized
here

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
um from judicial branch
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
they would like to delete items 197 and
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 137 and 138
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
from 2017 and 2015.
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
the e-court project presumably that's
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
because those funds are fully expended
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
from legislative branch
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
we want to delete item 139
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh which is state house complex building
 
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.810 align:start position:0%
uh which is state house complex building
maintenance

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission was in and covered
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
this during their full committee
 
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.250 align:start position:0%

their adding more money in this budget

and they have money from 17 that they
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%

to include roof replacement or parking

replacement they covered that when they
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
were here
 
00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:29.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
safety covered theirs when they were
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
here in the full committee uh they want
 
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:38.179 align:start position:0%
to reap they the uh items from 21
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
section 12 2 and 3
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
for the hanger they would like to
 
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:47.659 align:start position:0%
repurpose those to add a renovation
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
component because they don't at this
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
time plan to reconstruct that there's
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
not enough money to do that
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
so they're planning to renovate it
 
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.070 align:start position:0%
so they're planning to renovate it
instead

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
Transportation will be in I skipped
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
safety there's nothing and then um
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
the veterans home
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
they covered this in the fall committee
 
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.850 align:start position:0%
they covered this in the fall committee
presentation

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:18.860 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
uh I guess they're going to lapse the
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
heat pump
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
and then in 223
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
they are prepared to delete that and
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
that has that has 1.293 million dollars
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
in that appropriation that's available
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
for us to use
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
so that covers what I have
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
for the agencies that responded by mail
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
so with that our next agency is in at
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
11. normally we have a more lengthy
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
presentation from administrative
 
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.250 align:start position:0%
presentation from administrative
services

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh but we're in recess until 11 when we
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
the hour being 11 o'clock we will
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
reconvene the subcommittee with the
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
and we have Robert Scott the
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Sue Carlson the Chief
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%

and before we start I'd like to ask you
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
about two items that are not in House
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
Bill 25
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
they are from 2019 letter F
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
comprehensive monitoring for piscataqua
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
region estuaries that will lapse
 
01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
region estuaries that will lapse
and

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
from 2017 letter C clean water srf State
 
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.670 align:start position:0%
from 2017 letter C clean water srf State
match

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
unlike all the other clean water srf
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
State matches that we have one of them I
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
see you want apps but those two are are
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
yeah that's 17 letter c
 
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
okay correct okay with that the floor is
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
yours to say whatever you would like
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks for having us back
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
it seems like it was only Friday I was
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
here for some of you uh so again
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have the handout two
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
handouts uh well they're all one hand
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
out with a table at the end uh so
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll you'll agree with me I
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
uh Sue Carlson's put together uh she's
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
listed listed uh this the the
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate sections for House Bill 25
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
where appropriate and uh
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
the state law but also uh what you'll
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
see in the handout here as as the
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
Preamble says the first sentence uh uh
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
she's tried to group this by by subject
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
matter so you'll see all the dams listed
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
together so uh so I'll go through these
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
quickly again I have the brains of the
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
outfit with me here Sue Carlson so
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
she'll probably it'll be very easy to
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
stump the chump if you will by asking me
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
a question but hopefully uh I know
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that so uh quickly
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'll go through uh the the handout we
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
had uh which talks about section 94 91
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
for hazardous waste so this is the 10
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
percent match that we're required to do
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
for federal Superfund sites so this this
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
the the listed sites here uh are New
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plating and Merrimack Colin
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
Colin achesman Aikman in Farmington and
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
the Savage administrable uh well site in
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
in Milford uh so again I can go into
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
date detail but again this is the
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
coverage the 10 cost match
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh for that so at the Mr chair I don't
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
know if you want to you just keep me
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
keep going or okay
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
so uh then
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
our Center Mills uh just this is for the
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
the new committee members uh Des has put
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
this package together that he given us
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
their section numbers 94 91 81 things
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
like that correspond to our line numbers
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
in this worksheet package so if you're
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
wondering where the Hazardous Waste made
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
and when it's they say section 94 go
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
right to your worksheet it's line number
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
94. it's item number 94. thank you thank
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so going to section 81 I guess
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
would be line 81 uh is for the again
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
we've we've lumped the state revolving
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
loan funds together as we discussed
 
01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:58.730 align:start position:0%
loan funds together as we discussed
um

01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
uh on Friday so we're required to do a
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
20 match for uh most of our srf
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
requirements again Friday we mentioned a
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
couple uh out of the infrastructure Bill
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh that are different but but in this
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
case we're talking about the drinking
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
water uh
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh State revolving Loan Fund and uh and
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
typically so you'll find basically the
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
same narrative for the Clean Water uh
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
srf and the drinking water srf so these
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
projects take multiple years to actually
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
complete uh it which is why you you'll
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
see some some of them on a lapse as we
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
move forward again I can go into detail
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
for any of these but but as as uh are
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
articulated uh we can only all in the
 
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
handout we can only close these projects
 
01:06:48.059 --> 01:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
handout we can only close these projects
out

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
at the completion of construction so you
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
have to you know obviously have design
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
all the way through to construction uh
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
and getting these loans done uh so again
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned so that's section 88 and
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
79 or lines 88 and 79 are are basically
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
the similar again for for the
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
uninitiated clean water is waste water
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
and storm water projects uh those
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
actually tend to take even longer than
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
drinking water projects wastewater
 
01:07:17.289 --> 01:07:17.299 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities that type of thing
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh again if there's no questions I'll
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
move on to lines 86 and line 80. so this
 
01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:25.940 align:start position:0%
is uh Dam reconstruction and repair
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh so we're here we're talking about
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
2019 funds uh in the encumbrance of
 
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.549 align:start position:0%
2019 funds uh in the encumbrance of
those

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
um again what we've seen is some delays
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
in some of the work we we would like to
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
have done uh for Dam repairs uh due to
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
due to covert covid and Associated uh
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
supply chain uh material shortages uh in
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
particularly when you go to the the
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
second half of that paragraph you'll it
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
talks about uh fiscal year 21 and the
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
remaining uh funds for that and that
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
that is for ongoing work uh at cops pond
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
dam in tuft tomorrow uh which we expect
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
to be done uh earlier this year and uh
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
kilton pond dam and Grafton and we're
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we're expecting it to start
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
construction at the Highland Lake Dam
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and starter and
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
and design work on Pawtuckaway uh dams
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
will be starting this summer so as a
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a factoid the design work we
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
typically do as a discreet thing before
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
we obviously before we start
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
construction but that that's uh you'll
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
understand a necessary thing to be done
 
01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:39.650 align:start position:0%
understand a necessary thing to be done
first

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.930 align:start position:0%
first
uh

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm confused you guys did a
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of the dam and Stoddard
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
on Highland Lake within 10 years or so
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
you just did a building a dish uh onto
 
01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:58.970 align:start position:0%
you just did a building a dish uh onto
the

01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
property in the last three years what
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
else are you doing there
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
you know typically we do these this work
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
in phases so I I may have to
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
phone a friend of Randy Pelletier if if
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
you would like so yeah I'm not sure I
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
think they're still Spillway work we
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
were looking at but you're going to
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
your your interest in that particular
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
so uh keeping on the topic of dams
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
generally so we were very pleased to
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a new facility and on silk Farm
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
Road Ted cover's not here I would I
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
would I'll thank him in his absence
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
anyways you know uh admin Services
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
Public Works did a great job uh there's
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly large project uh just to brag
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
on that for a little bit for years we've
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
we've had a facility on on a river
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're where we've just vacated and uh
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of the it was a little bit very
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
dilapidated very old historic though uh
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
and we a lot of our materials in case of
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
a flood and emergency were stored there
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
well the problem with that is among
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
other things is in a flood zone so that
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
seemed kind of
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive and maybe not smart uh
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
so this this facility is is a new on uh
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
silk Farm Road we're very pleased with
 
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
it uh it it not only includes
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the damn Bureau uh operations and and
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh uh facilities there place
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
for their trucks and whatnot but also
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
for our Watershed and emergency response
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh cleanup also so it's a great facility
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
I say all that my intention is my hope
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
is sometime when the weather clears this
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
spring early summer to do some kind of
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
ribbon cutting there so if you're so
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
interested we would love to have you
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
um we're very proud of it uh so any case
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh so that so lines uh 87 and 92 have to
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
do with that the remaining
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations is really for cleanup as
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
we finish up any last punch items on the
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
punch list items on that building
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh line 93 is for the Ossipee Lake Dam
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's another cleanup issue uh that was
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
a a great project I think for Ossipee
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
Lake we actually use the old Dam uh as a
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
basically a coffer Dam while we've we
 
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
constructed the the new one uh lake oski
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
is very flashy so this was uh we had to
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
lower the level probably more than some
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the boaters will like but uh as as we
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
reminded them that's better than the
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
alternative which is not to do the
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance and not to have the water
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
there uh but any case uh this this was a
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
good project also and uh again the
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
remaining monies being used to do some
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
some cleanup uh uh around that Dam uh as
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
far as uh punch list items uh including
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
the scada system for instance
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
um a line 95 uh is uh again this is a a
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
a fairly ongoing project so it's it
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
stemmed from the the 2006 uh
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
issues with this the Suncook River where
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
it jumped its Bank uh so that's by and
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
large uh mostly done as you drive down
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
Route four depending on the direction
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
you're going you can you can see the
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
armoring of the bank uh in that uh
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's taken a little bit longer to
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
totally finish uh there's the the the
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
the the soils and whatnot on that river
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
river bank where they have armored it
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
are have not been completely stabilized
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
the sinkholes and that type of thing
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
have developed so this is ongoing work
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
to to finish that up
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh line 90 and 82 uh have to do with our
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
our One-Stop system and and we had uh
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
for those who were here we had assistant
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh Sanborn talking to that
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
um on Friday so we've issued an RFP we
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
we expect
 
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:11.810 align:start position:0%
we expect
um

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know within a few months here we'll
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
have we'll have obligated These funds uh
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:22.090 align:start position:0%
uh section 97 uh it has to do with
 
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:22.729 align:start position:0%
uh section 97 uh it has to do with
[Music]

01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:22.739 --> 01:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
air monitoring equipment or flood
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
forecasting or stream gauges and some
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
database up upgrades uh so again that
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
work is underway
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh section or line uh 98 84. uh again
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
Friday uh we talked about the
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin uh so again
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is not General funds and and uh
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
comes out of the user fees and this is
 
01:13:48.659 --> 01:13:50.050 align:start position:0%
comes out of the user fees and this is
for

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:50.060 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
projects uh on those systems so again we
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
have 13 pump stations in the wastewater
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
treatment facility itself so uh as you
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
may imagine aging infrastructure uh
 
01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:06.140 align:start position:0%
takes money to repair uh and replace
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh and I think I'm getting to the end
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then we have a
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
we have an Easter egg at the end here so
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh that's coming soon here we're going
 
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
to suggest we give some money back
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
um so then we have coastal flooding uh
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
which modeling which is uh lines 83 and
 
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.310 align:start position:0%
which modeling which is uh lines 83 and
85.

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
85.
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh and that's uh
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
that project was delayed due to due to
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
getting the right data set to go with
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
that so that's moving forward but we are
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
delayed on that so that's that's why
 
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's listed and as I mentioned uh
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
on page seven of the handout uh we have
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
suggested you'd there'd be a deletion uh
 
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
and and to we're asking for a lapse of
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
funds uh as you see here regarding to
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
one of our natural resources
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
conservation service dams uh and the the
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
real issue not that we wouldn't love to
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
have money for that but there basically
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're not ready for that construction to
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
be done yet so we're kind of out of
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
cycle in advance so that's that's that I
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
don't know if so you want to talk to the
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
two issues the chair mentioned I'm
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
try to remember the the two
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
the 2017 no no no we're all set okay we
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
didn't put them on the list because
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
they're fully expensive okay all right
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
all right so with that if there's
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
certainly any questions or I can
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
elaborate more or or less hopefully for
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
you I don't know thank you I'll just
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee that the uh
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
on the section 96 slaps would uh free up
 
01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
and representative Mills thank you Mr
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
chair this is just once again for the
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
new people on this that doesn't don't
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
know exactly how to follow along
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
what we've basically done is gone
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
through items 75 I'm sorry 79
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
through 98 in our handout
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the only one that we are they're
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
requesting to keep all their lapses keep
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
all their money going with the exception
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
of line 96 where we're going to recover
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
1.155 million dollars
 
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
so 89 we're going to delete that's fully
 
01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:36.110 align:start position:0%
so 89 we're going to delete that's fully
expended

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Boyd thank you Mr
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner and director
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
Carlson thank you very much very quickly
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
in a slightly parochial request is it
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
possible to get an update on the New
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plating site in Merrimack
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
just where where we are and how far
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
we've come
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful thank you so
 
01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.770 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful thank you so
much

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman seeing no further
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
questions was there anything else you
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to say
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for coming
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
we want to keep our dams in good repair
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
because obviously many of them there's a
 
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:17.540 align:start position:0%
life safety
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
component to having it fail so thank you
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
very much for doing that
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
and our representative Eden
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
just on the the sun cook River didn't
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
when that did the flood didn't that take
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
a new Trail or a new Direction and did
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
you have to stay with the New Direction
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
do you have to go back to the old
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
Direction order to do a divided split
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
yep it jumped
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
and has gone on and you had to stay with
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
the New Path and when that happened
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
because of the floodplain there were a
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
significant amount of buyouts by FEMA
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
right some 24 people took money and left
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
their property because it's in the
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
floodplained so it's been a really
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
successful project and once they
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
stabilize the sinkhole of the plant
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
vegetation more vegetation and hopefully
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to put some closure on that
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that always tried to remember
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
to find out what happened because that
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
was a
 
01:18:27.179 --> 01:18:28.850 align:start position:0%
was a
significant

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll just remind everyone this
 
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
this is going out over live stream so no
 
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
one on the live stream heard that answer
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
because the gentleman is not at a
 
01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
because the gentleman is not at a
microphone

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
you try to paraphrase if you like but
 
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
for the for the listening audience so
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
again the the river had jumped its banks
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the for the most part we've it the
 
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
question was did it we follow the old
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
try to keep it on the old path of the
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
New Path and the short answer is uh it's
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
still following A New Path and there
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
were some buyouts from FEMA for roughly
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
25 properties uh that were in the flood
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
plain and and again so that this project
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
the remaining monies are to uh continue
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
to stabilize and do plantings uh again
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're getting it was a very challenging
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
location to try to stabilize that
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
portion of the river uh near the bridge
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
a chair just a brief question
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
please representative Jarvis thank you
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
you talked about scada earlier in one of
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the line items and do you have a control
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
point where you have monitoring the dams
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
and is there you got scada I'm guessing
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
you have alerts and maybe some video
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
real time
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh all that's more more for the future
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
most of our dams do not uh I think we
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
have what six seven right now uh the
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
recipe is getting it uh as we speak
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things they're they're
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
still refining uh so you know as we move
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
forward we're looking at more use of
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
more video that we can see remotely uh
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
and securely uh and uh obviously the
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
skate a part of that also which is why
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know we we have stream gauges that
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
type of thing and those those
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
Integrations are important moving
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
forward but by and large there's what
 
01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:24.500 align:start position:0%
600 and I mean 200 over 260 or so
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams I think it's actually
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
higher than that and very few of them
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
have uh Control Systems uh as you
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
discussed although I think that's needed
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
is so just briefly
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
for the ones we'll monitoring now that
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
goes back to
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
a point or a place in your office where
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see the alarm
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further thank you very
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
much for coming
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.729 --> 01:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
all right the hour being 10 30. uh we
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
can reconvene the subcommittee with the
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections we have Helen
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
Hanks the commissioner and John Hanson
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
um good morning good morning and for the
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
record again Helen Hanks uh commissioner
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Corrections to my
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
right is John Hanson our director of
 
01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.450 align:start position:0%
right is John Hanson our director of
administration

01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so we're happy to sit and talk with
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
you about projects that are previously
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
funded and their status and I'll turn it
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
over for John to take the lead on that
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we have a handout which I think
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
everyone got around I'm actually on page
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
two but it is numbered one at the bottom
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
and these are our existing capital
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
budget projects as we have them now and
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side is listed the
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
actual budgeted amount from the
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
beginning from the house bill 25s from
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
over multiple bienniums that contain
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
that money so the first one the exterior
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
door Replacements that first item there
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is a one that's going to lapse is
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
about 79 in that one which is going to
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
go to lapse
 
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
um the second one is a door project
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is going to be going out this
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
summer and that's to complete the
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
exterior doors and for those of you
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
won't on the committee at that time we
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
have a substantial number of exterior
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
doors at that facility which are rotted
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
out at the bottom due to salt and sand
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
and everything else we've done to them
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
and it just we need to replace them this
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
is the one that I cannot find in House
 
01:33:38.649 --> 01:33:38.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 25
 
01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
so if we can find out the line when that
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
one that you don't want to lapse was
 
01:33:45.719 --> 01:33:47.209 align:start position:0%
one that you don't want to lapse was
appropriated

01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:33:47.219 --> 01:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
appropriated
sure

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry on page nine uh the section
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
about halfway down
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay so you're looking at this here
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh boiler replacement store controller
 
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh boiler replacement store controller
upgrades

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
what I have is a door replacement in 19
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
letter f
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that is not listed in House Bill 25 so
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
wood lapse and another door replacement
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
in 17 letter e that is also not listed
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
and would lapse
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
okay on the sheet that was just handles
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
would be number 67 which is the the next
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
oh all right
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
so the one that is not lapsing is from
 
01:34:39.719 --> 01:34:41.390 align:start position:0%
so the one that is not lapsing is from
2111.

01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
2111.
 
01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
2111.
correct

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
this is the what we did initially on
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
this one is some of you may remember we
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
went out at a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
each at first and thankfully you folks
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
upgraded that to two hundred thousand
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
dollars on those doors
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
so there was three separate times we
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
have some money for that over a period
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
I can continue the body alarm you all
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
set with that one thing so the body
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
alignment camera project that one was
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
two million six hundred twenty five
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar project that will
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
continue in the last page of this I'll
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
go over the continuances kitchen
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
renovation and design 4.3 million
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
electrical service 265 000 perimeter and
 
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
security defense detection systems this
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
top section if you haven't found already
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
these are all for just a Concord Men's
 
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.050 align:start position:0%
these are all for just a Concord Men's
prison

01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
um 1.6 million roof Replacements various
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
roofs 1.8 million boiler Replacements
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
2.1 million
 
01:35:43.209 --> 01:35:43.219 align:start position:0%
uh Heating and Cooling uh
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
cooling coil Replacements 125 000 the
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
sewer grind is 670 000 steam lines 2.5
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
million roof Replacements 2 million
 
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh air handle and duct work that's the
 
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
arpa funded project and that was
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
increased and now it's at 3.2 million
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
CCU door and ceiling replacement repairs
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
300 000 and the medium custody you know
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
South bathroom project which is
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
completed 650 thousand dollars
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I will just add on all of these
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
projects we've had to get very creative
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we've had to downscale what we
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
initially intended
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
um just to one typical example a project
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
is done the medium custody north south
 
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
bathroom was 24 bathrooms when we
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
originally got estimates the concept was
 
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
replaced all fixtures all tiles all
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
showers epoxy the floors when we got
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
right down to it we only had money and
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
we had to negotiate with a low bidder
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
for 16 bathrooms and we used the
 
01:36:35.699 --> 01:36:37.270 align:start position:0%
for 16 bathrooms and we used the
existing

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
fixtures in that those bathrooms and put
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
in new showers and epoxy the floors
 
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
through value engineering we're able to
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
do I believe 20 total bathrooms out of
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
that project so there's still four
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we couldn't even touch that's
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
just an example of what we had to do to
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that we got as much done as we
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
can versus coming back to two or four
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
years later saying you know that money
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
you gave us a couple years ago we need
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
another x amount of money we're seeing
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
that more and more and then the bottom
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
section of the projects in Berlin roof
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
Replacements at a million dollars dual
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
controller upgrades door controller
 
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
upgrade is different to the other door
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
projects just so you'll know the Dual
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
controller upgrades is most our doors
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
run on a system where there's a solenoid
 
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
you push a button it goes through a
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
solenoid and out and opens a door either
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
pneumatically or electrically and those
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
systems in Berlin need to be upgraded
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
they have a life of about 20 years and
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're right there now so this was an odd
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
one though we actually got ahead of it
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then the door started to fail so
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing we got that money in
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
place quickly and then the Primitive
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
security defense detection systems in
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin that's a big one 1.5 million and
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
that will include a fence line which has
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
some sinkholes uh where the the fence is
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually uh you can crawl underneath the
 
01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:51.179 align:start position:0%
back of the fence so just put it that
 
01:37:51.179 --> 01:37:52.669 align:start position:0%
back of the fence so just put it that
way

01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
in a prison that's not a good thing
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
um access road project was completed and
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
again that was scaled back we intended
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
to pave the entire parking lot and we
 
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
only were able to do the access road and
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
part of the Perimeter Road and some of
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
the drainage
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the last one is the construction
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
trades building
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
in the following Pages it gets in a more
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
granular detail I don't know how much Mr
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
chairman you want to do on this but I
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
can go over anything you want on any of
 
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
these projects in in as much detail as
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm a little concerned that we
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the that that we haven't
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
correlated the lines that are lapsing to
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
what's still going on so if you'll
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
indulge for me
 
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.950 align:start position:0%
indulge for me
uh

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
we learned that we should delete
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
our line 73 the body alarm man down
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
system because that's complete
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
no that's not complete uh so we've asked
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
for that to be extended um
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
that that's the project is completed
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
from the contractor standpoint there's
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
left and in order to finish what we need
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
to finish we're buying those products
 
01:38:59.689 --> 01:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
outside of the contractors purchase
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
process which includes a substantial
 
01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:03.169 align:start position:0%
process which includes a substantial
markup

01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
markup
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to it's over 15
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
um much over it I believe so we're
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
buying a lot of those components
 
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
ourselves and we've asked for that to be
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
lapsed next time around all right so the
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
initial information we had was we were
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to delete 73 but now uh we're not
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
the body line our policy would be to
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
leave it there unless we're absolutely
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
sure that every bill for the project has
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
been paid
 
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
right at the moment we're sitting here
 
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
at the moment sitting here I don't
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
believe no it's not so I will leave that
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
in that's not an issue
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
um the electronic controls and security
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
camera installation from 17 letter f
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh is not in the house bill 25.
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're definitely not we're definitely
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
not working on the same sheet of music
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
with you today and we apologize in
 
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.810 align:start position:0%
with you today and we apologize in
advance

01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
yeah we're working on what we're working
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
on it's not an item that's why it would
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
lapse unless we do something to put it
 
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.410 align:start position:0%
lapse unless we do something to put it
in

01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
nope

01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
well the problem is these are not in
 
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:19.100 align:start position:0%
possible 25.
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
I guess even in so our exterior door
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
we were simply working off the
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
um capital budget which is our section
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
is on page nine of his proposed capital
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
was there anything else you wanted to
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
say I what I'll do is after we break
 
01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'll go through my list and we'll check
 
01:40:55.260 --> 01:41:00.050 align:start position:0%
I'll go through my list and we'll check
it

01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
because there appear to be several
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
projects that are not in House Bill 25
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:16.139 align:start position:0%
so we can go I can go down just right
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head here on starting
 
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
on your page five I believe on your
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
capital budget lapse extension worksheet
 
01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
um with item number 57 that one should
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
not lapse
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
that is one that hasn't even gone out to
 
01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
bid yet yeah the first the first one
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
that would lapse is is between 71 and
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
so the electrical services number 71
 
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
that project starts this spring
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
so that that money needs to stay so we
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
can pay the contractor
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
um 72
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh that's that one has not uh started
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
work so that one would need to stay
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's 350 000 dollars
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh item number 73
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
is the one we just talked about and
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's the one that needs to stay
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we have money in there we're
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
going to buy our we are buying equipment
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
as we speak for that
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and I'm talking about well components
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
to that system
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh and then 74.
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
it starts at the
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
top of that is Department of Education
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so the so I have from 19
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
letter D generated replacement that is
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
not in house bill 25.
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
oh okay back on the beginning of the 19.
 
01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.510 align:start position:0%
oh okay back on the beginning of the 19.
uh

01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's 19. that's right we talked
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
about letter E the access road that
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
so we're not looking we're looking at
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
page two the item 19 that's administered
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
these are items that are that were
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
appropriated that are not in House Bill
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
25 and would lapse unless we add them
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
and what I'm trying to do now is make
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
sure that the projects are complete and
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
can lapse
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
okay I guess the easiest way to do this
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
from uh everyone's standpoint if you
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
flip to the back page of our
 
01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:16.250 align:start position:0%
flip to the back page of our
presentation

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
these are the items that we have as
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
lapsing so the exterior door
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
Replacements the one we talked about
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
medium custody north south bathroom
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
renovation we talked about
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
the generator Replacements and the
 
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
access road project were the four that
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
we have on our list as as uh being able
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
to lapse and that money go back to the
 
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:42.590 align:start position:0%
to lapse and that money go back to the
fund

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
everything else on that list would stay
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I could we could
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
um probably take a minute and correlate
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
all that back to your worksheets all
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
right I have one well they're not on the
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
worksheet because they're not in house
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill 25.
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
so in uh the governor's proposed which
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
as you say it would be House Bill 25.
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
we're satisfied with what's on page nine
 
01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:20.450 align:start position:0%
we're satisfied with what's on page nine
okay

01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah there's nothing on there that that
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
word concerns us there's nothing that's
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
I wish I'd had that I uh we're all
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
looking at different things through this
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
through this time frame uh frame trying
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
to determine what we have for laughs
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative bogert
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
could you please go ahead and correlate
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
that page 20 I noticed there's some
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
whichever color you call them yellow
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
that are lapsing can you give me the
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
coordinates to
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
which item numbers of the yes please yes
 
01:45:07.139 --> 01:45:09.770 align:start position:0%
which item numbers of the yes please yes
okay

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
we start
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we'd have to pull up the I don't
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
have the uh I have apparently confused
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
the committee uh if a the reason you're
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
not finding them in hospital 25 is
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
because they're lapsing
 
01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:40.669 align:start position:0%
because they're lapsing
okay

01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
the flaw would be if there were a
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
project that was ongoing that was
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
inadvertently omitted from houseboat 25
 
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
and needs to be added because it's still
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
ongoing and otherwise they wouldn't be
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
able to spend the money that okay I'm
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing my head's got around this now
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
so they have told us that there is
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
nothing that needs to be added to House
 
01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:02.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 25
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
and so these items in yellow are
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
projects that are complete so there is
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
no number in hospital 25 that they
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:13.970 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
so everything that we have in House Bill
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
25 items 57
 
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.609 align:start position:0%
25 items 57
Rue

01:46:21.609 --> 01:46:21.619 align:start position:0%
Rue
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
73 you wish to have extended yes
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
yes see thank you
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:31.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
Friday

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:34.669 align:start position:0%
Friday
[Laughter]

01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
and they're they're in uh
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
in an item uh
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
well the item the generator item there's
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars that we can use
 
01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:48.290 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars that we can use
yes

01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
that was one we did with owned forces we
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
didn't go to public works I'm sorry we
 
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
did not go through public works on that
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
project and that was so I were able to
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
I could go through any of these in
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
detail if you want to know why we have
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
some of these projects still continuing
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
but whatever information you need we had
 
01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh given that with Hospital 25 is
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
correct as it stands uh
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
That's How we'll leave it
 
01:47:21.719 --> 01:47:23.270 align:start position:0%
That's How we'll leave it
excellent

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone we're we apologize
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
for not seemingly be so prepared today
 
01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:31.139 align:start position:0%
I apologize for confusing the committee
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
and trying to go into an area that I
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
well that well till we meet again we'll
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
all be on the same page
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
tanned out from today I don't see why
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
not all right thank you
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
comment is uh an addition to be built
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the existing kitchen
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
so that's going to
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
mean it it seems as though the very
 
01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
little bit that I know about the
 
01:48:12.129 --> 01:48:12.139 align:start position:0%
facility that kitchen
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
that I don't think you can do much more
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
with it and congratulations on the tarp
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
system that has whatever so this would
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
be an adjacent
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
thing that will be serviceable for maybe
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
the next few years until you get them
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative excellent question
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
um our plan would be at this point um if
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 goes through and the
 
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
additional money is allocated to build a
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
new Men's prison we actually won't be
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
doing that two floor additional prison
 
01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
outside uh prison kitchen outside that
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
area into the prison yard that's going
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
to be something that we would maintain
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
at an existing location using the
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
additional money the money that we have
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
allocated now to renovate existing in
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
place we're going to be working hand in
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
hand with public health to make sure we
 
01:48:59.570 --> 01:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
do it right to get through to the next
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
phase which would be building a new
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
facility so we need another 7.1 million
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
dollars on top of the 4.3 to do that
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
freestanding kitchen that will not need
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
to happen now if we go this route
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
safe to say if hb2 and the money
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
allocated as the governor's contemplated
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
passes we won't be back to ask for more
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
money we're just going to try to shore
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
up the space until a new facility is
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
built if a new prison is not built we
 
01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
will need an additional seven plus
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars to build this two-story
 
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.930 align:start position:0%
million dollars to build this two-story
structure

01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
on top of the existing 4.3 allocated so
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
over 10 million dollars to build a
 
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:44.270 align:start position:0%
over 10 million dollars to build a
kitchen

01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay I just have a couple questions
 
01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:51.290 align:start position:0%
okay I just have a couple questions
thanks

01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:51.950 align:start position:0%
thanks
um

01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
I gather from the summary a minute ago
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
all everything listed in the uh in in
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
you want to continue to to have open and
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
then but the question I have is with
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
your list here
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
if you have on the last page of your
 
01:50:12.530 --> 01:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
presentation there's some items are we
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to get money back from any of
 
01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.229 align:start position:0%
going to get money back from any of
these

01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
projects that have shown
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
um did it I guess they would be ones
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
that are not listed in here but you've
 
01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
completed and
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing thanks thank you
 
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar and I apologize
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
again for the confusion the projects
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
listed on page one are also listed on
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
page 20. and on page 20 the items that
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
are yellow or shaded those wood laps
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
those monies would go back to the dermal
 
01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:43.580 align:start position:0%
fund everything else that's in white
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're asking for continuation to
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
continue to shore up those projects as
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
we navigate okay
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
like to continue then so
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
someone which the items here that we're
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
going to get money back for what do they
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
relate to that's in hb25 it's not
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're not there because we did not ask
 
01:51:04.729 --> 01:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
for them to continue in any way shape or
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
form okay so I'm just trying to figure
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
out is before getting money back
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
how much is it
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
um but how are we going to do that is it
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh don't we have to have it in here and
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
then what we will do is we will add
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
language if we decide to use this money
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
we will add language to hospital 25 that
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
lapses this amount and then reallocates
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
it to another project if you were to
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
look back at the bill we passed in in
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
2021 there's a couple examples of that
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
there are but that I realize that that's
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do in this case so
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to gain some money from this
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you the money doesn't actually
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
come to the general fund it's bonded
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
indebtedness that was never spent
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
so it can go into bonded indeedness for
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
something else so roughly 76 thousand
 
01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
something else so roughly 76 thousand
dollars

01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative new one yes just a a
 
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I remember correctly I
 
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
looked at the large
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
white uh request book last week for a
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
little while
 
01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:10.139 align:start position:0%
are there there are and I believe I saw
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Corrections for
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the new prison there was a low a Midway
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
point and then a high number for a an
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
estimated projected cost is that correct
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
in the presentation we shared uh last
 
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
week we showed you our work we did with
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer to ascertain What
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
bond ratings would look like because we
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
were doing that exploration and we have
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
been we just wanted to share that back
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee that we were being
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
mindful about how would the state do
 
01:52:45.070 --> 01:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the slide in the
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
last presentation no I'm I'm talking
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
about a a page in the whatever you call
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
that big white book that's in that room
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
over there
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I looked at notes on the bottom and
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
it seems that there were three numbers
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
for a proposed new prison cost a lower
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
medium and a high number so where I'm
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
going is I'm hoping that nobody says
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
well let's put the loan number in and
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
approve that if that's just a wish list
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you're absolutely
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
right and at this point I think all of
 
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
our experience with projects tells us we
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
were doing our best estimating at the
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
time right and the high number is the
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
safer number to go with at this point
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
Thank you you're welcome thank you for
 
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out that at this moment
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's not this committee's task to
 
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money there's another
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
committee down the hall that is working
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
on that so
 
01:53:42.239 --> 01:53:43.310 align:start position:0%
on that so
uh

01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
that that's not up to us to determine
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you for coming if there are
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
no questions and
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
we'll say anything else thank you very
 
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
much for coming thank you everyone have
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
a great week and be safe tomorrow our
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
next committee what's our next committee
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
is Health and Human Services at 1 pm
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be in recess until
 
01:54:10.020 --> 01:56:10.490 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be in recess until
then

01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
the cleanup will be done overnight all
 
01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
right the last time I looked it looked
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
like the snow was supposed to stop about
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock Tuesday night Tuesday night
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
we'll all be over it's supposed to start
 
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
tonight is rain
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
that's why they can't figure out how
 
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
much right it's going to be snow
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
once it's going to start tonight around
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
eight nine o'clock as rain and then
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
whenever it changes over to something
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
what's going to go where you are in the
 
01:57:19.739 --> 01:57:21.010 align:start position:0%
what's going to go where you are in the
state

01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:21.020 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's right now they're
 
01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
saying Nashville around noon tomorrow
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
starting with snow so I'm assuming where
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
you you're a dairy man yeah so you're
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
probably gonna Dairy is looking for snow
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
the hour being one o'clock we'll
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
reconvene the committee and we'll
 
03:04:14.570 --> 03:04:14.580 align:start position:0%

03:04:26.929 --> 03:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
have to worry about them so my name is
 
03:04:28.849 --> 03:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
Chris santanello I'm an associate
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%

whatever you want to cover please do
 
03:04:47.450 --> 03:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
sure um so I think I think Chris did
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
hand out a um worksheet and basically
 
03:04:52.790 --> 03:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
the department we are closing out 13
 
03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
projects this fiscal year with a total
 
03:04:58.450 --> 03:04:58.460 align:start position:0%
um lapse amount of
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
4.4 million 282 557.
 
03:05:06.650 --> 03:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
um which we would like to request an
 
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 25 to utilize
 
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
just about 1.4 million dollars
 
03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
um for the Glencliff wastewater
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
treatment improvements needed to avoid
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
compliance violation and emergency
 
03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
compliance violation and emergency
repairs

03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and then the remaining 19 capital
 
03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
projects we are requesting that the
 
03:05:33.250 --> 03:05:33.260 align:start position:0%
funds of about 112 million 695
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
339 do not lapse so that we can continue
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
to work on those projects in the next
 
03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:39.830 align:start position:0%
to work on those projects in the next
biennium

03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
those I believe are in
 
03:05:46.750 --> 03:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 starting in section 12
 
03:05:57.889 --> 03:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.730 --> 03:06:00.740 align:start position:0%
and our goal was to not necessarily
 
03:06:03.650 --> 03:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time on each project but
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
leave it to the committee task specific
 
03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
questions if you have and right now
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
um Christopher Shea Justin
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
requested that I do a crosswalk between
 
03:06:16.849 --> 03:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
hb25a as introduced with the pro the
 
03:06:20.750 --> 03:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
line numbers like 10 101 through 120 for
 
03:06:22.610 --> 03:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
our handout so I'm putting that together
 
03:06:24.650 --> 03:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
to resubmit I actually just finished
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
that so maybe we can do it
 
03:06:29.210 --> 03:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
as we go
 
03:06:33.170 --> 03:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.849 --> 03:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
so why don't we go through the projects
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
that you want to lapse and I'll identify
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
the line numbers
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.610 --> 03:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay so the first project that we have
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
on the handout is the New Hampshire
 
03:06:52.370 --> 03:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
hospital air upgrades and Ellen I'm not
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
sure if you want me to bring you up
 
03:06:58.250 --> 03:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
do you want Dave just to go through that
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and if you have questions on the
 
03:07:04.610 --> 03:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
projects we can bring people up
 
03:07:06.889 --> 03:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
does that work well all right I'll walk
 
03:07:09.230 --> 03:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
through what we saw for dotes and this
 
03:07:11.389 --> 03:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be line 117 that you would
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
request to delete
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes so on line 117 there's a remaining
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
amount of one thousand two hundred and
 
03:07:22.490 --> 03:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars that is not encumbered
 
03:07:25.849 --> 03:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
that we would be looking to lapse the
 
03:07:29.210 --> 03:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
encumbered amount of 11 282 which is the
 
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
remaining fund we is still uncovered on
 
03:07:34.010 --> 03:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
the contract and we need to complete the
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
contract for that
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
and then the next project electronic
 
03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
visit verification system which I
 
03:07:43.730 --> 03:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
believe is line 104 that's line 104.
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you on that project specifically
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
we have a planned amount
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
um for the contract to expend through
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year
 
03:08:00.650 --> 03:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
um looking at a partial lapse of 3.71
 
03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
million or 3 million seven hundred and
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars this is the project
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
that we would we would request either
 
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
one of two options either
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
adding additional scope to this project
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
to support the glencliffe waste
 
03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Treatment Services or utilize
 
03:08:20.050 --> 03:08:20.060 align:start position:0%
it the the lapse amount to be re
 
03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the Glencliff
 
03:08:25.250 --> 03:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the full committee yet
 
03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
but I would imagine we would want to add
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
it as a line item and then add language
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
when we present our findings
 
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
the the next project is the auto mailing
 
03:08:48.290 --> 03:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
system and this one is already not in HP
 
03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:49.929 align:start position:0%
system and this one is already not in HP
25.

03:08:49.929 --> 03:08:49.939 align:start position:0%
25.
 
03:08:49.939 --> 03:08:51.650 align:start position:0%
25.
foreign

03:08:51.650 --> 03:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:08:55.130 --> 03:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
so that one we we only have 394 dollars
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
left in the account and
 
03:08:59.389 --> 03:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
um that we would look to we were
 
03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
assuming wood laps and there's an
 
03:09:03.250 --> 03:09:03.260 align:start position:0%
existing encumbrance of
 
03:09:06.410 --> 03:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
6276 that would be
 
03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the next line item is the access tunnel
 
03:09:18.650 --> 03:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's Line 120 in HP 25.
 
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:22.610 --> 03:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
in this one we're looking to lapse the
 
03:09:27.710 --> 03:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of 36 654 dollars
 
03:09:36.130 --> 03:09:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:40.330 --> 03:09:40.340 align:start position:0%
that is I mean one
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
twenty one twenty six
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and this one as you see in our notes
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
the last payment was was processed
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
subsequent to this biennial budget and
 
03:09:54.650 --> 03:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
we would be expecting to lapse the
 
03:09:58.190 --> 03:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of 3883 dollars
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
the next one is the electronic health
 
03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:07.969 align:start position:0%
the next one is the electronic health
recording

03:10:07.969 --> 03:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
recording
 
03:10:09.490 --> 03:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
that's line
 
03:10:13.250 --> 03:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
128 128
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
and this project is
 
03:10:18.290 --> 03:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
complete as well and we would be looking
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
to lapse five thousand nine hundred and
 
03:10:23.330 --> 03:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:26.410 --> 03:10:26.420 align:start position:0%
the next project is the Glencliff water
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is already not in hb25
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
so the the actual encumbrance of
 
03:10:40.610 --> 03:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
5984 dollars will be liquidated and then
 
03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
5984 dollars will be liquidated and then
lapsed

03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.690 --> 03:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
that is line 125.
 
03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
and this project
 
03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:57.290 align:start position:0%
and this project
um

03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
through is complete and we would be
 
03:10:59.819 --> 03:11:01.389 align:start position:0%
through is complete and we would be
lapsing

03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
lapsing
 
03:11:05.450 --> 03:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
the next project is the Howard Rec
 
03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.630 align:start position:0%
the next project is the Howard Rec
Auditorium

03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.420 --> 03:11:27.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:11:27.370 --> 03:11:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.380 --> 03:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%

03:11:31.130 --> 03:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
121.
 
03:11:32.570 --> 03:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that project is complete and we
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
would be lapsing 25 711 dollars
 
03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
the next one is the New Hampshire
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
hospital electronic
 
03:11:43.380 --> 03:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
hospital electronic
and

03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's also from the same year
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
that is 123
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that that project the current
 
03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
encumbrance will need to be finalized to
 
03:11:58.670 --> 03:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
close out the project however the
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
remaining balance of twenty six thousand
 
03:12:02.929 --> 03:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
two hundred thirteen dollars would be
 
03:12:02.939 --> 03:12:07.730 align:start position:0%
two hundred thirteen dollars would be
lapsed

03:12:07.730 --> 03:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
the next project is Barn boiler
 
03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:17.570 align:start position:0%
the next project is Barn boiler
replacement

03:12:17.570 --> 03:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
what year is that from 21 that is the
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
2223 budget but the
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
it was for the it was initiated in 2021
 
03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
um funded in 2021
 
03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can find it
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
oh here it is that is already not in HP
 
03:12:35.880 --> 03:12:39.050 align:start position:0%
oh here it is that is already not in HP
25.

03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
okay and that project actually was
 
03:12:45.230 --> 03:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
canceled as it was identified as not
 
03:12:48.050 --> 03:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
being cost effective as the the location
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
where the boiler was is like the roof is
 
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
needed is leaking and needs to be
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
repaired so we canceled that project we
 
03:12:58.910 --> 03:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
did have initial costs um expended for
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
the site prep and everything but the
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of 78 500 would be
 
03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:09.429 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of 78 500 would be
lapsed

03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
the next project is the mmis tech
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that project is complete as of
 
03:13:22.969 --> 03:13:22.979 align:start position:0%
August 2021 and the remaining amount of
 
03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
362 108 dollars it shall be lapsed or
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
should be lapsed
 
03:13:34.010 --> 03:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
then the last project on our completed
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
and this project
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
is complete and the remaining amount of
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
fifty one thousand four hundred and
 
03:13:59.530 --> 03:13:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
and if we go to the remaining projects
 
03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
that we'll go through are the projects
 
03:14:07.070 --> 03:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we have not completed and we would
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
be requesting to not lapse the funds the
 
03:14:15.370 --> 03:14:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative bogert uh just a quick
 
03:14:21.849 --> 03:14:21.859 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr chair there was the
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
Glenn Cliff water for five thousand nine
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty four dollars
 
03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
which was on the I didn't catch what
 
03:14:36.170 --> 03:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:14:47.230 --> 03:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
person the uh there's a project from
 
03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
2015 line a glencliffe home portable
 
03:14:52.969 --> 03:14:52.979 align:start position:0%
water system that is not present in HP
 
03:14:52.979 --> 03:14:55.010 align:start position:0%
water system that is not present in HP
25

03:14:55.010 --> 03:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
25
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
yep there is a phase two which I would
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
assume he will get to that was
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
you are correct well it is still
 
03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
you are correct well it is still
underway

03:15:14.750 --> 03:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
so the next project is the demo Wilkins
 
03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:22.090 align:start position:0%
so the next project is the demo Wilkins
building

03:15:22.090 --> 03:15:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's um line 110.
 
03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:28.610 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's um line 110.
correct

03:15:28.610 --> 03:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that project is still ongoing and
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
with the planned completion of April
 
03:15:34.330 --> 03:15:34.340 align:start position:0%
30th 2023
 
03:15:39.469 --> 03:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
and the full the the amount of 701 325
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
is currently encumbered and we plan to
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:15:57.290 --> 03:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay the next project is the dcyf c c w
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
i s or Child Care child child child care
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
welfare information system and I believe
 
03:16:07.010 --> 03:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
and that project is that specific
 
03:16:13.250 --> 03:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
project was associated with a six-year
 
03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
total product project timeline it's
 
03:16:17.570 --> 03:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
years three and four which was funded
 
03:16:19.969 --> 03:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
for this this biennium
 
03:16:22.730 --> 03:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
and due to some regulations with our
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
Administration for children and families
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and our procurement practices we have as
 
03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
well as the um
 
03:16:31.309 --> 03:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
some of the pandemic impacts on our
 
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
resources that has been delayed and
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
we're looking to complete the first four
 
03:16:36.479 --> 03:16:37.570 align:start position:0%
we're looking to complete the first four
phases

03:16:37.570 --> 03:16:37.580 align:start position:0%
phases
 
03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:49.730 --> 03:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
and then the overarching whole content
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
project would be completed June 30th
 
03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:54.889 align:start position:0%
project would be completed June 30th
2026.

03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.670 --> 03:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
the next project which is on line 106
 
03:17:02.929 --> 03:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
um it says Mars e in security assessment
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
that project is
 
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
um with a completion date of June 30th
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
2024 it is on track to complete on that
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
time frame we initially had an
 
03:17:14.929 --> 03:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
expectation of completing it this June
 
03:17:18.429 --> 03:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
um but due to Resource uh resource um
 
03:17:21.950 --> 03:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
reductions in in allocations towards the
 
03:17:23.450 --> 03:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
pandemic response were about a year
 
03:17:23.460 --> 03:17:27.830 align:start position:0%
pandemic response were about a year
behind

03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
the next project is the new heights Inc
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
and I haven't found the number on that
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.130 --> 03:17:49.140 align:start position:0%

03:17:56.889 --> 03:17:56.899 align:start position:0%
that project is still still in progress
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
we are near completion we estimate a
 
03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2024 completion subsequent to
 
03:18:05.450 --> 03:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
the federal Public Health Emergency
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
unwind and some additional eligibility
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
components for the dental program that
 
03:18:15.530 --> 03:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
the next project is a beneficiary
 
03:18:20.570 --> 03:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
service improvement project and I
 
03:18:25.010 --> 03:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:27.950 --> 03:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
and that project is part of a
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
overarching Medicaid enterprise system
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
strategy reprocurement strategy and we
 
03:18:35.210 --> 03:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
are actually in the process of
 
03:18:38.410 --> 03:18:38.420 align:start position:0%
negotiating some contracts to roll out
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
two components of this solution with the
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
estimated completion of June 30th 2026.
 
03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:48.849 align:start position:0%

original appropriation of 90 million
 
03:19:55.630 --> 03:19:55.640 align:start position:0%

a portion of that a total 24 million

upgrade for the system to
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
to maintain and operate that solution
 
03:20:06.889 --> 03:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
over the next five years as we replace

03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
the next project is the beas which is

Bureau of elderly adults Services
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
systems modernization on line 108.
 
03:20:34.210 --> 03:20:34.220 align:start position:0%
and that amount is
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
6795 427 dollars
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
this project is really dependent upon a
 
03:20:43.490 --> 03:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
project that I'm going to speak about in
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
a moment the developmental I.T remote
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
developmental Services I.T remediation
 
03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
project that has a goal a goal to go
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
live of this summer
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
and then as we do that what we
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
identified is that instead of building
 
03:21:00.410 --> 03:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
three or four different systems we're
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
going to continue to expand that one
 
03:21:05.809 --> 03:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
solution to manage this system's
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
modernization for the elderly Adult
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
Services as well as some other
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
developmental Disability Services as we
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
so as a result it's a sequential
 
03:21:17.690 --> 03:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
implementation and they are different
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
modules so this this project is delayed
 
03:21:23.809 --> 03:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
to September 30th 2024.
 
03:21:23.819 --> 03:21:25.610 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
03:21:27.370 --> 03:21:27.380 align:start position:0%
the next project
 
03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
which indicates replatt op app and I
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't know I know what this one is and
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you about it but I'm trying to
 
03:21:39.530 --> 03:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
find the number this is uh line 129 it's
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
from 2011 re-platform option application
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
so on line 20 129 this is a re-platform
 
03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
of our options application which is the
 
03:21:55.610 --> 03:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
application that supports elderly Adult
 
03:21:58.250 --> 03:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
Services and it is combined with that
 
03:22:01.429 --> 03:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
that line 108 as well as the
 
03:22:03.530 --> 03:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
developmental I.T remediation which is
 
03:22:06.590 --> 03:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
line 103 that we'll talk about next
 
03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
the reason why this one actually hasn't
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
encumbered any funds was as as we went
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
through an Enterprise systems
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
architecturally identified that we were
 
03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
building four or five different systems
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
and actually repeating costs so we're
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce our costs over time
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
and we anticipate this project being
 
03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
completed in September 30th 2024
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
with a goal of looking across all these
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
trying to lapse some of the funds we
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what they are until
 
03:22:37.010 --> 03:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
we get the rfps out and completed but we
 
03:22:38.809 --> 03:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
anticipate it being less than what it
 
03:22:42.969 --> 03:22:42.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
the next project is line 103 for
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
developmental I.T developmental Services
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
I.T remediation
 
03:22:53.150 --> 03:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
this is the project that sort of kicked
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
off the rest of them it was funded for
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
this biennium
 
03:22:58.730 --> 03:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
and it was based off a strategic
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
directions of how do we how do we
 
03:23:03.650 --> 03:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
address the developmental disability
 
03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
services that we offer not only from an
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
I.T system but programmatically which
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
really kicked off a strategy of how that
 
03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
impacted these other capital projects
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
that we're speaking about today
 
03:23:19.010 --> 03:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
this project is anticipated to go live
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
this summer however there will be
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
additional enhancements and work done
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
through September 30th 2024 to finalize
 
03:23:32.090 --> 03:23:32.100 align:start position:0%

03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
Developmental services
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
and this is a the billing component
 
03:23:57.769 --> 03:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
historically it was on a an access like
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
date database and with lots of excel
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
reports which in we're trying to
 
03:24:05.690 --> 03:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
modernize and build off of the
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
developmental Services I.T remediation
 
03:24:10.490 --> 03:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
so that we have a unified process for
 
03:24:10.500 --> 03:24:11.870 align:start position:0%
so that we have a unified process for
billing

03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
billing
 
03:24:14.450 --> 03:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
the the goal is tied to that
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
developmental Services I.T remediation
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
project 103 so that the delivery will be
 
03:24:24.370 --> 03:24:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
the next project is on line 115 and it
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
should be developmental Services I.T
 
03:24:31.319 --> 03:24:32.510 align:start position:0%
should be developmental Services I.T
plan

03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
and that one has a gold go live with
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2024 it
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
it again is associated with those other
 
03:24:43.250 --> 03:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
projects and as you combine all these
 
03:24:43.260 --> 03:24:45.010 align:start position:0%
projects and as you combine all these
together

03:24:45.010 --> 03:24:45.020 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
you would have the total cost for not
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
just one system it's basically the
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
combination of four or five different
 
03:24:55.490 --> 03:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
systems that are working with our area
 
03:24:58.849 --> 03:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
agencies and and within our department
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
the next project is the new heights
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
modernization I don't have the line item
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
for that one
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
I have it it's uh 116.
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
so that project has a gold go live on
 
03:25:23.450 --> 03:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
September 30th
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
um the reason why we said not to lapse
 
03:25:28.929 --> 03:25:28.939 align:start position:0%
it does have an encumbrance of 112 200
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
and we do plan to spend the the total
 
03:25:35.570 --> 03:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
amount that's available to complete this
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
work over the next
 
03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
and as I said in many of the other
 
03:25:47.690 --> 03:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
projects that particular team has been
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
really focused on the federal Public
 
03:25:51.889 --> 03:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency and that caused a
 
03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
severe delay in this biennium
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the previous and then in
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
previous bienniums we had some
 
03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
we had asked some for several of these
 
03:26:03.410 --> 03:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
projects to continue to not lapse due to
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
Resource constraints
 
03:26:06.180 --> 03:26:07.550 align:start position:0%
Resource constraints
um

03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
so the next project
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
is the dcyf Child Welfare which is line
 
03:26:14.100 --> 03:26:16.070 align:start position:0%
is the dcyf Child Welfare which is line
111.

03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
111.
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
and this was the first of three capital
 
03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
requests for the comprehensive child
 
03:26:23.889 --> 03:26:23.899 align:start position:0%
welfare information system
 
03:26:27.050 --> 03:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
capital projects in in that system was
 
03:26:29.929 --> 03:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
really incorporating four different four
 
03:26:31.250 --> 03:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
or five different modules intake
 
03:26:34.010 --> 03:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
assessment case reporting and then uh
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
claims processing
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
as part of that effort
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
um Department of Information Technology
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
and Health and Human Services partnered
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
on deploying a platform called
 
03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:46.910 align:start position:0%
on deploying a platform called
Salesforce

03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
Salesforce
 
03:26:49.250 --> 03:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
and from that perspective we we actually
 
03:26:50.450 --> 03:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
needed to work with information
 
03:26:53.690 --> 03:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
technology to build that foundation for
 
03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
the solution prior to actually getting
 
03:26:57.610 --> 03:26:57.620 align:start position:0%
the application running
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
I'll give an example of how that worked
 
03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
so you understand these there's three
 
03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
projects these two for TCU the c-west
 
03:27:08.809 --> 03:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
they were from previous bienniums and
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
then the one that we presented on last
 
03:27:14.210 --> 03:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
week those are the total amounts to
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
build on top of that platform that it
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
the I.T Department helped us build the
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
foundation for over the last several
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
years and we anticipate having a
 
03:27:26.450 --> 03:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
contract completed this summer and
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a 6 to 18 month
 
03:27:32.210 --> 03:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
timeline and we do anticipate having a
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
go live of this project on December 31st
 
03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:42.170 align:start position:0%
go live of this project on December 31st
2024.

03:27:42.170 --> 03:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
the next one that we have is uh I
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's line 112 for Glencliff
 
03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
believe it's line 112 for Glencliff
water

03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
it's like corn thank you
 
03:27:54.769 --> 03:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
and that one is
 
03:27:58.010 --> 03:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
that one is it was gold at completion of
 
03:28:00.769 --> 03:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2025. we need to keep this
 
03:28:02.690 --> 03:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
project open to really support the
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
remaining committed work to related to
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
that potable water system that we were
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
speaking about earlier on that other
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
project that we were we are lapsing the
 
03:28:13.010 --> 03:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
funds on so this one we need to not
 
03:28:14.809 --> 03:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
lapse the funds so we can complete that
 
03:28:14.819 --> 03:28:19.630 align:start position:0%
lapse the funds so we can complete that
work

03:28:19.630 --> 03:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.969 --> 03:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
the next project is the Chillers
 
03:28:22.979 --> 03:28:24.469 align:start position:0%
the next project is the Chillers
um

03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the number on that one
 
03:28:30.769 --> 03:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:33.769 --> 03:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
and that project was delayed as a result
 
03:28:35.809 --> 03:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
of resource allocation to other
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
emergency projects but we do anticipate
 
03:28:41.290 --> 03:28:41.300 align:start position:0%
completion June 30th 2025
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
we did start the work and we anticipate
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
that balance being spent by that
 
03:28:52.729 --> 03:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
and then the next project is that nhh or
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital Renovations and I
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
don't have the project for that one
 
03:29:02.269 --> 03:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's 124.
 
03:29:02.279 --> 03:29:08.830 align:start position:0%
that's 124.
foreign

03:29:08.830 --> 03:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.670 --> 03:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
essentially additional Plumbing
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
mechanical and electrical work needed to
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
complete that project with a gold
 
03:29:21.670 --> 03:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.680 --> 03:29:24.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:29:24.010 --> 03:29:24.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:29:27.530 --> 03:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
and then the next one is the it's really
 
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Hospital campus security
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
or is it glencliffe
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
at glencliffe oh there's one for
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
Glencliff campus security glencliffe
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
number 119. thank you so 119 for
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
Glencliff campus security
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
that project was delayed but the plan
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
completion date is June 30th 2024.
 
03:29:48.290 --> 03:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
and then the the last project that we
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
have on our list is the Glencliff
 
03:29:50.340 --> 03:29:52.969 align:start position:0%
have on our list is the Glencliff
Electric

03:29:52.969 --> 03:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.969 --> 03:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
in its line 113.
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
and we anticipate that project to being
 
03:30:01.210 --> 03:30:01.220 align:start position:0%
completed June 30th 2024 in in
 
03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
leveraging the remaining funds on that
 
03:30:06.769 --> 03:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.769 --> 03:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
I am we we have a number of people here
 
03:30:11.570 --> 03:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
from the Department that if there's any
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
specific questions that we well one
 
03:30:15.050 --> 03:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
thing one thing I know I have a note
 
03:30:17.330 --> 03:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
here that the electronic visit
 
03:30:20.809 --> 03:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
verification is 90 Federal is this three
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar amount the general funds
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
or the total funds including the Federal
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you that is the total funds that
 
03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
including the federal funds oh so now we
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
only have 10 of that amount
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification you are
 
03:30:35.880 --> 03:30:40.929 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification you are
correct

03:30:40.929 --> 03:30:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:45.769 --> 03:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
so essentially the general fund
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
lapse would be closer to 371 thousand
 
03:30:52.800 --> 03:31:04.570 align:start position:0%
lapse would be closer to 371 thousand
dollars

03:31:04.570 --> 03:31:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's item 104 if everyone is
 
03:31:28.269 --> 03:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%

03:31:32.570 --> 03:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
um if I could could I just go through
 
03:31:35.330 --> 03:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
your worksheet and identify what for
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would be
 
03:31:39.769 --> 03:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
extended and then what would be lapsed
 
03:31:42.170 --> 03:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
just so we're clear is the numbers that
 
03:31:44.690 --> 03:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
need to be removed I'll go through the
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
notes that I have and if everyone can
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
cross-check me that would be great
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
so 101 stays 102 stays 103 stays 104
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
lapses although with a 90 smaller amount
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
than we thought
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
105 stays 106 stays 107 stays 108 stays

03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
as do I and if if for some reason Health

and Human Services identify something
 
03:34:06.530 --> 03:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
that should be different Dave will
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
and just one one more to add based off
 
03:34:18.849 --> 03:34:18.859 align:start position:0%
of your notification your
 
03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
noticing the electronic Visa
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
verification the the other project that
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
also is not full General funds on that
 
03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
list is the 114 mmis technical stack
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
upgrade which again that was a 90
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
so instead of it being
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
instead of it being 362 108 for General
 
03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
funding would be 36
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
210 or 211 dollars of laps
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.130 --> 03:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the uh
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
03:35:11.330 --> 03:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
so your note requesting uh
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
one million four hundred and thirty two
 
03:35:15.290 --> 03:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
thousand uh
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be uh taken out of the the big amount
 
03:35:22.010 --> 03:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we thought there was there is
 
03:35:27.889 --> 03:35:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
I will have to pull up the number to see
 
03:35:35.929 --> 03:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.650 --> 03:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
he's quicker with a spreadsheet than it
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
and do you and if I can and so do you
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
intend to try to uh use that money
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's that is existing there that is
 
03:35:50.809 --> 03:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
lapsing there to go towards the uh the
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
project that you uh wanted to put it
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.690 --> 03:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
yes we aren't able to do that without uh
 
03:36:02.090 --> 03:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
modifying HP 25.
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just asking what their intent
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
if I might as well I think that the
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
request from the Department which was
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
made last week as well is to fund this
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
project through repurposing
 
03:36:17.690 --> 03:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
um they were hoping to provide you know
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
most of it if they could but I think the
 
03:36:21.410 --> 03:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
request is still that the committee
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
consider this as a a part project to
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
repurposed funds too I'd also note that
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
the request last week was in the
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 1.8 million so they've
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.170 --> 03:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I will resubmit this to Mr Shea but
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
the based off of the calculations with
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent the total lapse that we
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
would be looking at is 617 660 dollars
 
03:36:56.330 --> 03:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
is what I've got on my spreadsheet but I
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
will verify that and send it back to Mr
 
03:37:06.889 --> 03:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.969 --> 03:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
an erupting human
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on the subject system for
 
03:37:27.849 --> 03:37:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.170 --> 03:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
hello for the record my name is Todd
 
03:37:32.090 --> 03:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
Bickford I am the executive director of
 
03:37:33.650 --> 03:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
glencliffe home
 
03:37:37.010 --> 03:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you nice to see you yes is that
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
going to be a new system or a
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
replacement it's going to be a
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
replacement system the system we have is
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
a very Antiquated and doesn't meet the
 
03:37:48.050 --> 03:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
current Des standards and eyes on the
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
verge of collapse which would add much
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
additional costs
 
03:37:55.130 --> 03:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay we saw the pictures that were
 
03:37:55.140 --> 03:37:56.570 align:start position:0%
okay we saw the pictures that were
dramatic

03:37:56.570 --> 03:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and and I had asked last week also if
 
03:38:01.729 --> 03:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
whoever was going to be doing the work
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
was familiar with the location of Glenn
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
Cliff I guess going back at least at
 
03:38:10.250 --> 03:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
least one biennium I had spoken with
 
03:38:13.130 --> 03:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner shibanat and because there
 
03:38:15.170 --> 03:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
was concern that people were doing work
 
03:38:17.570 --> 03:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
bidding on projects but weren't familiar
 
03:38:18.729 --> 03:38:18.739 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
rural ruralness of your location and
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
that was a problem so um she was making
 
03:38:27.530 --> 03:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
sure that people were familiar with the
 
03:38:30.849 --> 03:38:30.859 align:start position:0%
situation when they bid yes that's a a
 
03:38:33.889 --> 03:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
comment over the past years issue um
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
people from out of state bidding on
 
03:38:36.650 --> 03:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
something and then realizing where we're
 
03:38:39.170 --> 03:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
located right we do have a couple of
 
03:38:42.290 --> 03:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
vendors that frequently do projects for
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
us that we would make sure that they're
 
03:38:45.769 --> 03:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
aware of any uh our feet have put out
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
and in addition we've worked with Public
 
03:38:51.050 --> 03:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
Works to insist on a mandatory site
 
03:38:54.769 --> 03:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
visit before the bids you know largely
 
03:38:57.170 --> 03:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
just so that they realize how remote we
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
are right and just just one more on the
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
Windows you might not be the window
 
03:39:04.370 --> 03:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
person but all of the the windows now in
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Lamont section
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
everything is in and yes nothing is
 
03:39:11.210 --> 03:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
wonderful this this winter was much
 
03:39:13.610 --> 03:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
warmer for the rest nothing blew in
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
nothing fell on the residence it was a a
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
very successful project that the staff
 
03:39:24.530 --> 03:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
Jim if I could one quick question please
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
the uh the wastewater treatment
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
facility when do you want to begin on
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
this we hope to help start this spring
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we the number went
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
down from 1.8 to 1.4 and change is that
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
Des has some Arbor funds that they're
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
able to provide us as well to make up
 
03:39:48.590 --> 03:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
that difference and we need to have that
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
encumbered I Believe by June 30th to get
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
that from them and then the project
 
03:39:55.190 --> 03:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
would start either this summer or in the
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
fall somewhere do we have you have bids
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
in hand we should not have bids in hand
 
03:40:04.729 --> 03:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
but we do have in hand is the design and
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
plans we had done a capital project I
 
03:40:11.090 --> 03:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
want to guess six years ago to design a
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
new dementia wing and part of that
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
project included having Engineers look
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
at our current student system then to
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade it for additional capacity so
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've pulled those out of the out of
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
those plans and just having an engineer
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
review them and restamp them and that
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
should be completed within a week or so
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything further from anyone
 
03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
on this particular project we just that
 
03:40:43.849 --> 03:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about with the sewage
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
can you um do this somewhat modularly I
 
03:40:48.530 --> 03:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
mean there's different components to it
 
03:40:50.090 --> 03:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
so if you get a certain amount of money
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
you might be able to do a portion of it
 
03:40:52.380 --> 03:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
you might be able to do a portion of it
or

03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:40:55.330 --> 03:40:55.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
not being an engineer I believe we could
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:08.030 --> 03:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
and representative Juris thank you just
 
03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:09.710 align:start position:0%
and representative Juris thank you just
briefly

03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
so what's the drainage
 
03:41:14.929 --> 03:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
like now
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
very poor out of the four beds two are
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
still functioning and they take three
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
times as long as they should to drain
 
03:41:26.929 --> 03:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
and those are the ones we're concerned
 
03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
about overflowing I assume you guys saw
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
the council saw the pictures last week a
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
couple of beds are very overgrown the
 
03:41:38.809 --> 03:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
other beds are not in much better shape
 
03:41:42.650 --> 03:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay so so just your fear of draining I
 
03:41:45.290 --> 03:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
mean sinks bathrooms
 
03:41:47.929 --> 03:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
everything goes to those fields flowing
 
03:41:47.939 --> 03:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
everything goes to those fields flowing
slowly

03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
training slowly oh no fortunately we're
 
03:41:53.150 --> 03:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
built on the side of the Hill
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
um so there's still plenty of
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
suction uh gravity suction down to to
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
the current system so it's not backing
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you thank you
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay anything further
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right if you could stay for just one
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
minute after we're done I have something
 
03:42:13.010 --> 03:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
I want to raise
 
03:42:17.769 --> 03:42:17.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
our our next agency is at two o'clock so
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be in recess until then and it
 
04:05:14.210 --> 04:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.010 --> 04:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
I will call the committee back from
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
Recess this is the Department of
 
04:05:19.380 --> 04:05:20.750 align:start position:0%
Recess this is the Department of
military

04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
military
 
04:05:22.729 --> 04:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
and we have Warren Perry the Deputy
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and Judy Chen the Chief
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer
 
04:05:29.210 --> 04:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
please feel free to say whatever you'd
 
04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:05:35.450 --> 04:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Mr chair thank you for
 
04:05:36.650 --> 04:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify members of
 
04:05:37.969 --> 04:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
the committee so we're happy to be here
 
04:05:41.809 --> 04:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
we provided a letter dated March 13th uh
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
signed by uh the adjutant general that
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
kind of goes over those uh those items
 
04:05:49.849 --> 04:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
which we are asking for a lapse
 
04:05:52.490 --> 04:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
extension for most of them are 100
 
04:05:54.889 --> 04:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
federally funded uh and those things
 
04:05:56.450 --> 04:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
that have General funds attached to them
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't amount to a lot of money and I
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
know that's our interest is to kind of
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
scrape back some of the money we can for
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
the general funds uh our intent is to uh
 
04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
to do two things here today is keep all
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
of those things that uh we we would ask
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
to have a lab extension for and we'll go
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
through them and I'll answer any
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions you have on any of those and
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
then on page three of that letter you
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
can see the things that we will lapse in
 
04:06:20.929 --> 04:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of General funds and
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we intend to lapse
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
for this particular uh this particular
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget also I think that Mr Shea passed
 
04:06:31.490 --> 04:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
out an addendum where we would like to
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
address one change to item
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
7166 and that you'll find that on the
 
04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
bottom of page three and we just want to
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
repurpose that money into another
 
04:06:43.319 --> 04:06:44.530 align:start position:0%
repurpose that money into another
project

04:06:44.530 --> 04:06:44.540 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:06:47.809 --> 04:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll I think I'll start there one
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that happened at the end
 
04:06:51.370 --> 04:06:51.380 align:start position:0%
of kovid was the Federal Government
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
waived the state match for some of their
 
04:06:55.610 --> 04:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
federally funded projects
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
and in that time we used that 100
 
04:07:00.650 --> 04:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
federally money that would have been
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
used where we would had to have used we
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
would have had to have used some general
 
04:07:07.010 --> 04:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
funds to take care of some things and
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
now what we'd like to do is take that
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation and roll it over into
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
other projects uh
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
so it's about uh eight hundred and
 
04:07:17.809 --> 04:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollars
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh and you could see that the current on
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
the top of that addendum that Mr Shea
 
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
passed out the current language that's
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the budget and what we would like to
 
04:07:26.929 --> 04:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
change it to
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
essentially it's anti-terrorism Force
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
protection standards and some of the uh
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
some of the damage and decaying parts of
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
our buildings that are just aging that
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
we can keep the general upkeep we
 
04:07:41.090 --> 04:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we'll get that done at
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
the end of next summer so about 18
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
so if so that's for the addendum piece
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the other the other items you can see
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
that those are all part of the HP HP 25
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
in uh the 23 20 uh 22 23 budget
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
uh the anti-terrorism force protection
 
04:08:06.170 --> 04:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
pieces that were working at the Edward
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
cross training center in Pembroke uh and
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
stationing of the Regional Training
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
Institute with that project is underway
 
04:08:15.769 --> 04:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
print it's it's the design is probably
 
04:08:17.210 --> 04:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
pretty close to done
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're pending some federal project
 
04:08:21.050 --> 04:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
approval 100 General funds to make that
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
happen it's about 1.6 million dollars
 
04:08:28.849 --> 04:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
nine three two nine uh energy resiliency
 
04:08:31.729 --> 04:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
and efficiency this is a real important
 
04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
piece to us right now based on what's
 
04:08:35.150 --> 04:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
happening in terms of keeping the lights
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
and heat on and the cost of energy
 
04:08:40.969 --> 04:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
uh again we anticipate the fall of 24
 
04:08:42.889 --> 04:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
completing that project
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
pending the federal government's
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
approval again 100 General funds
 
04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Grafton County field maintenance
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
shop this is going to be in Littleton
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
the milcon was approved
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
for FY Federal fiscal year 24 we
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate completing that project in
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
the fall of 26 about 13 million dollars
 
04:09:01.969 --> 04:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
almost 14 million dollars in federal
 
04:09:01.979 --> 04:09:03.469 align:start position:0%
almost 14 million dollars in federal
money

04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
number 9331 minor military Construction
 
04:09:08.570 --> 04:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
in kowas County
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
right so about nine million dollars in
 
04:09:17.929 --> 04:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
construction and that's based on a
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
congressional earmark that we received
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
in this year's ndaa
 
04:09:24.050 --> 04:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's the and it's going to be to
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
specifically to create a training
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
facility for power management for our
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
aviators in the White Mountains so this
 
04:09:30.239 --> 04:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
aviators in the White Mountains so this
is

04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
training Pilots to fly and the
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
conditions in the White Mountains it
 
04:09:37.010 --> 04:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
really is a training facility but there
 
04:09:38.570 --> 04:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
is some there's some free chicken here
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the state as we will be able to
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
operate a little bit better in terms of
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
our uh search and rescue and the things
 
04:09:45.530 --> 04:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
that we do to help people that are hurt
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
or or lost in the White Mountains so we
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
do a lot of that we save the state a lot
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
of money the federal government
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
subsidizes that as training so we're
 
04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
able to save a lot of lives but a
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
relatively important project about
 
04:10:00.110 --> 04:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
training power management and uh and
 
04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
helping also with the state
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
with the state search and rescue
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%

04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
Please Mr Mr chair uh I this isn't a
 
04:10:20.210 --> 04:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
question I just want to let the the
 
04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
newer members of the committee know this
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
because we've been having struggling
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
with this all day long
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
their presentation and their numbers are
 
04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
in the exact order that we have them in
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
our capital budget in other words we're
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
on the Stratford County military
 
04:10:40.130 --> 04:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
construction if you go down to number
 
04:10:40.140 --> 04:10:40.969 align:start position:0%
construction if you go down to number
um

04:10:40.969 --> 04:10:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:40.979 --> 04:10:43.849 align:start position:0%
um
149

04:10:43.849 --> 04:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
149
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
on our sheet their next one
 
04:10:49.490 --> 04:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
Warehouse facility upgrades will be 150
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're at if you're
 
04:10:53.150 --> 04:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
trying to cross-reference their their
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
version with ours thank you
 
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
will they go in numerical sequence the
 
04:11:00.050 --> 04:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
rest of the way through so yes so the
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center for renovation
 
04:11:06.370 --> 04:11:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
yes correct alts number 150 I'll try to
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
everybody comes in with a different
 
04:11:19.130 --> 04:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
version so we've got to figure out how
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
it matches to our version and again
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
easier to follow I apologize I've had I
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
known those numbers I would have just
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
those red uh so we were at uh 151 151 so
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
just allow for renovation alterations
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
the critical components of Reading
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
Center Statewide again most of our
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in terms of our Arena
 
04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
centers aging and this just helps us
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
continue to keep that stuff serviceable
 
04:11:46.969 --> 04:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
so we have good serviceable facilities
 
04:11:48.290 --> 04:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
for our the members of the New Hampshire
 
04:11:51.290 --> 04:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
National Guard that is uh a 50 50
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
project 50 Federal 50 General funds uh
 
04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
these will replace a a boiler uh in
 
04:12:01.250 --> 04:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
building F on the state military
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
registry reservation and the flooring in
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Manchester arena center which is uh
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh an aging facility but very useful to
 
04:12:10.199 --> 04:12:10.910 align:start position:0%
uh an aging facility but very useful to
us

04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's only about 650 000 left on that
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
encumbrance we anticipate in the summer
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
of 24 we'll be able to complete that one
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
152 is a is land
 
04:12:23.689 --> 04:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
everything uh that the state does with
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
regard to building facilities and
 
04:12:28.610 --> 04:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
federal funding for facilities is uh
 
04:12:30.650 --> 04:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
contingent on the state purchasing the
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
land to do so so this uh
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
this appropriation of five hundred
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we anticipate
 
04:12:40.969 --> 04:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
hopefully spending soon uh is to buy
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
land so that we can continue to build
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
new or uh have areas for our National
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.729 --> 04:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
the land is 152 I thought
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
did I get the number right 152 yep
 
04:12:59.689 --> 04:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.699 --> 04:13:02.330 align:start position:0%
 
153

04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
153
 
04:13:05.290 --> 04:13:05.300 align:start position:0%
energy resiliency and uh
 
04:13:07.610 --> 04:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh efficiency improvements in our
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
Readiness centers
 
04:13:11.150 --> 04:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would be lost on you
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
if I if I told you how much more energy
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
cost this year than it did uh last year
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
so this will help us kind of defray some
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
of the anticipated costs of of energy
 
04:13:23.929 --> 04:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
just at peas and it won't necessarily
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
apply to this item but I could share
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we're paying about 285
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
000 a month to keep the lights and heat
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
on at peas
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
so PCR National Guard base it's not
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
again it's operating budget stuff so any
 
04:13:38.769 --> 04:13:38.779 align:start position:0%
any money that we have to continue to
 
04:13:41.330 --> 04:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
provide efficiencies will save us some
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
money in the long run and the payback
 
04:13:45.769 --> 04:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
period on 800 800 000 that 800 000 won't
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
be very long at all if you think about
 
04:13:51.410 --> 04:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
again land for military construction uh
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
that would be 154. Statewide acquisition
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
of lands
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
in the fall of uh
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh 23 we anticipate that again we're
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
looking at Parcels in Manchester Salem
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
and Concord as well as Pembroke right
 
04:14:09.410 --> 04:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
now we're working through the you know
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's worth us making an
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
offer in Pembroke on two Parcels of land
 
04:14:15.650 --> 04:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
owned by the utilities companies so
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's some of the things and there's
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
526 thousand dollars left on that
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation initially the next page
 
04:14:22.560 --> 04:14:24.469 align:start position:0%
appropriation initially the next page
154

04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
154
 
04:14:26.570 --> 04:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 155
 
04:14:29.450 --> 04:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought my uh administrator
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
Finance I can't count generally so make
 
04:14:35.689 --> 04:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
sure we get that right interrupt
 
04:14:35.699 --> 04:14:36.650 align:start position:0%
sure we get that right interrupt
please

04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
yes I I might have been mistaken at some
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
point in time I think we went off the
 
04:14:44.030 --> 04:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
tracks 154 which we just did land for
 
04:14:46.130 --> 04:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
military construction on our sheet is
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
for the Concord Aviation Residence Inn
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.250 --> 04:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
why don't you just go ahead and order
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
you're going and I'll figure and I'll
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
figure out the numbers later okay
 
04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
again sir I apologize for the confusion
 
04:15:10.010 --> 04:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
right so we'll talk about hazardous
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
hazard remediation that's where I'm at
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
top of Page Three
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
and that you're that's your number 156
 
04:15:20.210 --> 04:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's we may be out of order with
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
you now right we're at absolutely out of
 
04:15:24.359 --> 04:15:25.130 align:start position:0%
you now right we're at absolutely out of
work

04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
yep so we're out of we're out of order I
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
apologize we're I'm just going to keep
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
calling the title off and I'll pause so
 
04:15:32.090 --> 04:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
you can find the appropriate place in
 
04:15:35.570 --> 04:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
again this is uh we had some uh we there
 
04:15:41.090 --> 04:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
were some existing soil that had may
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
have had some contamination on it so
 
04:15:46.130 --> 04:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
what when we uh the reason this is we're
 
04:15:48.889 --> 04:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
asking for the extension here is when uh
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
from 19 is when covid hit we were we
 
04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
kind of ceased all spending on capital
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
projects to determine whether or not
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to reallocate money
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
so this this project got set aside for a
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
little while now that we have the
 
04:16:04.490 --> 04:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
authority to spend the money we're re
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're bringing this back up to the top
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to keep these General funds
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can do this hazardous
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
remediation on the land so there were
 
04:16:13.849 --> 04:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
some uh some lead contamination based on
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
what was before we owned the land a
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
makeshift firing range people with
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
sandpit that people would go shoot on we
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
just need to go do the remediation if
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
there is any uh any pieces there the
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
next the next project that I have is
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
Aviation Readiness Center and that's the
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh we anticipate here in the spring
 
04:16:33.769 --> 04:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to close this
 
04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
project out adjacent to our Aviation
 
04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
facility we built a new Readiness Center
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the aviation units uh there's only
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
about 28 000 left on this and we're just
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
working through the uh the process with
 
04:16:48.290 --> 04:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
DPW to close out that project and make
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
sure there are no outstanding
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
contractual obligations with regard to
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
that project
 
04:16:54.530 --> 04:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
the next project I have is federal and
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide repairs and upgrades
 
04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
this would be csms Renovations under
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
construction in Manchester so that's the
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's a maintenance shop
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh and a copper a
 
04:17:09.550 --> 04:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
cyber security
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
facility for our cyber security
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
organization in Concord
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh about four or five million dollars
 
04:17:18.769 --> 04:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
left on that 15 million dollar
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's 100 federal funds we
 
04:17:23.090 --> 04:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
anticipate in the win you know next
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
winter we'll have that complete
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
those are two pretty important projects
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
that cyber security one particularly so
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know the National
 
04:17:32.809 --> 04:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
Guard has a cyber security unit cyber
 
04:17:35.450 --> 04:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
warfare unit uh they're activated quite
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
often uh to go uh do both offensive and
 
04:17:41.210 --> 04:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
defensive operations in the Cyber sphere
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
of things so they're doing great work
 
04:17:44.929 --> 04:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty important
 
04:17:47.809 --> 04:17:47.819 align:start position:0%
domain right now
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're pretty good
 
04:17:52.130 --> 04:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
I I don't know exactly what they do I
 
04:17:53.809 --> 04:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
mean I could if I went and asked but I
 
04:17:55.849 --> 04:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
prefer to be blissfully ignorant but
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide minor military construction
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.819 --> 04:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
yep funny requested design and construct
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
a maintenance shop in Littleton
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
the design is underway construction is
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be awarded in September
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.929 --> 04:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
Manchester anti-terrorism and force
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
protection that's one of the ones that I
 
04:18:32.150 --> 04:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that was uh
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
funded 100 federally instead of the 50
 
04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
50 that you see here on the shop so that
 
04:18:40.610 --> 04:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
that 890 000 that remains we want to
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
repurpose and that would be the the that
 
04:18:46.610 --> 04:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
addendum that uh that we made that I I
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
spoke about at the beginning of my
 
04:18:47.760 --> 04:18:50.450 align:start position:0%
spoke about at the beginning of my
testimony

04:18:50.450 --> 04:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Readiness design
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center design
 
04:18:57.969 --> 04:18:57.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
we think the design is going to happen
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
in this Federal fiscal year and
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
construction will begin in 25 uh I
 
04:19:07.010 --> 04:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
believe this is the the Plymouth
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center that uh they're going
 
04:19:11.330 --> 04:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
to be working to to be done but this is
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
the design piece of that
 
04:19:16.490 --> 04:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
so that's in terms of what's there that
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
we'd like to extend the lapse that's
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
that completes that part of my testimony
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you go to page the next page
 
04:19:22.260 --> 04:19:23.689 align:start position:0%
if you go to page the next page
uh

04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:26.090 --> 04:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
there was uh
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh almost two million dollars I'm
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
guessing that uh that we're happy to
 
04:19:34.610 --> 04:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
lapse back and of that
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand dollars are
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.110 --> 04:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that concludes
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.849 --> 04:19:51.859 align:start position:0%
so can we just cover so it's 1 167
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
that you would like to repurpose
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 157
 
04:19:59.330 --> 04:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know which number which number
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
is Manchester any terrorism Force
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
protection Renovations that is correct
 
04:20:05.210 --> 04:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
sir uh is the one you'd like to
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
repurpose along the lines of what's on
 
04:20:09.650 --> 04:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
this sheet here or the second sheet yes
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
so for the committee following Along on
 
04:20:20.570 --> 04:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
our worksheet of 157 has the old
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
verbiage of what he wanted
 
04:20:25.140 --> 04:20:26.570 align:start position:0%
verbiage of what he wanted
and

04:20:26.570 --> 04:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.189 --> 04:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
and just to be precise representative if
 
04:20:35.929 --> 04:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
you don't mind the top part of the
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
handout is the current 157. the bottom
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.479 --> 04:20:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
only

04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
Orson Newman
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um back to peas and the
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
energy did you say 275
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
000 a month
 
04:20:58.250 --> 04:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
I I said I may have said 288 but it's
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's been averaging over 280 000 a month
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the last three months so the
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour rate went from about up uh
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I don't I wish I had brought my
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
sheet maybe I did oh I did look at this
 
04:21:16.729 --> 04:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
so in in June of 21 the kilowatt hour
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
rate was about seven and a half cents
 
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
seven seven point six cents at a
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
in February of 23 the rate was 48 cents
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
so usage went down and about a six-fold
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
increase in the kilowatt hour usage and
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
most of that was in transmission I'm
 
04:21:35.640 --> 04:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
most of that was in transmission I'm
guessing

04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
04:21:40.130 --> 04:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that the rate for March is
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to be about 32 cents and then by
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
June back down to about 15 cents an hour
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
so our our usage rates in terms of
 
04:21:50.809 --> 04:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours are you know just for
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
comparison in June of 21 in that month
 
04:21:55.370 --> 04:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
we used 587
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
000 kilowatt hours
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
and in February we used uh well let's
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
let's use April of 20 uh hold on let me
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
give you a better number
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
in October of 22 we used 482
 
04:22:11.450 --> 04:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
but so our rates are staying pretty much
 
04:22:14.450 --> 04:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
the same within about 40 000 kilowatt
 
04:22:15.889 --> 04:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
hours a month this is probably the
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
standard deviation of that but to
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour rate is just it sixth
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
honest it went six times more so we
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that'll go back down as
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
we go closer to the summer and we should
 
04:22:29.450 --> 04:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
be back to more reasonable times we
 
04:22:29.460 --> 04:22:31.670 align:start position:0%
be back to more reasonable times we
anticipate

04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
for March for April about 140 000 bill
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
so a little a little less than half
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
told any ability for any solar array or
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
have you looked into that so as a matter
 
04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
of fact I met with the engine you know
 
04:22:51.769 --> 04:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not an unusual question
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative so I thank you for it so
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we got yesterday in
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
the operating budget hearing was hey
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
have you thought about LEDs and every
 
04:23:00.769 --> 04:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
time my light burns out we put LEDs in
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
so there are you know we we're doing the
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
very very best to to to to to save as
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
much energy as we can I can't speak to
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
solar but I would tell you probably the
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
installation of solar at this point for
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be almost cost prohibitive in the
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
short term and I don't know what the
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
payback period would be it sure would be
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
nice if we could all live in the green
 
04:23:22.969 --> 04:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
world I I I'm not arguing that at all
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
but it's tough I mean and they have a
 
04:23:27.170 --> 04:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
they have a pretty tough mission that I
 
04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
think really what's driving this
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
increase in cost is the cost of
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
electricity mostly transmission so
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
what's the current status of the
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
proposal to redo the hangar you actually
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
have funds here
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
that are not carried are you are you at
 
04:23:50.450 --> 04:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
all advancing that project is it dead in
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
the water
 
04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
which which project well there was there
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
was in previous bienniums the ability I
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
know exactly what you're talking about
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
reconstruct the hangar at the airport
 
04:24:04.610 --> 04:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
across the street so uh so that project
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
is based on so here let me give you a
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
little example of a little context of
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
what happened I understand your question
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so in the last
 
04:24:15.130 --> 04:24:15.140 align:start position:0%
biennium we asked for an appropriation
 
04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
to con construct a joint hanger with the
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety so that we could
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
house both our Aviation assets and safe
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Department safeties uh specifically the
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
state police hanger co-located
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
as we went through the design part of
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
the project the design requirements for
 
04:24:35.210 --> 04:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
the fire suppression systems for the
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal government were different than
 
04:24:39.170 --> 04:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
the state and frankly the federal
 
04:24:41.570 --> 04:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
government's requirements were cost
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitive right so this department of
 
04:24:44.929 --> 04:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
safety would not have been able to
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
afford this and we wouldn't have been
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
able to afford it based on the cost of
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
the fire suppression systems so when we
 
04:24:53.570 --> 04:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
realized that and we realized that there
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
was no way for us to be able to conduct
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
this Hangar joint construct this anger
 
04:24:59.210 --> 04:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
jointly we came back to the committee
 
04:25:00.889 --> 04:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
and asked for a rewrite a halfway
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
through the biennium to give the state
 
04:25:05.929 --> 04:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
police or the department of safety back
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
their portion of that construction money
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
and we did that so we reallocated about
 
04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
two million dollars back to the
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety so that they could
 
04:25:16.370 --> 04:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
build their own facility and not be
 
04:25:18.170 --> 04:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
waiting on the federal government to
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
fund the other half
 
04:25:22.610 --> 04:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
as far as I know I'm not going to speak
 
04:25:25.070 --> 04:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Safety but in our
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department of
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
Safety their their intent is to
 
04:25:29.929 --> 04:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
refurbish their current facility not to
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
construct a new one that's my
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
understanding again I can't speak for
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
from our perspective
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
the construction of the military part of
 
04:25:42.050 --> 04:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
that Hangar is on hold until we get to
 
04:25:44.689 --> 04:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
get the funding issue
 
04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's a long explanation but I wanted to
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.649 --> 04:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
I could share thank you sorry
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Juris thank you
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
you've got some money budgeted for
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
resiliency and efficiency improvements
 
04:26:10.330 --> 04:26:10.340 align:start position:0%
of 800 000 and you mentioned earlier
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
appease so is any of that going into
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
Renewables or is that just
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
um efficiencies for heating or or
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
replacement of like a lot you know
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
lighting or other electronics so if
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the most
 
04:26:29.809 --> 04:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
of that I mean actually all of that will
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
go to the Army side not at peace and
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be focused on things like roofs
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
heating Windows efficient Windows
 
04:26:40.130 --> 04:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
efficient uh uh HVAC systems heating
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
systems boilers but none of it will go
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
to peas their funding streams are a
 
04:26:46.010 --> 04:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
little bit different at peace most of
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
their construction is 100 you know it's
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
taken it's federally done not it's not
 
04:26:52.490 --> 04:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
done through the state budget
 
04:26:52.500 --> 04:26:53.809 align:start position:0%
done through the state budget
okay

04:26:53.809 --> 04:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
and just one more land acquisition you
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
budgeted you elapsing it is that
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
have you gotten any prices from the
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
landowners that you will butt
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we we continue to look for land uh
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
avara Butters and one of them or
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
actually there are two Parcels in
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
Pembroke that about us that are owned by
 
04:27:18.290 --> 04:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
eversource and Unitil I believe
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a kind of handshake
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
negotiated kind of price for one of the
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
parcels in uh in Pembroke and I believe
 
04:27:29.210 --> 04:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's 140
 
04:27:31.130 --> 04:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
000 I believe something close to that
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
for that that's I don't know the acreage
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have it off the top of
 
04:27:37.969 --> 04:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
my head uh but that's that's the one
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
price that we have right now land right
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
now is really hard to find I mean we're
 
04:27:46.330 --> 04:27:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
if I could expand on that answer uh the
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
reason why we have a land appropriation
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
is not because we want to buy a specific
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
parcel of a land that has been
 
04:27:54.960 --> 04:27:56.210 align:start position:0%
parcel of a land that has been
identified

04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
identified
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have a land
 
04:28:00.110 --> 04:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation and Carry It Forward is to
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
be able to purchase land if and when
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's needed the reason for that is
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes the federal government any any
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
military and I'm sure you'll correct me
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
if I don't have this quite right any
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
military construction has to be on state
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
land that they do
 
04:28:15.239 --> 04:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
land that they do
and

04:28:17.110 --> 04:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot use federal funds to buy that
 
04:28:23.809 --> 04:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
land so we have land appropriation in
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
reserve so that when they come and say
 
04:28:28.969 --> 04:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
we'd like to build a Readiness Center in
 
04:28:31.490 --> 04:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
this area they have the ability they
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
have the funds to buy land to put it on
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
without having to wait for an
 
04:28:37.490 --> 04:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
appropriation cycle after which they
 
04:28:39.889 --> 04:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
will have lost the federal funding that
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
they were offered do I have that about
 
04:28:41.640 --> 04:28:42.649 align:start position:0%
they were offered do I have that about
right

04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's very correct for the Army side peas
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different but it's
 
04:28:53.689 --> 04:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.699 --> 04:28:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
think it's more than pre-approval for
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
by that uh
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
though that wraps it up thank you
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
any anyone else
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
apparently no
 
04:29:16.610 --> 04:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much thank
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time I'm happy to
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we're we're expecting an agency at 2
 
04:30:18.590 --> 04:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
30 that is not here yet so we'll be in a
 
04:32:39.530 --> 04:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.130 --> 04:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
it being 230 we welcome the Department

and

04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:52.189 --> 04:32:52.199 align:start position:0%

um and if I just lead off of the just a
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
brief statement and then we can
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
discuss I appreciate that
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
as you're aware at dncr we currently
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
manage a number of capital projects
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
funded with capital Appropriations
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
awarded to us through this and the prior
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
biennium approved budgets
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
at this time we currently have 13 open
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
accounts containing Capital
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations which is listed on pages
 
04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
13 14 of the governor's capital budget
 
04:33:40.260 --> 04:33:41.929 align:start position:0%
13 14 of the governor's capital budget
requests

04:33:41.929 --> 04:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
requests
 
04:33:43.970 --> 04:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
that we have requested to be carried
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
forward for use in the 24-25 biennium as
 
04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
we move forward to complete the projects
 
04:33:50.209 --> 04:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
for which the Appropriations have been
 
04:33:50.219 --> 04:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
for which the Appropriations have been
provided

04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
for some accounts progress on a small
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
number of these projects and thus use of
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
the funding has been delayed a reason
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
such as refocus of priorities and
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
redirecting of work resources
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
particularly during the 2021 biennium in
 
04:34:06.051 --> 04:34:06.061 align:start position:0%
response to the demands brought on by
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
the covid pandemic for example or in the
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
recent biennium matters of logistics
 
04:34:12.769 --> 04:34:12.779 align:start position:0%
such as needed planning changes and
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
other on-site matters which require
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
preliminary work efforts before Capital
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure work can begin have
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
delayed use of the funds however we have
 
04:34:23.449 --> 04:34:23.459 align:start position:0%
been able to proceed with much of what
 
04:34:25.490 --> 04:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
has been budgeted and several are fully
 
04:34:27.170 --> 04:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
encumbered and or very close to
 
04:34:27.180 --> 04:34:28.429 align:start position:0%
encumbered and or very close to
completion

04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
completion
 
04:34:29.810 --> 04:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're eager to move forward with
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
completion of all of the efforts for
 
04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
which we have been approved for funding
 
04:34:35.090 --> 04:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
and to that end request at this time to
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
be allowed to carry these funds as
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
listed forward into the new biennial
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:34:40.561 --> 04:34:42.189 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
questions

04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
there was one the uh
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
Communication System replacement letter
 
04:34:49.849 --> 04:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
G you wanted to have added do I
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
understand that yes there was a
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of an old Communication
 
04:34:57.609 --> 04:34:57.619 align:start position:0%
System replacement
 
04:35:00.769 --> 04:35:00.779 align:start position:0%
fund that still had eighteen hundred
 
04:35:03.369 --> 04:35:03.379 align:start position:0%
dollars outstanding
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
we wanted to and originally we thought
 
04:35:08.209 --> 04:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
that should lapse
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
um because we had the new funding to
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
complete the rest of the project but we
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
found that it would be wise for us to
 
04:35:16.490 --> 04:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and combine the remaining
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
eighteen hundred dollars with the
 
04:35:21.410 --> 04:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
existing uh more recent funding for that
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
program uh until it is until it's fully
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
expended so with your permission we'd
 
04:35:28.131 --> 04:35:28.141 align:start position:0%
like to to retain that
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
all right so for the committee we're
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
working on lines 161 through
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
173 and after line 168 there is from
 
04:35:39.529 --> 04:35:39.539 align:start position:0%
2019 letter G Communication System
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
replacement that's what we're discussing
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they would like to add that as a
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:51.840 --> 04:35:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:35:54.650 --> 04:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
that is in particular was not on the
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
list originally so we'd like to add that
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of what was listed
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
again we'd like to retain
 
04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
all of the items uh that are that are
 
04:36:06.061 --> 04:36:07.131 align:start position:0%
all of the items uh that are that are
listed

04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:07.141 align:start position:0%
listed
 
04:36:08.449 --> 04:36:08.459 align:start position:0%
um and we're happy to answer any
 
04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
questions or clarify any concerns that
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
may exist as a result of of these
 
04:36:13.561 --> 04:36:18.709 align:start position:0%
may exist as a result of of these
requests

04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
oh see none uh was there anything else
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
you'd want to say I don't think there
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
would be any problem with
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
with any of this
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
um no we have nothing to add at this
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
time as long as there are no questions
 
04:36:32.449 --> 04:36:32.459 align:start position:0%
where we appreciate that well thank you
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
for coming it's always a pleasure to see
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
since we're off of this uh to go back to
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
your last present
 
04:36:46.369 --> 04:36:46.379 align:start position:0%
excuse me last presentation
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
we talked about excavators
 
04:36:48.959 --> 04:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
we talked about excavators
and

04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:53.330 --> 04:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
you folks had mentioned how difficult it
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
is to go through the Rental process
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming those who are and I'm
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
guessing but I've talked to a couple
 
04:37:02.689 --> 04:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
other folks that it's Hoops that are put
 
04:37:04.609 --> 04:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
in place by administrative Services I
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
believe to how you have to go about it
 
04:37:06.600 --> 04:37:07.551 align:start position:0%
believe to how you have to go about it
or

04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of calling up and
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
getting the item delivered it's the
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
preliminary hoops
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of procurement process yes
 
04:37:18.650 --> 04:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
the The Authority that is granted uh for
 
04:37:20.570 --> 04:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
us to pursue rental equipment agreements
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
short-term rental equipment agreements
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
isn't is advantageous for us to have
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
however the procurement limitations that
 
04:37:29.929 --> 04:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
are typically still applicable that is
 
04:37:34.631 --> 04:37:34.641 align:start position:0%
posting bids going to governing Council
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
following limitations on dollar amounts
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
and so forth is a very time consuming
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
process and much of what we do with
 
04:37:43.490 --> 04:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
rental equipment agreements is typically
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
in response to very immediate needs in
 
04:37:49.131 --> 04:37:49.141 align:start position:0%
the field so that really has been the
 
04:37:51.769 --> 04:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
the big the challenge so my ask to you
 
04:37:51.779 --> 04:37:54.349 align:start position:0%
the big the challenge so my ask to you
is

04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:37:54.359 --> 04:37:55.429 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
Commissioners should be able to
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
administer their department and their
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
budget without a whole lot of
 
04:38:02.449 --> 04:38:02.459 align:start position:0%
interference any chance you folks could
 
04:38:04.490 --> 04:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
come up with some language that would
 
04:38:07.131 --> 04:38:07.141 align:start position:0%
streamline and expedite the process for
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
emergency situations when you need
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
something yesterday that we could insert
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
the language in that'll bypass all these
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
other Hoops I could certainly talk to
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the members of the
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
respective bureaus and divisions and and
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
are looking behind you that there might
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
be some oh
 
04:38:28.439 --> 04:38:38.330 align:start position:0%
be some oh
foreign

04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
to your request uh representative Eaton
 
04:38:43.250 --> 04:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the operating in the capital budgets
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
you can't put statuary statutory changes
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
in so that would be a house bill 2
 
04:38:49.730 --> 04:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
amendment that they would potentially
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
need if they were going to suspend a law
 
04:38:53.769 --> 04:38:53.779 align:start position:0%
that requires certain
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
procedures occur in order to obtain uh
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the equipment that we're discussing so
 
04:38:59.570 --> 04:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
they could still come up with the
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
language you just wouldn't be able to
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
put it in House Bill 25 it would have to
 
04:39:05.051 --> 04:39:05.061 align:start position:0%
go into House Bill 2 or some other
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and they're done that no
 
04:39:08.929 --> 04:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
right where to put it and who to get it
 
04:39:08.939 --> 04:39:10.250 align:start position:0%
right where to put it and who to get it
done

04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
just need the language very well I will
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
definitely follow up with the committee
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.051 --> 04:39:33.061 align:start position:0%
if I look at items 161 here and I
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
believe you're talking about Community
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
communication systems replacement and
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
there was some monies left in there how
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
many how many
 
04:39:41.958 --> 04:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
many how many
properties

04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
properties
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
do you do you control with uh
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
Towers communication and so forth
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
we have a approximately 20 communication
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
sites that this applies to that we're
 
04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
upgrading the equipment and we break it
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
down into the North Region and the South
 
04:40:07.330 --> 04:40:07.340 align:start position:0%
part of the states
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
roughly evenly split okay if I could
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
follow up how many how many of those 20
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
sites are also occupied by Homeland
 
04:40:21.708 --> 04:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
Security or State Police many of them a
 
04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
few of them
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent of them
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar enough to say that well
 
04:40:31.090 --> 04:40:31.100 align:start position:0%
take home land security out of it
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
police Communications could you find
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
that out there four percent with State
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
Police I'm sorry about 50 percent with
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could follow up with me
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
on that I'd appreciate it okay and did
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
if I could Mr chairman that's why it
 
04:40:50.930 --> 04:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
didn't come earlier they uh
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
gentlemen did I see somewhere in here a
 
04:40:55.250 --> 04:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
lapse on
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um expansion of the Mount Washington
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
was that one of your items
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that was a request request to extend to
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
extend if if I could get some follow-up
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
on that project where we are on that
 
04:41:13.250 --> 04:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
also I'd appreciate it
 
04:41:14.570 --> 04:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
um if that would be all right with you
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I can give them to you now if
 
04:41:21.770 --> 04:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's true what do you got helpful so
 
04:41:24.128 --> 04:41:24.138 align:start position:0%
the uh the project is under construction
 
04:41:27.410 --> 04:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
right now we've got the first Seasons
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
Construction in this past summer where
 
04:41:31.930 --> 04:41:31.940 align:start position:0%
we've done the initial site work
 
04:41:35.470 --> 04:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
including retaining walls slabs on grade
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
and the treatment plant itself which is
 
04:41:42.170 --> 04:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
packaged plant is being fabricated at
 
04:41:45.490 --> 04:41:45.500 align:start position:0%
the company that's doing it as we speak
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
so by on the cost basis we're about 40
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
through the project
 
04:41:52.850 --> 04:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
and we expect the major construction to
 
04:41:54.170 --> 04:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
go next summer
 
04:41:55.970 --> 04:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be both the sewage
 
04:41:57.770 --> 04:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
treatment plant and we have combined
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
this project with uh water tanks uh
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
water water system upgrade so both of
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
those will be going on next summer and
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be uh substantially
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
complete with that by October but the
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
treatment plant company needs a full
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
season of commissioning work so we'll go
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
into the next season where they'll have
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
people adjusting the system and making
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
sure it's actually meeting the standards
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
that they have to hit for treatment
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
plants thank you one one last if I could
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
so when when that is complete and it's
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
well needed when that's complete will
 
04:42:36.250 --> 04:42:36.260 align:start position:0%
will it increase the capacity up there
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
more activity was to happen do you have
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
some idea of whether it was built for
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
what we have now or maybe 20 percent
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
more or something well the system that
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
we have in place now uh handles about 3
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
500 gallons per day okay and it was
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
designed to handle spikes up to five
 
04:42:55.860 --> 04:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
designed to handle spikes up to five
thousand

04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:42:58.970 --> 04:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
so before we started this project we
 
04:43:00.890 --> 04:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
were getting spikes up to seven thousand
 
04:43:02.650 --> 04:43:02.660 align:start position:0%
gallons per day regularly
 
04:43:05.570 --> 04:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
the new system is designed to handle
 
04:43:07.010 --> 04:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
seven thousand gallons per day with
 
04:43:09.410 --> 04:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
spikes up to ten thousand thank you sir
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
at ten thousand we reached the that's
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
our water supply limit we can't
 
04:43:18.430 --> 04:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
unless we find somewhere you get water
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for that
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't there some years ago an effort to
 
04:43:24.320 --> 04:43:26.170 align:start position:0%
wasn't there some years ago an effort to
uh

04:43:26.170 --> 04:43:26.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
combine the radio tower uh forces uh I
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
think it was under with safety is the
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
lead agency so everyone wasn't building
 
04:43:36.890 --> 04:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
their own radio infrastructure and
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I remember having
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
happened that's correct we had we did a
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
study of the summit Communications
 
04:43:45.410 --> 04:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
facilities to see what would be the the
 
04:43:47.208 --> 04:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
best way to go forward
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
we used HL Turner as our consultant uh
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
they came out uh with a proposal a cost
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
estimate of about 14 million attached to
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
it which was way way more than what we
 
04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
had in mind so we've kind of backed off
 
04:44:03.050 --> 04:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
to take another look and I it's going to
 
04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
be considered it's part of the
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
consideration that's going on now with
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
the master plan that has just been done
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
by the Mount Washington Commission and
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
they're asking for some funds in this
 
04:44:13.128 --> 04:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
capital budget to do an assessment of
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
the top of the mountain which will
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
it has firstnet done any overlays onto
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
your Towers any of your towers do you
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
know I don't know the answer to that
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
looks like no one else so unless you'd
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
like to say something else thank you
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we're expecting our next agency at
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
three so we'll be in a brief recess till
 
04:44:48.718 --> 04:44:49.850 align:start position:0%
three so we'll be in a brief recess till
then

04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
that'll be Transportation that's our
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.650 --> 04:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
while I have everyone here
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh I mentioned earlier that we were
 
04:45:06.050 --> 04:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
expecting to hear from peas and we did
 
04:45:10.730 --> 04:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
and they those are items 174 5 and 6 and
 
04:45:12.530 --> 04:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
they would like all of those uh
 
04:45:12.540 --> 04:46:22.270 align:start position:0%
they would like all of those uh
continued

04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.368 --> 04:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't know
 
04:46:46.970 --> 04:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just trying to I don't know
 
04:46:46.980 --> 05:01:53.208 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just trying to I don't know
questions

05:01:53.208 --> 05:01:53.218 align:start position:0%

um starting on line 184
of

05:02:45.610 --> 05:02:45.620 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%

want to do it I think that would be good
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with uh and we're going
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
to be passing it back and forth based on
 
05:03:04.250 --> 05:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
our portfolios minus Aviation Rail and
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
Transit so I'm going to start with that
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then I'll pass it off to assistant
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner rodrigue to uh to cover his
 
05:03:14.208 --> 05:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
and and we'll take it from there as we
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
go through our various lapse requests
 
05:03:20.590 --> 05:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
so starting on line 184
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
State Au 9342 that's the five percent
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation match
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'll handle uh line 184 I'll
 
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
refer back to the same explanation as we
 
05:03:36.530 --> 05:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
go through because uh for appropriations
 
05:03:39.830 --> 05:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the last biennium
 
05:03:43.128 --> 05:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
the biennium beginning in 19 The Binding
 
05:03:44.930 --> 05:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
beginning in 15 the biennium beginning
 
05:03:46.850 --> 05:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
in 13 as we go through this list it's
 
05:03:48.410 --> 05:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
going to be the same explanation for the
 
05:03:50.930 --> 05:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
FAA five percent match and the bottom
 
05:03:53.690 --> 05:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
line uh the reason we're requesting the
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
extension is we you know we are spending
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
older money first if you look at this
 
05:04:00.650 --> 05:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
particular line line 184 there's zero
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
percent encumbered right now but that's
 
05:04:05.448 --> 05:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
because we are spending older money
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
first this money is still going to be
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
programmed against requirements and uh
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
and FAA is going to be matched for fa
 
05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
projects at our other system airports uh
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
as time moves forward this this money is
 
05:04:21.410 --> 05:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
typically spent over about six to eight
 
05:04:21.420 --> 05:04:22.490 align:start position:0%
typically spent over about six to eight
years

05:04:22.490 --> 05:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:04:25.850 --> 05:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
and as we get into other items you'll
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
see that uh the reason that we still
 
05:04:30.770 --> 05:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
have 13 money that we're closing out is
 
05:04:32.448 --> 05:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
because we try as we spend that old
 
05:04:32.458 --> 05:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
because we try as we spend that old
money

05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:04:37.490 --> 05:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
We Lay projects in against it and this
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
accounting unit can't close until those
 
05:04:41.810 --> 05:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
projects also close so it's it's very
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
typically six to eight years that we use
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
to spend down this money obviously the
 
05:04:48.410 --> 05:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
coveted pandemic threw a wrench into
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
some of that and also uh we do
 
05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
anticipate some additional uh bill money
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
so moving on to line 185 that's Aviation
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
management software we're requesting the
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
lapis lapse extension because that
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
project is ongoing it's about 10
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
complete that's our aircraft
 
05:05:11.570 --> 05:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
registration software and that's on
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
track for completion as scheduled
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
line 186 is the public transit bus and
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
facility match the the real story on
 
05:05:26.770 --> 05:05:26.780 align:start position:0%
this Labs extension request is that
 
05:05:29.448 --> 05:05:29.458 align:start position:0%
Rolling Stock has been increasingly uh
 
05:05:31.970 --> 05:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
difficult to acquire during the pandemic
 
05:05:35.810 --> 05:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
there's delays those funds are all um
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
are all programmed
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
we have the needs based on the age of
 
05:05:41.930 --> 05:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
the fleet and recapitalization please
 
05:05:41.940 --> 05:05:44.570 align:start position:0%
the fleet and recapitalization please
sir

05:05:44.570 --> 05:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.330 --> 05:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
days on finance
 
05:05:49.850 --> 05:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
um when you roll up roll the buses back
 
05:05:52.010 --> 05:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
in to go to the white Farm
 
05:05:54.050 --> 05:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact they've been going
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
offshore and getting top Buck does that
 
05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
money when they're when they're
 
05:06:00.530 --> 05:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
auctioned off go back to the general
 
05:06:03.770 --> 05:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
fund or does it go back to agency
 
05:06:06.170 --> 05:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
so there there is a combination because
 
05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh F uh FTA does require us to roll
 
05:06:14.330 --> 05:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
that into future your Acquisitions but
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
at least part of the money does does
 
05:06:18.890 --> 05:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
roll back depending on how much it's a
 
05:06:21.288 --> 05:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
split ta yes yes and you don't know the
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
percentage or I don't off the top of my
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
head that's something I could definitely
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
get for you though sir I just know it's
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
a combination of those two and that's
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually based on a change in policy
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
from FTA
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
um just this last year thank you so much
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.650 --> 05:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
line 187 uh is uh is the accused rail
 
05:06:45.050 --> 05:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
Improvement the story there is also a
 
05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
pandemic story
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
um in that uh contractor supply chain
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
materials have taken longer than
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
expected but that is also on track for
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
completion by the end of this calendar
 
05:06:57.840 --> 05:06:59.930 align:start position:0%
completion by the end of this calendar
year

05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:07:02.930 --> 05:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
and at that point for after line 188 I'm
 
05:07:04.850 --> 05:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
going to pass it over to assistant
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner rodrigue and I'll take you
 
05:07:09.170 --> 05:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
through the next few items
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:07:17.448 --> 05:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
line 189 is a match for a grant that
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we had submitted
 
05:07:22.730 --> 05:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
um for the the Main Street Marine
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
Terminal we were not successful with
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
that Grant we would like to carry these
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
forward these funds forward in case we
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
have successful on a grant in the in the
 
05:07:33.420 --> 05:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
have successful on a grant in the in the
future

05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
line 190 is a fuel management system
 
05:07:38.878 --> 05:07:39.910 align:start position:0%
line 190 is a fuel management system
replacement

05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative he's eaten that's the
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
system you asked about last week and
 
05:07:48.530 --> 05:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
that is in in progress we would like to
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
continue working on the implementation
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
of that system we will not spend the
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
entire 4 million and whatever we don't
 
05:07:58.368 --> 05:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
spend we will apps
 
05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
um in the future line 191 is our
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Lancaster building repair
 
05:08:06.000 --> 05:08:07.190 align:start position:0%
Lancaster building repair
um

05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
that project is still in design we're
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
working with Public Works to get that
 
05:08:15.530 --> 05:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
out we did have some delays on that
 
05:08:15.540 --> 05:08:16.490 align:start position:0%
out we did have some delays on that
project

05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:08:21.550 --> 05:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
line 192 is a
 
05:08:25.250 --> 05:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
patrol shed and salt shed replacement
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
project we're in the design
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
um process for that project yes
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative is that the one that has
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the liquid salt or or liquid treatment
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
or no right this this shed does not we
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
do make liquid brine out of our Dairy
 
05:08:44.810 --> 05:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
shed and we share that amongst several
 
05:08:48.288 --> 05:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
of the other other sheds in the area
 
05:08:53.690 --> 05:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
line 193 is a work order system phase
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
two we are implementing a wolf what we
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
call Wolfie which is work order Fleet
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
and inventory system and that's a
 
05:09:06.410 --> 05:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
computer system that lets us plan
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
schedule and then measure the the work
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
we do on both dot assets such as roads
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
and bridges but also on our buildings
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
and Fleet equipment as well we'd like to
 
05:09:26.448 --> 05:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
keep working on that line 194 is our
 
05:09:26.458 --> 05:09:27.970 align:start position:0%
keep working on that line 194 is our
um

05:09:27.970 --> 05:09:27.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
biennial salt shed replacement program
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
that is 1.7 million dollars from the
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
last biennium we're in the process of
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
Designing those projects and we'd like
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
a patrol shed remodel at our Manchester
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
Patrol shed most of that work is
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
complete we were able to work out of
 
05:10:01.250 --> 05:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
that remodeled Patrol shed this past
 
05:10:03.288 --> 05:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
winter but there's a little bit more
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
work to do to close up the the books and
 
05:10:08.050 --> 05:10:08.060 align:start position:0%
close out that account
 
05:10:11.570 --> 05:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
and I'll pick it up at 196. that is the
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
fy19 version of the first item I covered
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
for five percent match for FAA project
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of these funds uh in online
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
196 will be encumbered uh during this
 
05:10:28.010 --> 05:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
biennium right now you could see it's
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
about 34 percent spent and we do
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
forecast the majority of them will be uh
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
will be spent this biennium
 
05:10:41.448 --> 05:10:41.458 align:start position:0%
line 197 is the active railroad Bridges
 
05:10:43.730 --> 05:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
repairs to state-owned Railways and
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
again this is uh this has been impacted
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
from Material availability uh during the
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic this These funds go to uh to
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
our much needed Bridge repair on our
 
05:10:58.128 --> 05:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
active Rail lines so we're requesting
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
that they be carried forward
 
05:11:02.570 --> 05:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
line 198 is Coos County rail
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
improvements again supply chain issues
 
05:11:07.550 --> 05:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
but the St Lawrence and Atlantic
 
05:11:09.890 --> 05:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
railroad has ordered and received the
 
05:11:12.050 --> 05:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
materials and they plan to complete it
 
05:11:14.690 --> 05:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
during this calendar year
 
05:11:17.570 --> 05:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
that project so as anticipated it will
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
be completed an invoice and calendar
 
05:11:22.010 --> 05:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
year 2023.
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
line 199 is the public transit bus and
 
05:11:28.850 --> 05:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
facility matching funds and it's it's
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
the same story I've been singing on the
 
05:11:33.288 --> 05:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
transit side that is that is based on
 
05:11:37.490 --> 05:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
Rolling Stock chassis availability we
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
are encouraged that it does seem to be
 
05:11:43.730 --> 05:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
loosening up a bit still not a good news
 
05:11:46.610 --> 05:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
story but we do anticipate over the next
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
two years this biennium we should see
 
05:11:54.128 --> 05:11:54.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.730 --> 05:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay line 200 Statewide equipment that
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
was a 10 million dollar project to
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
replace our
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um Fleet equipment all of that money
 
05:12:09.650 --> 05:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
except for for 85 dollars is currently
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
encumbered we do want to carry that
 
05:12:14.330 --> 05:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
forward so we can complete those those
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
purchases as quite a lag time on
 
05:12:16.798 --> 05:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
purchases as quite a lag time on
delivery

05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%

almost complete we'd like to carry those
 
05:14:28.010 --> 05:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
funds forward so we can complete and
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
close out the project
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%

software
 
05:14:56.810 --> 05:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
um there are certain currently several
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
initiatives from doit that are impacting
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
this this document software including
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
our implementation of Microsoft teams in
 
05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
SharePoint we're letting those impacts
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
settle out so that we can scope this
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
properly and we'd like to carry those
 
05:15:15.170 --> 05:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
funds forward please
 
05:15:19.550 --> 05:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
line 207 is our initial work order
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
system appropriation again where we're
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
completing the design and implementation
 
05:15:28.610 --> 05:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
of that software and we'd like to carry
 
05:15:30.230 --> 05:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
those funds forward
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
line 208 is a 2019 allotment for
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
um Statewide Fleet equipment we have
 
05:15:42.890 --> 05:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
um purchase orders out for that
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
equipment we'd like to carry things over
 
05:15:49.128 --> 05:15:49.138 align:start position:0%
so we can complete those purchase orders
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
and line 209 is is the same story is
 
05:15:54.350 --> 05:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
primarily for vehicle Acquisitions you
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
could see that uh particular Au is 50
 
05:15:57.120 --> 05:15:59.570 align:start position:0%
could see that uh particular Au is 50
expended

05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
expended
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
um again this is a pandemic availability
 
05:16:05.590 --> 05:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
of vehicle chassis and my my comments
 
05:16:07.970 --> 05:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
previously applied to this item as well
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we're requesting to move forward
 
05:16:14.810 --> 05:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:16:18.770 --> 05:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:16:21.530 --> 05:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
um there's been about three different
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
line items split up between you
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh for vehicle
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
acquisition that has been purchased and
 
05:16:34.730 --> 05:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
delayed with all this now as these
 
05:16:36.770 --> 05:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
vehicle comes over the next several
 
05:16:38.810 --> 05:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
years would they meet the current
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
standards or are they going to be
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
already obsolete by the time they
 
05:16:46.250 --> 05:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
fulfill the order
 
05:16:47.650 --> 05:16:47.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:16:50.570 --> 05:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
Representative bogert no so the uh the
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
transit chassis uh
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
they would not they would not be dated
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
at all they may you know they might
 
05:17:01.010 --> 05:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
maintain current standards FDA hasn't
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
changed those basic standards for quite
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
some time
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and these Acquisitions are are
 
05:17:08.448 --> 05:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
generally for new chassis
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and as they're expended it's roughly
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
the same as my colleague here it's
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
roughly a decade of use
 
05:17:16.970 --> 05:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
um give or take that we get out of these
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
out of these vehicles so they're
 
05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
replaced on a schedule and that's all
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
done in coordination with the Federal
 
05:17:25.368 --> 05:17:25.378 align:start position:0%
Transit Administration but they thank
 
05:17:26.930 --> 05:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's a good one but
 
05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
for these particular vehicles they would
 
05:17:33.288 --> 05:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
and same for the same for the highway
 
05:17:39.170 --> 05:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
side they'll be current the vehicles we
 
05:17:41.090 --> 05:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
had ordered have been sold to somebody
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
else once they came out of the supply
 
05:17:43.920 --> 05:17:45.230 align:start position:0%
else once they came out of the supply
chain

05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
chain
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
um shortages from covid
 
05:17:52.368 --> 05:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
line 210 repair arches and and Walpole
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is a a railroad project
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
um with some Stone arches uh have
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um failed and I Bridge maintenance Crews
 
05:18:05.930 --> 05:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
have have worked with the rail folks to
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
to go in and Shore those up and clean
 
05:18:11.150 --> 05:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
those up and we have some more work to
 
05:18:16.448 --> 05:18:16.458 align:start position:0%
to do on those line 211 is the 2017

05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
released on projects that have been done
 
05:18:27.890 --> 05:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
and complete and we'd like to continue
 
05:18:31.368 --> 05:18:31.378 align:start position:0%
to reinvest those and updating our
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
underground fuel tank replacement
 
05:18:33.000 --> 05:18:35.150 align:start position:0%
underground fuel tank replacement
program

05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:18:39.970 --> 05:18:39.980 align:start position:0%
um line 2012 salt sheds again that's a
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
2017 funding we have some projects that
 
05:18:46.490 --> 05:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
are ongoing and making use of that
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
funding and we'd like to to continue
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
those as well line 213 is a Manchester
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
Patrol shed that was for the design of
 
05:19:01.128 --> 05:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
the the patrol shed work that's done
 
05:19:04.128 --> 05:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
we'd like to keep a little bit of that
 
05:19:07.610 --> 05:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
going to as Public Works finishes up the
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
administration of that construction
 
05:19:12.410 --> 05:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
project we have some charges that will
 
05:19:14.570 --> 05:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
continue to come in
 
05:19:19.310 --> 05:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
line 214 is uh dixville Patrol shed
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
facilities that was
 
05:19:21.958 --> 05:19:22.610 align:start position:0%
facilities that was
um

05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
the capital appropriation to replace our
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
Patrol shed in in dixville that's
 
05:19:32.690 --> 05:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
currently under construction and we'd
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
like to carry those funds forward to
 
05:19:36.890 --> 05:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
complete that construction
 
05:19:41.448 --> 05:19:41.458 align:start position:0%
line 215 is the uh FY 2015 version of
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
the same FAA match that I've described
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
earlier that goes to development and
 
05:19:48.650 --> 05:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
funding improvements of our 13 federally
 
05:19:50.410 --> 05:19:50.420 align:start position:0%
funded airports
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
that particular Au is 83 spent right now
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
we do anticipate by the uh by the end of
 
05:19:58.368 --> 05:19:58.378 align:start position:0%
this biennium that'll be all spent as
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
well our general strategy is to spend
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
all the older funds first and we will
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
continue to do that
 
05:20:08.690 --> 05:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
line 216 is a public transit match
 
05:20:08.700 --> 05:20:10.310 align:start position:0%
line 216 is a public transit match
um

05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
same story on on pandemic and supply
 
05:20:16.490 --> 05:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
chain issues there this is the 2015
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
version of that same line and again we
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's a small amount that's
 
05:20:23.890 --> 05:20:23.900 align:start position:0%
remaining and there's approximately 96
 
05:20:27.170 --> 05:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
expended and and we do anticipate
 
05:20:30.288 --> 05:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
um completing that and closing that one
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
out by the end of this uh this biennium
 
05:20:38.090 --> 05:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
line 2017 is our 2015 underground fuel
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
tank replacement project there are still
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit of funds in there that
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
are released as uh the projects uh
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
finished up in the designs are finished
 
05:20:58.368 --> 05:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
up and we'd want to make use of of those
 
05:21:00.170 --> 05:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
funds as well
 
05:21:02.170 --> 05:21:02.180 align:start position:0%
line 2018
 
05:21:07.368 --> 05:21:07.378 align:start position:0%
is a 2015 Welcome Center project that
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
provided some Capital funds to do some
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
work on uh welcome centers
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of work there to be
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
done and we're very careful and and what
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
we put our funds towards we would
 
05:21:25.610 --> 05:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
disappointed with a bid we did for the
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
um little Tim Welcome Center about a
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
year and a half or two years ago in the
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
bids were simply too high to to get the
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
work done at the time
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
um but we do have more work to to do
 
05:21:41.208 --> 05:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
05:21:45.890 --> 05:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
on 219 is again FAA 5 match that's the
 
05:21:48.890 --> 05:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
2013 version of that very small amount
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
of money remaining in that accounts
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
approximately 99 expended
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
um again as we uh spend down those funds
 
05:22:01.368 --> 05:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
um we can't close out that Au until
 
05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
those funds are expended that project is
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
complete so we do anticipate that
 
05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
closing out in this biennium
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh lines 220 and 2 I'm sorry go ahead
 
05:22:12.120 --> 05:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
uh lines 220 and 2 I'm sorry go ahead
sir

05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
I was just remarking on how old these
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
are these are carried forward from
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
prehistory it really is 2013 and and
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
again when uh if projects come in under
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
budget or
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir the next two oh oh yes the
 
05:22:32.448 --> 05:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
next two 220 221 those are um those are
 
05:22:35.208 --> 05:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
really the funds that are there so that
 
05:22:38.570 --> 05:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
we have money available just in case we
 
05:22:41.690 --> 05:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
need to acquire rights of way and write
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
a first refusal on rail properties and
 
05:22:48.530 --> 05:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh they're more or less I mean they're
 
05:22:49.730 --> 05:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
not permanent accounts but they're
 
05:22:52.128 --> 05:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
considered uh funds that are there only
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the event that we need them for those
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
purposes and those purposes are
 
05:22:58.190 --> 05:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
important if we do have those needs it
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
is important for the Department to have
 
05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
those funds available
 
05:23:04.128 --> 05:23:04.138 align:start position:0%
because we have to respond within 90
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
days to those rights of first refusal
 
05:23:08.448 --> 05:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
requests so having those funds available
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
is crucial for our ongoing Mission
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's why those accounts were
 
05:23:13.550 --> 05:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
established but as you say
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative they are they are fairly
 
05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
old and they continue to serve their
 
05:23:18.060 --> 05:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
old and they continue to serve their
purpose

05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
same with line 221 that's uh for the
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
acquisition of railroad and Airport
 
05:23:28.490 --> 05:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
properties is necessary under the writer
 
05:23:32.570 --> 05:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
for first refusal and uh because and the
 
05:23:34.368 --> 05:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
only reason again they exist is because
 
05:23:36.650 --> 05:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
of that 90-day deadline that we have if
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
we do need to take action and secure any
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
Properties or meet our legal
 
05:23:41.820 --> 05:23:44.150 align:start position:0%
Properties or meet our legal
requirements

05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:23:47.330 --> 05:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
so with that that does conclude our
 
05:23:50.810 --> 05:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
lapse extension requests and we're
 
05:23:56.830 --> 05:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative bogert
 
05:24:02.570 --> 05:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you once again
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
um item 213 was the design of the
 
05:24:10.250 --> 05:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester Patrol shed and that was
 
05:24:13.128 --> 05:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
previous is that also funded in this in
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.730 --> 05:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
as far as the construction of it yes yes
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's actually three capital items
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
that that have to do with that
 
05:24:27.770 --> 05:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester Patrol shed this first one
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
was for the design of it there's another
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
one for the construction of it and then
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's a third one where we came back
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
to ask for some additional funds once we
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
get the bids in and current estimates to
 
05:24:46.190 --> 05:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
complete the Manchester the the dixville
 
05:24:49.090 --> 05:24:49.100 align:start position:0%
and the Lancaster district office
 
05:24:52.610 --> 05:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
expansion we keep the design funds
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
Capital item open because that's what we
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
use to pay public works for the the the
 
05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
work they do in the Consultants do their
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
Architects to design the project and
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
then oversee the construction as well so
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
that project's just wrapped up
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
um punch list items and we'll have some
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
bills that continue to come in
 
05:25:18.730 --> 05:25:18.740 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
when we're designing these salt sheds is
 
05:25:25.788 --> 05:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
the basic structure
 
05:25:28.550 --> 05:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
our the building structure itself if it
 
05:25:31.930 --> 05:25:31.940 align:start position:0%
was done by itself are pretty standard
 
05:25:34.970 --> 05:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
as far as the design and then how it
 
05:25:36.970 --> 05:25:36.980 align:start position:0%
fits on the ground would be the only
 
05:25:42.410 --> 05:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
deviation in that right for for our salt
 
05:25:46.730 --> 05:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
sheds the answer to that is is yes with
 
05:25:50.090 --> 05:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
with a little bit more explanation we
 
05:25:50.100 --> 05:25:51.230 align:start position:0%
with a little bit more explanation we
have

05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:25:54.770 --> 05:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
um different capacity shed so there
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's three or four relatively
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
standard designs and then it's a site
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
work as as you say that gets customized
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh so with that being said we as a
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
department we look at some of the cost
 
05:26:18.050 --> 05:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
savings hopefully of re utilizing some
 
05:26:21.530 --> 05:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
of the designs as you move across the
 
05:26:22.970 --> 05:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
state doing this
 
05:26:31.788 --> 05:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar uh thank you Mr
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
chairman and thanks for the answer to
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:26:39.050 --> 05:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning of this on the
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
189 the four million dollars for the
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
Market Street uh terminal there Marine
 
05:26:44.638 --> 05:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
Market Street uh terminal there Marine
Terminal

05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
Terminal
 
05:26:46.080 --> 05:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
Terminal
um

05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:50.448 --> 05:26:50.458 align:start position:0%
do you is there any other projects in
 
05:26:52.128 --> 05:26:52.138 align:start position:0%
the near future you you're thinking of
 
05:26:53.930 --> 05:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
trying to apply for that's four million
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
dollars sitting there
 
05:26:55.980 --> 05:26:57.170 align:start position:0%
dollars sitting there
um

05:26:57.170 --> 05:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:58.850 --> 05:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
are we gonna apply for it again or
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
something similar or
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
so not that we know of in the immediate
 
05:27:07.368 --> 05:27:07.378 align:start position:0%
future but as you know and have probably
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
heard about the iija
 
05:27:13.010 --> 05:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and the federal funding that's that's
 
05:27:14.930 --> 05:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
available for infrastructure
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
construction a lot of that money came to
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
us in Formula funds some of it came to
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
us and and program funds but there's
 
05:27:28.250 --> 05:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
there will also be a significant number
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
of grant opportunities so we do
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
currently have a Grant application in
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
right now for the funding of of the
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
replacement of the general Sullivan
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
Bridge which is a a pedestrian bridge we
 
05:27:46.610 --> 05:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
we most likely would not use these funds
 
05:27:50.030 --> 05:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
to to match at that Grant
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
um but it's grants like that that we
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
need to be nimble and and able to apply
 
05:28:00.770 --> 05:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
for and may need matching funds where we
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have other opportunities that
 
05:28:05.448 --> 05:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
we would ask to keep this These funds
 
05:28:05.458 --> 05:28:06.708 align:start position:0%
we would ask to keep this These funds
for

05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:28:09.050 --> 05:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
thanks for follow-up
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
and also
 
05:28:10.680 --> 05:28:11.690 align:start position:0%
and also
um

05:28:11.690 --> 05:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
is the work going to be done at the
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
Marine that it was scheduled for this
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
this particular Grant was it done some
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
other way yes that work will be done
 
05:28:23.448 --> 05:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
some some other way there is a project
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that is completing design right now
 
05:28:29.570 --> 05:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and that work is scheduled to
 
05:28:32.510 --> 05:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
advertise late this summer
 
05:28:32.520 --> 05:28:33.830 align:start position:0%
advertise late this summer
oh

05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:28:35.810 --> 05:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
one time thank you
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and is the
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:28:41.868 --> 05:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a design but um how are
 
05:28:44.288 --> 05:28:44.298 align:start position:0%
you going to pay for it
 
05:28:47.330 --> 05:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
so we are paying for that with federal
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
funds with Federal Highway funds that
 
05:28:54.650 --> 05:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
that work was was done to mitigate the
 
05:28:57.288 --> 05:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
the impacts from the Sarah Long Bridge
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
replacement which ties it to
 
05:29:04.670 --> 05:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
um our Federal Highway funds
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
one last time please thanks
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm familiar with what this
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
funds was for so are you are you
 
05:29:16.010 --> 05:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that project you put it
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
out for design but do you have a funding
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
mechanism for that at this time we do
 
05:29:23.208 --> 05:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
that that project is funded at this time
 
05:29:24.890 --> 05:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
in our 10-year Transportation
 
05:29:28.490 --> 05:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan okay thank you thanks
 
05:29:32.330 --> 05:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
how do we repurpose something that's
 
05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
meant for Market Street Marine Terminal
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
to a different grant for a different
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
project do we have a path to do that
 
05:29:41.628 --> 05:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
through fiscal or something we we do I
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
think we we come back to this committee
 
05:29:47.090 --> 05:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
when we have the need and we ask you if
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
we can repurpose These funds for for
 
05:29:52.128 --> 05:29:52.138 align:start position:0%
that need and you would give us a yes or
 
05:29:57.770 --> 05:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:57.780 --> 05:30:03.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:30:03.368 --> 05:30:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.050 --> 05:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
sorry I just add one you get you shut
 
05:30:08.448 --> 05:30:08.458 align:start position:0%
down Dave go ahead I just wanna I'm Bill
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
Cass the commissioner I also want to add
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
one one thing I think the language of
 
05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
that was was written generally enough to
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
allow it to be used as a a match for
 
05:30:20.208 --> 05:30:20.218 align:start position:0%
other discretionary opportunities the
 
05:30:22.128 --> 05:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
one point that that is important is that
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
we have very little State money in our
 
05:30:26.448 --> 05:30:26.458 align:start position:0%
in our program we rely on toll credits
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
and stuff so to compete competitively
 
05:30:31.010 --> 05:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
for any discretionary grants they
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
usually look to bring more
 
05:30:35.690 --> 05:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
they usually look for those
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants to leverage other
 
05:30:40.970 --> 05:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
other than federal funds so having some
 
05:30:42.670 --> 05:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
State funds available to match
 
05:30:45.770 --> 05:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants makes it um
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
makes makes it more um a competitive uh
 
05:30:52.010 --> 05:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:30:53.930 --> 05:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Edgar there are a
 
05:30:55.610 --> 05:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
number of projects that we are looking
 
05:30:57.530 --> 05:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
at like I said Dave they've noted the
 
05:30:59.570 --> 05:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
one we applied for this round because it
 
05:31:03.050 --> 05:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
kind of fit those those criteria but um
 
05:31:04.970 --> 05:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about Ocean Boulevard
 
05:31:08.090 --> 05:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
and other ones in in the in the Seacoast
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
as uh some of the other discretionary
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
Grant programs focused on resiliency and
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
climate change come up um we feel some
 
05:31:17.770 --> 05:31:17.780 align:start position:0%
of those projects will compete
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
well for those discretionary grants and
 
05:31:22.490 --> 05:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
and again
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
being those projects of are all
 
05:31:27.288 --> 05:31:27.298 align:start position:0%
federally funded uh having some match
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
having some State match to put towards
 
05:31:31.850 --> 05:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
those grants and make them more
 
05:31:31.860 --> 05:31:33.010 align:start position:0%
those grants and make them more
um

05:31:33.010 --> 05:31:33.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:36.050 --> 05:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
competitive is fairly instrumental so
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
that's a big part of what that
 
05:31:38.218 --> 05:31:39.410 align:start position:0%
that's a big part of what that
um

05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that line item that that uh that Capital
 
05:31:51.490 --> 05:31:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions uh thank you
 
05:31:57.288 --> 05:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
gentlemen it's always a pleasure to see
 
05:32:00.430 --> 05:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:10.490 --> 05:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
now that was our last agency so uh my my
 
05:32:12.170 --> 05:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
plan would be to
 
05:32:14.930 --> 05:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's right here take tomorrow on the
 
05:32:16.970 --> 05:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
snow day to write a report for the full
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee and present it to a work
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
