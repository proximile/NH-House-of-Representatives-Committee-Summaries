00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
right you have to use the microphone
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
sorry not paying attent you you got to
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
pull it closer I understand the uh the
 
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.269 align:start position:0%
pull it closer I understand the uh the
gold

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
gold
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
is traded traded quite you know a lot of
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
it but uh I I came across that or
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
somebody told me that the our gold
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
standard the gold that we already
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
have and and it's in the treasury I
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
guess uh the unit St treasury Fort Knox
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's fort fort well Fort New York I
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
think uh but the uh but the but it had a
 
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.710 align:start position:0%
think uh but the uh but the but it had a
stated

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
value in other words it's not traded and
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering I think Trump
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually U I think that's what got me
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
interested Trump said he wanted to raise
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh put put that gold into the market and
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
because it's three four five six seven
 
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
because it's three four five six seven
times

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh above the U uh the
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping uh on on the government it
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that our gold is it it's exactly what
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
happened with FDR I mean FDR had the the
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
gold was like 32 bucks an ounce
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
something like that and and then they uh
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
then they uh he lifted it no there and
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's how he raised Cas not that I'm
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
any expert on this issue so Keith you'll
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
help me out but my memory was that yes
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
we used to be on the gold standard okay
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
and we he took us off the gold standard
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
but yet the gold is still on our balance
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
sheet so that it rep it represents uh to
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
anyone who is concerned about in
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
investing in the dollar or exchanging
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
the dollar that yes we do have uh a hard
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
asset behind it but it's obviously not
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
transferred it's not you know it's it's
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
just uh nothing else is security it's
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
collateral I I just uh thought that
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
Trump said that on the bookkeeping I I
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
really pay little little attention to
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
what he says I'm sorry I just don't pay
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
any attention it's got nothing to do
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
with this bill right he we have learned
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
already that he says things and hasn't
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
really F thought it through but yes
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon yes so uh just to
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
clarify the gold that we have for the
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
government it's stat
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
statutorily def fined as
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
$422 an ounce and the market value is
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
2900 so the the the treasury is treating
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
the gold as much lower value because a
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
statute was put in in
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
1973 and that the actual market value
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
was way over multiple multiple times
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
that $2,000 so I was just wondering
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
what's what's the impact if any on on
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the the impact is is that
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer has to rationalize
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
investing in gold well the treasur she
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
has to explain she has some explaining
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
to do and but that the fact that the
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal government has a lower list
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
price but it's actually exchanging on
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
the Open Market at a much higher price
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
it that just has nothing to do with it
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
it just it just shows you that we're
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
under the federal government is
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
undervaluing that collateral so we're
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're obviously going to be trading at
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
the US market there's something that
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be said when we were when we
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
were in with the treasurer talking about
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
this she said you can write what you
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
want in here and that gives her tools to
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
work with but she's got a board of
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
directors and she's got uh evaluation
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
services like uh standard and Po's Moody
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that she's not going to move on any
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
of this this is not telling her to
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
actually invest in gold this is saying
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future if it looks like
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
a good investment go ahead and and if
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
Moody's changed his attitude towards it
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's my question I just uh I I knew
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
there was a discrep I I'm glad you
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
brought it up and we would have to buy
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I've learned something new today
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
we'd have to buy that market value so
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
the statutory price we would not be able
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
to I'm pretty sure the federal
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
government is not going to sell it to
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
you can have your it back to you
 
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
go okay all right 639 so uh
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
amendment uh he just passed it out so
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
0445 uh
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
0445 okay so what's in here what are we
 
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:19.230 align:start position:0%
0445 okay so what's in here what are we
left

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.909 align:start position:0%
 
with

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
yeah right so um
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
why don't you give us the global what
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.789 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
Mike in talking to folks about the
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
private key aspect we decided that it
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
was best to just remove that from the
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill instead of bicker over it um so
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's been deleted the whole private
 
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
that's been deleted the whole private
key

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
key
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
thing um I took out two definitions so
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
one is home digital asset mining I took
 
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.630 align:start position:0%
one is home digital asset mining I took
that

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
out and and private key that those two
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
definitions were no longer
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
used uh let's
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
see 39
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
V2 is that
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
page holding in use of private digital
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
three right so this is what uh
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
holding that curs
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay so right now um we were just
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
mentioning on page three we have on line
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
six is the holding and use of private
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
digital currencies do we change anything
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph no that's the same okay so the
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph We did change is start on
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
14 that's right it's line 21 on page
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
three on the amendment right
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
line 22 so that's the new language that
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
we discussed
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
in no state or local government agency
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
or subdivision thereof shall set a
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
specific limit on sound decimals
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
generated from noise including digital
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
asset lining other than the limit set by
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision and any local
 
00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision and any local
noise

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
noise
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances and then we Str so this is
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
based on feedback this is based on
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
feedback from the municipal Association
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
John you'd asked me to reach out to them
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
they took a look at it um even though
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note said they looked at it
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh they said they didn't see it so so
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
now they have and they uh suggested
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
striking some things which I took out
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
there was a there was an old number
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
B that had to do with specific limits of
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
decb they said that that wasn't
 
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
decb they said that that wasn't
needed

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
and the the SEC the
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh the line that says it's line
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
24 that used to be much longer so now it
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
just says impose any requirement on
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining business that does
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
not equally apply to all industrial
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
zones there was something about a
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
positive incentive for encouraging
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
staking and they said they
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't they said municipalities don't
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
have a way to incentivize things so that
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
was Su
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
Superfluous and then I took out U making
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
a Zone a zoning change to an area with
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the digital asset mining Business
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
Without conducting all required notice
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
and hearing procedures they said that
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
has to be done anyway we don't need to
 
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:33.270 align:start position:0%
has to be done anyway we don't need to
State

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
it and then there was another thing
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 677 or any related
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
provision of law talked about a
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
court court shall prohibit any zoning
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
change if the change was made to
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
determine against the digital asset
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
mining business they said that that
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's not needed either
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
so so those were that section's probably
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
half the size that it was y uh question
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
Keith what what about the use of
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
electricity uh that's later on in the
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
bill that's discriminatory
 
00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:12.909 align:start position:0%
bill that's discriminatory
rate

00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
see so discriminatory rates is defined
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
definitions okay there's the definition
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
so where's the reference to it in the
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
Statue uh it is a new number four
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
just have a lot of red lining I'm going
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
through here right it's in that same
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
section we were just reviewing I assume
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
three a rate schedule for digital asset
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
mining creates a discriminatory rate for
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining businesses it just
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
clearly says that the rates have to be
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
the same you know
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
you can't just pick that business and
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
say you're going have a higher
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
R then the right to private Keys section
 
00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:11.710 align:start position:0%
R then the right to private Keys section
was

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
removed and right I told you we we was
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
easier to just get rid of the whole
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph and give that charge to the
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.580 align:start position:0%
piece changes um
 
00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.190 align:start position:0%
piece changes um
[Music]

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I probably missed this but uh are we
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a regulatory uh um
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
division that is
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
specifically um I mean is Commerce going
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
to be the regulator here this committee
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
or is it going to be the treasurer uh
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
well in terms of which paragraph of the
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill you're talking about well we're we
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is a whole currency thing and and
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
I'm where where do you Curren
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
be well the holding in use of private
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
digital currency is just simply that no
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
no state or government agency would
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
restrict it so who's the enforcer of
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that well who's who's yeah if some some
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
local government does it someone can
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
take them to court and say they
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
violated well is that the someone
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
division of the the government I mean uh
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
well Attorney General Attorney General's
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
office yeah that would either attorney
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
or or banking counts on how and what was
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
the it what was the nature of the
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
situation that that Government tried to
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
pass that resol come in under Commerce
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
under this
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
committee true there's no but and also
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and consumer
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
protection comes under this committee so
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes we are the we are the regulator of
 
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
yes we are the we are the regulator of
the

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.029 align:start position:0%
the
statute

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay which really frightens me but uh
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
but I was just trying to figure out if
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
they were going to have a a a group of U
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
experts in treasury or or in in the
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
government full-time who are
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring and uh you would you would if
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
you had a problem that's who you would
 
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.070 align:start position:0%
you had a problem that's who you would
go

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
to well I I guess which SE the bill
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but the section
 
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about right now yeah
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
where it says no state or local
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
government agency no state or local
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
government agency no state or local
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
government agency that's written three
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
times that no regulator in that
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
case that if some state or Local
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
Government tried to do what this says
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
you can't do you would sue them they
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be sued were well actually their
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
legal beagles would tell them don't do
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
it because it's illegal so it wouldn't
 
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
it because it's illegal so it wouldn't
happen

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
all right I'm to me that sounds like
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not being
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
regulated uh we are what we are saying
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
in these particular pie you have to
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
remember what the purpose of this bill
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
is and and I would say on the on the
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
face of it I generally am not for
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
prophylactic legislation I use that word
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
because that's what Neil Kirk taught me
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
to use okay some some people call it
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
some people call Proactive at any rate
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
normally I don't do that I usually wait
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
till the plane crashes and then figure
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
out you know how to solve it why are you
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
doing it now because after this whole
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
debate around zoning right now and how
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
the state is now stepping in and trying
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
to tell cities and towns what to do okay
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't agree with that okay because
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
they delegated that Authority that
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
really if the state didn't want to do
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
that or they didn't that should have
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
done it upfront and that's what this
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
this bill means to me is that we're
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
saying right now ahead of
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
time that do not
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
treat digital currency don't treat
 
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.909 align:start position:0%
treat digital currency don't treat
blockchain

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
blockchain
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
mining uh as as as different than any
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
other zoning regulation if when it comes
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
to utility
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
and it comes to noise that whatever new
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance you want to pass in your
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
town it's got to be fair and proportion
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
and not t
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
targeting digital
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
currency and that's and that's the
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm in support of this
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay represent Bros yeah I have a
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
question um I don't think we went over
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
it but so you know when you have too
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
many air conditioners on the system can
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
crash so
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
what's to protect you know a
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood or an area for their you
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
know too much utilization of electric
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
power yeah that's a good question I mean
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
just like any other large load would
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to you know likely get uh approval
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
through the Pu process you know if they
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
need if they need large uh interconnects
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
for large amount of electricity but also
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
like the rates themselves right
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
so you kind of have to break out of like
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
the scarcity mentality that using
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
electri electricity is is a bad thing it
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
using electricity incentivizes the
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
creation of more distribution more
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
generation right and so over time the
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the system corrects itself right
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
follow up though okay but you know I
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
live with you know I live in uh a big
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
apartment complex and you know it's a
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
really hot day everybody's got their air
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
conditioner on and it goes kaput so I'm
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to be concerned about the same
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
thing um with this and you know is it
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to impact my ability to run my air
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
conditioner to run my computer and all
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff I think I I want to
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this okay okay and that is
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh what I know about utilities okay and
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
that is um you hear all the time about
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
rolling blackouts okay you hear about
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
how they're actually telling people to
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
turn off devices okay now that clearly
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's voluntary they're they're telling
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
you ahead of time to do that but it's
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
really voluntary what I would say is is
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of um how a utility monitors
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
and making sure that there's plenty of
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
power okay um we have we have there is
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
the base rate know the rate for the
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
consumer rate okay and then you have the
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
corporate business rates okay and but
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
then you're right now that buying that
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
wholesale power is different each each
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
one of our bills can be different okay
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
you could signed up for a different
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
power producer than I'm signed up for
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
but in any case the utility has um is is
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
uniquely to you know paying attention to
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
temperature rises to variations to
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
making that prediction and ensuring that
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
there's enough power you know going to
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
be enough power so that they don't have
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
to it's not a power breakout problem it
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
really is not a power breakout and and I
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
have to say but I I just got to throw
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
this humorous aspect in that is that um
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
even though we had my wife says I snore
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
too much and we do have a noise maker
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know I have a noise maker right now
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
her noise maker of choice is the air
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
conditioner and we run it in the
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
wintertime at
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
night I'm telling you we have the noise
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
maker but she wants that AC and she cuz
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it also drops the temperature in the
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
room she just loves that thing so the
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
good so there there's a seat up here for
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
you so and
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
so may I say one thing just in response
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
um what's interesting about digital
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
asset mining is it can be a very large
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
load and then in a few minutes it can
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
turn down to almost nothing right so
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's a variable load and what that what
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
that does through the price signals in
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
the electric grid it it uses extra
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
electricity so when electricity is cheap
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
they're running when the price goes up
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
because there's too much demand they
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
shut off and they sort of absorb the
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
extra capacity on the grid so that's
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
something that people don't quite
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
understand I think that one of the
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
tells

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
tells
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay we're still here right just that's
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
why I'm see I'm seeing all these people
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
enter in the room okay okay no problem
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
no problem you are on this the
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay and I'm I'm just
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
missing a couple Republicans so you're
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
now just trying to keep it fair and
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
balanced okay so we have hunt pusk Ammon
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
Walsh Herbert melier Spear and
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
salvi all right so um any other
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
questions about this amendment I would
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
like to make one of the things that I
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
see that's that's kind of good about
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
having something like this is it gives
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
local communities what they need to aim
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
at right exactly and they can say well
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right from now on our noise level in
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
this town is going to be whatever it
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
actually gives them the tools they need
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
to say I better start aiming at some of
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
this stuff not that I would ever do
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
anything like that of course but some
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
people might no I think it's good giving
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
them guidance it's a good thing okay
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
be very obvious but uh
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
um crypto Bitcoin is quite volatile in
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
terms of its pricing in the market and
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm I'm
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
questioning um what might be the impact
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
of paying the electric bill for the
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
who's saying for the minor no no that no
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
they still got to pay pay in dollars
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not giving them an
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pay their electric bill
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
in Bitcoin okay they it's totally
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
distinct it's going to be a dollar it's
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to be dollar okay their electric
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
bills cannot change that's the whole
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
point it can't be discriminatory it
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
can't be different yes I left one thing
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
out of the things that we removed from
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and it's just coming to me the
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
blockchainbased trusts section is
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
removed and I think we'll put it in 310
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
to study it I think it's a great idea
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%
but it just needs a little more uh
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
flushing out you know we get some
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
experts talking about it
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
so okay good okay representative
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
one one com I would make about this
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
one right to hear oh one comment I would
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
make about this one it really doesn't
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
have anything to do specifically with
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin or anything like that it has to
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
do with the
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
technology of blockchain which can be
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
used for almost a lot of stuff I've seen
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
it used for a lot of different things so
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
I I think we have to you have to open
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
your mind a little bit about the fact
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
that it's really not aimed specifically
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
true okay right 41 we need an amendment
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay paint program all right um so uh I
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
do have an
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
amendment but it's all it's in draft
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
form at this point because this uh this
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
was a last minute
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
production two
 
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.430 align:start position:0%
production two
three

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
four

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
five okay one for me all right all right
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
so uh this being passed around as you
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
remember in the public hearing the
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussion was around uh the fee the fee
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
that fee the infamous fee and um and and
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
I take full responsibility that what I
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
was offended by was that this fee
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
assessment uh would be um I guess some
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
states thought it was important that
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
it'd be on the invoice other states
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
didn't you know but at the end of the
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
day the whole idea of the fee being
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
involved and what the fee is and and and
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
we were putting in Statue what the fee
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
was going to be that is just that was an
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
anatema for me um and
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
what what really you know would I guess
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
what goed me more than anything else is
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
is the fee uh which is you initially the
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
paint manufacturers were supposed to
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
project what the fee will be that what
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
their fee would be based upon what they
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
think they're going to sell and they
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
give this money over and where does this
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
money go well it goes to their
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractor who is going to organize
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
who's going to come and pick up the
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
paints and who's going to do the
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
displays and everything like that so to
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
me this seems like you know this is um
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'll choose the bankers they just left
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
so this is like the bankers are having a
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
fee and and they're hiring the banker
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyist to manage the Fe manage the
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
program and and I'm just that
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
just I I just couldn't get behind that
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does right now is uh
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
it takes out all statements about the
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
fee it just simply says there's a plan
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
will be involved yes they whatever their
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
plan is they do need to bring it to Dees
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
to look it over uh and make sure that
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
that uh they're not doing anything that
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
that violates our state statutes in
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the moving this paint you know
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
moving the product um represented Cole
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
at the end mentioned that about the uh
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
back part of the of the statute which
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.790 align:start position:0%
was the
um

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh a liability
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
section yeah so it's on page 3 149 M7
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
liability and
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure and he he he was interpreting
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
that that that means um that they would
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
not be held responsible if they screwed
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
up with the paint and no that's not what
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's about what this is about is
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
because this is assessment them on to
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
themselves all the all the units are
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
been that in other states who have
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
implemented this had a problem of a um
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
CL a uh a uh they
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
were uh I'm losing sping my mind it was
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that they they were working in
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
cahoots with each other and it was an
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
Anti-Trust statute and so that this
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph is simply saying is that that
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
no there's no intent any trust intent
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
with enabling this
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's really probably
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
why we need to pass it in the first
 
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.150 align:start position:0%
why we need to pass it in the first
place

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
so we can let them do that without
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
having to have that lawsuit but at the
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
same time it does not change any
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement of in terms of the misuse of
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
the paint in terms that they make a mess
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're still respons get sued about
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
they can be sued if they you know drop a
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know paint truck on in the middle of
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
the road or they had some kind of no you
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
you were mentioning where I I can't
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
follow where it's said that they
 
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
follow where it's said that they
that

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
gives the liability of where is that
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm looking right now on on page
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
three yeah where down at the bottom of
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
the page
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
disclosure okay that's the one I was
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
about which is really all I wanted right
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
well and
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
really it it itan it's much
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cole was con concerned
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
about what the intent of that was um you
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
know once that was clarified that no
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
this is only about the antitrust because
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're in cahoots with um hitting
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
themselves up for this fee but that but
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
that um so that exempts them from
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
that take the Mone did you review this
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
with any of the folks on the on who were
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
putting this bill forward so Dees has
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
looked looked it over they're happy okay
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
and and uh and I guess we got got
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
members of the paint sitting right who
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.309 align:start position:0%
 
happy

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
this they're they're not they're not
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
finding anything offensive at this point
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
about it right as much as you don't like
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know we we've done it
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
this way um uh but that the
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh okay that's right right
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes so this is basically a silent
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
fee um oh don't bring that I I so in
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of what I would I'll
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
just I'll just kind of put okay I I
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
don't see way I look at it differently I
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
look at it this is um a business expense
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
related to being in the paint
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business that you have
 
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.990 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business that you have
some

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility to what happens to the
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
unused paint and so therefore really
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's their cost of good sold and and so
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
if if the IRS asks me I would say that
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
that that cost is not a revenue to them
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
or Revenue to The Entity that they you
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
know they which I assume it's a
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit anyways but that that their
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyist group who's running this thing
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
but that this is a cost to them it
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
should be on their
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
books thank
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
you I have I want to make sure I
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
understand this uh RSA
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
356 is uh an
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
antitrust correct law yes and
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
um if I read my English
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
correctly a manufacturer or
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative organization implementing
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
or participating in a program shall be
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
exempt from RSA
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
356 right and that is an trust can do
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
all these bad things no no
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's are participating in the program
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not that it goes on to say that
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
they still are responsible for any
 
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
messes or any cleanups and that they're
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
problems yes yeah yeah I
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
would identify yourself uh for the
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
record Jonathan malanson with Demmer
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
prol and Thomas uh representing the
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
American codings Association I think to
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative Cole's Point um that that
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
he brought up last work session um and
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
to just clarify under the definition
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
section on page one um we Define
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
environmentally sound management
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
practices and I think that's where you
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
know this spells out any anybody
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
operating under for this program you
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
know needs to do so responsibly make
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
sure that there's not any messes being
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
made and and so forth so I just wanted
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
to highlight that for right and you can
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
see and the appropriate environmental
 
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.670 align:start position:0%
see and the appropriate environmental
liability

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
coverage on page one on page one in red
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
the only red thing you see there has
 
00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:50.270 align:start position:0%
the only red thing you see there has
been

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
deleted okay so if for whatever reason
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
somebody makes a mistake and pollutes
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
nefarious uh there is going to be a
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
penalty uh associated with this Behavior
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean as long as they haven't you
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
know follow followed the practice and
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that's another reason why you know
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
you have the plan that would be
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Department of
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so that they have
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
that oversight as well to make sure that
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's all all being done Dees will get a
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
crack at exactly what's going
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
on you've seen this
 
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.829 align:start position:0%
on you've seen this
yeah

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
right is this the one I assume I assume
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
they mailed it to
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
you but we have we haven't had the
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up yet because obviously
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
this happened on Friday
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
this okay we have nobody opposed to it
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
and we do have someone from the
 
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.710 align:start position:0%
and we do have someone from the
Department

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
though and you want to make a comment
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
just any you're you're
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
fine you're all good you're all good
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh who would like to make the
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
motion on this bill
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
spear

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay um so this is a straw
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
vote because we don't actually have the
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
hand it's a
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
stra so um no I mean theoretically you
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
know as a chair I can just take up the
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment in in our exact session and
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
say that the uh this this committee and
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
that but we would make sure that the
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
language is exactly what we think it is
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
so okay so this is a straw vote um all
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
those in favors raise your hand one two
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven
 
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven
eight

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
well yeah we draw a vote yeah it's all V
 
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment and then when the
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
full committee takes it up I mean there
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
are a lot of committees that they don't
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
even have a subcommittee vote they
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
just take it and run with it but it is
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
true that I have a little more rules
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
here okay moving right
 
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:57.700 align:start position:0%
along that's it for business
 
00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
along that's it for business

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.150 align:start position:0%

so so um as you know I I've been around
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%

reporter for National Public Radio New
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public radio and uh and his
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
his mother uh actually we see her all
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
the time on health insurance
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
issues at any rate he was I was telling
 
01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
him that we were planning on doing this
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill and he says you know we were up in
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont and we went it we we couldn't
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
get in because we had our team AG
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
daughter with me and I said what is that
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
he says well cuz if you're under 21
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
you're barred from going into a
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
Tavern in
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont so I can only assume that's
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
where you got this language or you came
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
up with this idea
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
hello Danielle ellon deputy chief New
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor enforcement um I we
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
actually didn't pull this language from
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
um any
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
mirroring uh States the reason we did 21
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
plus is um there's no food there's only
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
alcohol there would be no reason for
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
them to come in maybe they want to drink
 
01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
them to come in maybe they want to drink
a

01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
Coke we've so Cocktail Lounges right now
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
um at 9 when they or cocktail lers in
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
general sorry throughout the state are
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
18 plus unless accompanied by a parent
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
guard your adult spout so one of the
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with this is this doesn't limit
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
right now any type of live entertainment
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so while you have
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
a Tavern license that might run as a bar
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
um the downside of this license is it
 
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
also creates nightclubs larger dance
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
establishments late night establishments
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
um which is where the the age
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
restriction came
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
in GE sorry I don't know how my watch
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
um okay so but so right now the because
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
like restaurants can close the food at 9
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
and they have the cocktail license
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
correct but they're not they they don't
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
bar anybody who's you're saying they
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
they bar anybody who's under 18 most so
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
by Statute it's it's um no one can be
 
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
can be in there um unless under 18
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
unless accompanied by a parent Guardian
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
our adult spouse right what we have seen
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
as a general business practice
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry is that once
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
they close the kitchen because they can
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
many the cocktail lers uh can close the
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen at 9: and become a um just just
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
serve serve alcohol the general business
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
practice there is they become a 21 plus
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
facility but it's not by Statute not by
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
Statute no however there are license
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
established there are liquor licenses
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
where they are 21
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh anybody question yes how do we
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
get the notion of it being an optional
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
kind of thing for a
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
town um well basically uh realizing that
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
um there was a uh well AA started out we
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
had this other bill that we're about to
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
get which is these uh social
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
districts and in that social districts
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
I'm stared reading this whole piece
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
about how uh that it's a local Town vote
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
to create
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
that and I said well okay if we're g to
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
allow that to be a town vote you know
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
this particular issue um I've always
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
said that the opposition
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
to no food requirements was uh
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant hospitality
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
industry and law
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement because to law enforcement
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh alcohol only is just a magnet for
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
trouble all right you know when you look
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
at the problems we've had with these
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
knife fights and you know whatever that
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
goes on outside outside a bar it's
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
usually after 9 o00 yeah when those
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
things occur okay and so so I would my
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
theory would be is that um no no
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
selectman in their right mind
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
would ever think this is a good idea
 
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.790 align:start position:0%
would ever think this is a good idea
however

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
um we if we're going to get in the habit
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
of start enabling cities and towns to do
 
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
things that they think is good remember
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill was that
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
Claremont thought that this would be
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
good as a magnet to make people want to
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
live in
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh so what say so if I live in
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
a town and the town really doesn't want
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
a Tavern in there then they never take
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
the vote and it'll never happen oh it is
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
still optional it is totally H not I
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it option I mean you can
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
call it an option I'm telling it's
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
enabling but the town has to vote for it
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
where are the words that say that okay
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
so if you look under um RSA
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
663 colon 5 1B C and D is that right 66
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
y so that that's standard language in
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
all of our statutes right now pertaining
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
to any license so that's uh we do still
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
have I think we're down to two dry
 
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
communities two two dry communities in
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
this in this in the state itself so
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's allowing um that's allowing
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
licensed licensed alcohol establishments
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
to be in the town um under
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
541a we are required to notify the town
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
of any license establishment that has
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
applied for a liquor license um in their
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
municipality or city they can then
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
submit any um data views concerns
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
objections to um that license being
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
issued to the commission and then
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's a hearings process for that um
 
01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
this also specifically um allows the
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
city or town to limit the number of
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
tabern licenses within that municipality
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
if they so choose so they could say yes
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
we'll a tabern license but they can they
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the town or municipality can can decide
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
to to limit that it was I'm sorry there
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
it was something you just said now in
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
the first bullet I guess I one the
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
commission May issue a Tavern license in
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
any town to which as voted except to
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
accept theion to have liquor licenses in
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the town in general oh that's in general
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's in general correct correct and
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's standard language if you were to
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
look at to in any of the the statutes it
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
would say a cocktail lounge license will
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
be issued or a this that specific
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
license will be issued if that City all
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
city or town allows so this is more than
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
enabling it's it's the town has to pay
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
attention and find out that somebody has
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
actually applied and it's after the fact
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
that they find out that somebody's
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
applied that they've applied
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
to we're doing that now in our town in
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
our town it'll take forever before
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
anybody finds out that thing will go up
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
and it'll be active before anybody has a
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
chance to stop it so so we do that now
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
so every application that comes in the
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
Township's getting notification from US
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
asking for any objections or support for
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
the establishment so this we're looking
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
at this as if this was accepted and and
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
this becomes law that business doesn't
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
change for us
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing it now no I understand she's
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that the tavern license should not
 
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
be issued unless the town has made this
 
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
be issued unless the town has made this
affirmative

01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
motion afferent vote so we need we need
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that says
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
that now is that in the social District
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
Bill uh cuz I was just going to list the
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
language from the social District Bill
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and you tuck me out of it it could be
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right the the the good news is
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not an early bill so we
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
have time to keep continue to work on
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
this okay so but at at this point we
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
know one thing that needs to be added to
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
it is that this cannot that you the
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
license cannot be issued until the town
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
has had that affirmative vote yeah I
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that we can I think the social
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
districts is more that the Town sets
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
what the social district is before the
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
licenses are issued so there was a
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
process there where there there was a
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
process but it was to set right what the
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
area was any stipulations that wasn't
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily a vote of the town that was
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
just by the the city however they do it
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
every every city does that different SEL
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
or the city council yeah I mean so
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
number words in my town there would be
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
three Selectmen would make correct two
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
out of the three port for example has a
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
liquor board has a specific board that
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
they actually have a liquor board that
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
votes and and makes decisions so every
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
municipality does it differently okay
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about um point six I I
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
just think that that opens the door for
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
corruption a select board
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
member says oh my friend has has a has
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
wants a license I'm going to give it to
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
him and I'm going to make sure there's
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
no more so there's no more competition
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
so uh that's I would I I I don't want to
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
create the we always say it the New York
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
City taxi cab medallion situation that's
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
why I forgot bought the marijuana stuff
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why I would fight this one so
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
could we remove that part of it like if
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
if if the town is going to opt into this
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should opt into it and
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
then say Oh but they get to decide
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
there'll be one or two favored well I
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
think that's what that's what we're
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
replacing the other language with that
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
line would be that the town would do the
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
affirmative and then you could let them
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
in right so for all kind of purposes
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
that that particular language is being
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
removed but you will it'll say
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
instead right and the and the little the
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
the number one at the bottom obviously
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
so so there wouldn't be like a cap a
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
potential cap on licenses but we we
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%

in this in here that anybody has a
 
01:19:12.639 --> 01:19:20.310 align:start position:0%
in this in here that anybody has a
problem

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
with no person we allowed in the tab no
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
out in the tavern license yeah that's
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we're calling them a Tavern
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
license and Mr chairman if I you change
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
it to premise yeah if if I can just uh
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate from our previous testimony we
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
have not changed our opinion on you are
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill we are no that's
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
that's important GL you reminded
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
us not so much opposed uh just that we
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
believe food needs to be part of the mix
 
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
in serving alcohol in this state so um
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
CH my research she she sh in the Roman
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
number one the two was trous the
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.629 align:start position:0%
 
license

01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
voted well that's actually you got it
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
right if you just write right in their
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
Li that's sort of a chicken of the egg
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't know they we don't know
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
they exist that that is the process now
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
so right now they apply they cannot they
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
apply for the license they cannot get
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
the license without Town
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
approval right now in any license
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
whether it be a combination or a
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant or yeah any prevence
 
01:20:55.320 --> 01:21:02.590 align:start position:0%
restaurant or yeah any prevence
yeah

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no no they have it's a No Object I
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say an approval it's a no
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
objection from the town so they're g a
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
time frame they're given a time frame
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
where they can submit an objection some
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
of them do submit approvals um but then
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
but there's a time frame to say if you
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
object within right now it's 15 so this
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
is a waiver from that process because
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is saying is no you're not we're
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
not waiting you know from there to hear
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh to hear if you have not have any
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
problem with it is that you have to make
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
affirmative we can we can clean the
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
language up so that it would that they
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
have to have actually approval from the
 
01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.470 align:start position:0%
have to have actually approval from the
town

01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
right the six the
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
6635 is just the town accepting that
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
they'll allow license alcohol licensed
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
establishments in general doesn't say
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
what kind what type right that's
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
standard language throughout title 13
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
the town has to accept that they have to
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
not be a dry community so we can issue a
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
license per statute if the town is voted
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be a dry Community anyways anyways
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
anyway doesn't mattering that this the
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
this is the next so that first one is
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
you might want to Reber things here a
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
little bit and that's standard language
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
but what it sounds like we're looking to
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
add is that there has the town has to
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
either approve the tavern or vote to
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
have a tabern license have an
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
affirmative affirmative vote by
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote has to be affirmative
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
vote for the town before before the
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
license is
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
issued and if there if it if there is
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
opposition that triggers due
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
process that'll trigger a
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
hearing right now just put it would have
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
shut down the conversation right you
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
would shut down the conversation of
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
being a Tavern license right now yeah so
 
01:22:54.199 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
being a Tavern license right now yeah so
you

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
to there's two proc so right now if the
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
town objects there's a hearings process
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the lensey to go through within that
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipality in front of the hearings
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
officer for the commission where people
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
can submit their all their all their
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
infavor of or opposed to that's it right
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
now this sounds like this would just be
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's an approval you're going to
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
allow a Tavern license or not so so it
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't if the town votes against
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
approval if the town votes for it that
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
means that hearing process doesn't occur
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
because the now the town has actually
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
voted to approve it if they don't
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
approve so another words there's a
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
waiver from that statute well that that
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
particular requirement no I I think I
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
think you have to do this in two ways
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
the town has to allow the tavern license
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
applications to go in but there's still
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
the process on the application itself
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
who the lenses are Who The Operators are
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
so so that would still to me the
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
application should say right on the
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
application the town you know please
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
include the town's vote they voted for
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
it it should just be you know please
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
report you know when was what was the
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
date when the town voted for it okay
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's what you should do just be on the
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
application so because you would ignore
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
the application if they don't F in that
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
it you follow me there no okay in other
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
words d okay the whole process is right
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
now is if you want to get a liquor
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
license you download the form and you
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
fill it out and you submit it to the
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
commission the commission does not just
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
approve it because you submitted the
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
form they then have a couple of steps
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
they go through and one of them is do
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
you have your liability insurance do you
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
have do you that that we're going to
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
send a letter out to your town
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
and what's the time frame that the town
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
has to
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
respond right now they right now it's 15
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
days okay so within 15 days the town has
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
to say we have a problem if the town
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they don't have a problem
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
then they The Liquor Commission just
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
checked it off that's the process now
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
for all our license you know for our
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
liquor license what we're doing is a
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
little bit different with this one this
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
one is on that application it needs to
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
say has the town voted for this license
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
and what was the date they made that
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
vote they're going to read it when they
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
see the
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
form the form will have it on there and
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
say what was when the town affirmed
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
it the town if the town voted no then
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
then if they submit that that
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
application the the liquid commission
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
would say no you're re Ed because you
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
did not check off the box that the town
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
happen it's all about checking the Box
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
other words when you when you f when you
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
fill out a form when you fill out a form
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
with any getting any license and permits
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
and stuff there going to be a bunch of
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
boxes you have to check okay yeah all
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
right and so the check is for with the
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
commission to say okay we've got this we
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
got that You' submitted this you
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
submitted that that one of those items
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
is going to be did the town of the town
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
because one of the items is that the
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission checks The Liquor
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
Commission checks the Box correct so one
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
of the other questions is that when it
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
asks the town the town they can say to
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
the town you have a problem about where
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
the location
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
is because the tavern is putting in the
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
location right don't you guys one of the
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
questions you're asking the town is not
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
just you know you know for you have any
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
objections what objections may you have
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
well one of them would be well we don't
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
like it that's right next to the school
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
or we don't like it because you know
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's next to a church or we don't like
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
it you know because it's in a in in our
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
it violates our
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
zoning okay can be any one of those
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
things the town can object to then they
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and in that hearing if the town
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
will come up and make a convincing
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
argument that they don't want it in that
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
that area in that zone then the
 
01:27:30.109 --> 01:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
commission will not they will not check
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
rejected about uh I don't know two
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
months ago when it was a little warmer
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
out we had a
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
shootout we had a shootout in nashille
 
01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
in front of a bar yes and uh two people
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think were shot and I don't know I
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
think one of them was
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
killed and
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
that bar I don't know what I mean I've
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
seen it every single day and it's a it's
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
a it was a messy place to begin with I
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how they were allowed to stay
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
in business but they
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.239 --> 01:28:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
up

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
but I want to see the town be much more
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
proactive about stopping this as opposed
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
to just checking a little box if they
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a if they they have not proactively
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
said I want a Tavern correct if they
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
have not said it correct then no taverns
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it make sure this is
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
question number
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
one right off the top has the town voted
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
to airally approve it I'm wonder it has
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be number one I think
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
Kino is has the same thing that's right
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
has a similar thing where the town had
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the town but it had to be done in a town
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
meeting formerly in the town they had
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
accept in the town meeting are they
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to allow lift that language we can
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
do it similar to that that's lift that
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
language that's perfect Kino is
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
definitely a good example because my
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
town kept voting against
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
it Keith next then represent W okay
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um it sounds like the we need
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment that has that language the
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
enabling language like the actual text
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
that goes on the ballot in statute like
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
the keyot yeah exactly and that's where
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
I got it from when we do the social
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
districts Bill
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay no all representative walls
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
then representative BS okay maybe this
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
is more of a would you believe
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
but I just had to do a permit which was
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
a unbelievable process for a retaining
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
wall which involves Dees and Dees this
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
is for you Carri DS will not process I
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's tons that had to be filled
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
out by the applicant but they were
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
specifically looking for the signature
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
of the Town Clerk and the um
 
01:30:04.239 --> 01:30:05.550 align:start position:0%
of the Town Clerk and the um
conservation

01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I mean that can be part
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the process I bet you that is in the
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
Kino Kino language it has to be some
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah our so our we have there's two
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
processes right now so for a general
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
license um that's where there's no
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
objection from the town town has the
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
ability to respond we give them the
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond if they some do
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
some there's other types of licenses
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
such as a a catering license for a
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
catering event or a one- day event where
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
you need actual signatures from the fire
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
department the chief of police the town
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
selectman you know things specific
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
signatures saying you're allowed to have
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
this event again some of them are in the
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
Town Square or you know they're they're
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
in in public places that affect the town
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
so there there's two proc processes to
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
that um it sounds though like what
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
they're looking for for this is rather
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
than that the process for the specific
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
license would still apply but you can
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
only apply for the tavern license in the
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
town if the town has voted to allow
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
Tavern license applications to be
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
submitted it still doesn't there's still
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
the General application process which is
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh you know the applicants the
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
the that would still apply but the town
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
would have to vote it sounds like the
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
language preferred is similar know the
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
town would have to aote that they would
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
allow the a Tavern license to be apply
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
right so the default is no Tavern and
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
they have to apply to get a Tavern the
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
the town would have to vote to allow
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
Tavern license applications to be
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
accepted and then the the applicant
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
itself would have to apply and then they
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
would go through the normal application
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
process that would be great if you can
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
write that up just a quick
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
question how how do so we have statutory
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
language in this new Amendment uh
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
who proposes that to go onto the ballot
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
can can uh It Be petitioned by the
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
members of the town is that yeah any
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
warant article can be by petition 10
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
people so it's not just up to the select
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
board to
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
decide or
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the okay meanless if they want they can
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
find 10 signature you know they I mean I
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
assume they have authority to put things
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the warrant but I you know like the
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
planning board I know does things the
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
planning board has to be a vote of the
 
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
planning board to put more articles
 
01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.669 align:start position:0%
planning board to put more articles
on

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
bureaus thank
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
you this may fall into the category of
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
dumb idea but she already thinks it is
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
but have ever been anything like on the
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
applications for a license that say you
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
know taverns are encouraged to have like
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
bar food like popcorn or something
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
because you know just a statistic about
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
what alcohol does to you without
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
food yeah we could put that language on
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
the I mean you at this point this
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist so you could put any
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
language on there is that I mean is that
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
make sense or it will not do anything I
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
think it's at the end of the day it's
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
the business the business
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
plan but I assume that they're liable if
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's if somebody goes out and crashes
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
their car out yeah just like any other
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
license establishment
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
y there is no doubt there's no doubt in
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
my mind that to get
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
to get one of these Tavern licenses in
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Massachusetts that the the
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
liability insurance is
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
higher but I mean you're you're
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
balancing that off with you know the
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
fact that you don't have the food you
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
know the costs of the food so and that
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
was representative Sullivan's argument
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
right the beginning ago was that you
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
know you want to you want to streamline
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
make it easy to just open up one of
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
these things so but one of so uh we
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
never discussed the ual license
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
fee just
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
sto of course thank you um as you and I
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
have spoken uh Mr chairman uh this arose
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
predecessors years ago yes and and the
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
deterrent was a pretty
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
hefty um fee fee um I think at the end
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the day you establishments such like
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
such as this that don't have food along
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
with them bring other Dynamics to them
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
some of which have been mentioned today
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
um it takes a larger enforcement effort
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
um which is is of course uh
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
car equal equal to fees that that are
 
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
being charged for a license type so um
 
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.310 align:start position:0%
being charged for a license type so um
uh

01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
I haven't researched the background of
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
those fees back in the day but it was a
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000 I thought it was as sponsor of
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
the bill I think it was 10 grand but I
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day our largest
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
25 no that's what it started out I don't
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
think that ey um our largest fee right
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
now is 1280 and the amount of effort
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
that would be put into enforcement would
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
far for a lack of a better term would
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
bury that number
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
beate that's our highest fee now that
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
cocktail just shows you how easy it is
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
to get a liquor license in New Hampshire
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's only
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
1280 okay plus a business
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
plan so you don't have a number yet or
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a number right now we'll
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
have Aiden work Aiden's actually
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
listening to us right now so we can have
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
him can you do some just some multiple
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
of that fee mean
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
that seems like a reasonable way to do
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
it and then it would it would adjust
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
over time if if you guys raised one it
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
would automatically go up two times we
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
don't like raising and lowering fees we
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't we like I'm not saying we should
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
or shouldn't I'm just saying if for some
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
point in the future somebody decides
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
they need to raise the fee and this is a
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
multiple of the highest fee then it
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
would go up accordingly right so I'm not
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
advocating for raising fees let me
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
multiple of the 1280 you're saying that
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
the answer yeah answer should be uh four
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
or five times the 1280 I I I don't know
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
what the time should the amount should
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
be but I'm saying that might be a good
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
way to do
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
it okay you got that Iden I I don't
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's just an idea it's uh let's a
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
let's not make it so pun punitive that
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
people can't like get in
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
5 well if you want to get back to where
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
before we don't need to use that as a
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
benchmark I mean we're not trying to
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
like kill this before it gets out of the
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
gate are we or maybe we are that's
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
probably what people are actually trying
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
to stand corrected just that's probably
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
what everybody but me want I after
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
saying what I have just said we now have
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
my the third the third leg has just
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
arrived in the room the Chiefs Chiefs of
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
police and and I assume is in opposition
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
to this amendment
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah no I'm assuming okay and just
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes like our
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
cigar bars right now are very similar
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
other than they have they have uh
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
introduced cigar smoking in the
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
establishment right they don't have food
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
and how much is there they they are are
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
some of our yeah 12 1280 they're 1280 um
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the amount of
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
effort that the mun Municipal
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions put into enfor uh safety
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
efforts let's call them Life Safety
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
efforts um they are some of the
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
establishments that you hear on the news
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
quite often so perfect example that 1280
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
is really not the right number if you
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
remove food
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure from I won't speak on their
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
behalf but I'm sure on the chief's point
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
of view they are usually the First
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
Responders to these incidents that it's
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
it looks as if it's an unfunded mandate
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right let's uh let's go with
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.229 --> 01:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
128 I I'll let I'll let the Senate I
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
mean I think the Senate's going to kill
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
this bilding
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
well actually not because you know all
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
the senat the members of the Senate
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee are kind of excited
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
about it but some of them are so so
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
anyway uh so we'll do 640 and I just
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
make one more comment this was the best
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
solution to the previous bill that was
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
submitted that eliminated food um as you
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm a bit of a technical person
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the liquor statutes um
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
there were some there were some concerns
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
with that because it it didn't El
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
eliminate food requirements for other
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
license establishments
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh by by definition you still have to
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
have a kitchen but you didn't have to
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
have food so there was still there was
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
so this was kind of if you're going to
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate food this would this is the
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
cleanest way for us in terms of
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
Licensing and enforcement to do
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
it okay any other comments that
 
01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.589 align:start position:0%
it okay any other comments that
represent

01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
WS yeah I have a question so
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
if in theory if this tavern existed if
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted to serve food could
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
they yes they could they could certainly
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
Ser there no one there's no borrowing
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
cute they they still have to they would
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
still have to have their the the their
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
board the uh housing not what is it uh
 
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
what is usually in each town they have a
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
health officer the health officer offer
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
that would have some you know weighing
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
in on on what the kitchen is supposed to
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
look like and if they did put it in a
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
kitchen then then they've got to comply
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
with it the rules about multiple sinks
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
and refrigerators that have thermostats
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
and okay
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
great and yes you are opposed to this
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but you're willing to help me
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
out in getting it drafted okay Mike want
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
any Mikey doesn't like
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
this he does I'm not sure what you'd
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
like me to say other than no thank
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
you uh you know just emphasize why you
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
will you suspect your members will in
 
01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
the in C in town take this up you would
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
I think are you against it obviously the
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns weighing in is is
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
better than just eliminating food
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
requirements so certainly can get on you
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
know appreciate that we still don't like
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
it as a concept and I think frankly um
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
the real issue for for us would be that
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know $6,400 is not enough of a
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
licensing Fe for what this is going to
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
require of local law enforcement plus
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
the liquid commission Etc um you know I
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
I think the original Tavern Bill going
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
back to your comment earlier I think it
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
started at 25,000 it might have come
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
down during the whole delivery process
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
but but I think it was at $25,000 and
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it should be more than
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
that but that's just my personal opinion
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't talked to anybody about it yet
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
because I just saw this for the first
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
time today so uh that said I think this
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
is just asking for trouble um and there
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
will be municipalities that will likely
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
adopt it um and I just I can't see much
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
frankly not sure what else I could do to
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
change your mind but anyway we just want
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
to get you on record got
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
it okay thanks thank you Beth you want
 
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.189 align:start position:0%
it okay thanks thank you Beth you want
to

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're not you're you're you're not
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay with the bill because you're okay
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
possession only other one other person
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
right right and and like I said you
 
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
weren't here but I I would assume that
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
no town would vote to this in their you
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
know well you never know you there's
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
always going to be some small town um
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you know that that that I but I
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
would think that the small you know the
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh the law enforcement you know the
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
chief chief would point out you know
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
you're just inviting you know Riff Raff
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and my my personal feeling is that
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
I I've I I've never seen a classy
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
one I mean to me they're all hole in the
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
walls but we are going to change it so
 
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
that the town has to allow taverns
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
before they can even apply exactly okay
 
01:43:38.199 --> 01:43:40.270 align:start position:0%
before they can even apply exactly okay
exactly

01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
so okay any other this bill is not an
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
early bill so we're I just wanted to
 
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
have this hearing because uh we had
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
originally taken action in the uh
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had taken had voted on it
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
before but um I I it it felt like
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
unfinished business
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
fun what so a night fight is much more
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
fun to have you know have a night fight
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
right right well no they they're all
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
happening after 9: with the food the
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
food's been shut
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
off right so if we we should repeal that
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
say no you got to serve food all the way
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
thee yeah that's the VFW yes I agree
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
with you he's when I go in the VFW I
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
saying is your mic on make sure we get
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
this all recorded yes I'm not saying
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
that there isn't there isn't crime with
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
these things I just think there it's a
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot of like
 
01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.430 align:start position:0%
lot of like
fearmongering

01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
fearmongering
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
and I've lived in places where there
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
isn't like a night fight every single
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
night because people are out at a bar
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sell food I
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know it's I the biggest the
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
we we do know if you look at the data
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I have looked at the data and I I
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
briefly explored writing my my thesis in
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
grad school on crime
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
on related to these topics and it was a
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
while ago granted but like the biggest
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
predictor of crime is age it's somebody
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
in their 20 is far more likely to be a
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
criminal than somebody in their 70s or
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
80s or 40s like me you know so it's like
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the idea that like oh all we have to
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
do is slap a food requirement on and and
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
crime just Falls it's just it's just not
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
entirely true you know you got to you
 
01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:51.639 align:start position:0%
got to be able to tease out those two
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
differences and I think I think that
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fearmongering going on
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
around around these things and I know
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not making much Headway in
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
convincing people of that and that's
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm glad with this compromise and
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll see a few few towns do it
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe it it leads to something else
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
but um it is frustrating when I listen
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
to people just say oh my God this is
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to the world is going to end we
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
should all be terrified to exist in
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
society more because we don't no longer
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
have food requirements or whatever and
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's just the part that frustrates me
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
when I hear these arguments
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
representa Bros I I actually the knives
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
or guns aren't what concerns me is
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
people getting in their cars without
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
food in their system but
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
again people don't don't have to eat
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
food like you you're making an
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
assumption built into that argument that
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
when somebody goes out they're going out
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
to eat primarily and not drink if
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
somebody is going out to be social and
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
drink then that is their primary goal
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
and the mere fact that there's food
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
there they may have already eaten before
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
they showed up you know I mean a lot of
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
people do that they eat and then they go
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
out to drinks and be socialized there's
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
two different things going on and the
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
thing you don't like is the idea that
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
people are out there drinking
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
irresponsibly overc consuming and making
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
bad decisions whether it's knife fights
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
or drunk driving those are all bad
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
things that are all outlawed that we
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we shouldn't encourage right
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
the idea that the Magic Bullet to solve
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
those problems is to simply just have
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
food I think is just a bit naive and
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's my argument on WR yeah I I
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
I have to say I disagree that that's the
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
Magic Bullet what I I personally believe
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
because we have the same food
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirement when it comes to off-
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
premise lenses we haven't even talked
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
about that okay um we had in the past uh
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
we had a certain representative who kept
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
insisting that spam was on the shelves
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
stores and and I failed to find spam
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
when I went and did you Convenience St
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
check so but I I think going back to um
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
when and I always say I love to been in
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
the room in
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
1937 when after the the prohibition was
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
repealed and how they decided to come up
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the system we came up with um I
 
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
think it was more about uh making sure
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
that the people who were in The Business
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
of selling alcohol uh were fine
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
upstanding citizens
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
and credible because that to them it was
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
all about you know Al Capone and uh you
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
know Speak Easy and on and on and on and
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
I think that that was what was really
 
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
bothering because they weren't so much
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
worried about drunk driving back then um
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know because cars couldn't go very
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
fast and uh so I I think that they were
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
they were trying and intentionally to
 
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
like I said when the food when it came
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the off- premise licenses they really
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that every Town's
 
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.470 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that every Town's
little

01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
IGA you know the the grer the Village
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
grer um was the one who got the liquor
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
license because uh that they're they
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
have an investment they're going to be
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
you know competent they're going to be
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsible and they would be making
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
sure that that they weren't serving
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
drunks and they weren't and uh I think
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing when it goes to
 
01:50:19.229 --> 01:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
restaurants is is is if you don't have
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
that food requirement and I have to say
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
most of all the vfw's do have kitchen
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
I I've never been in a VFW that didn't
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
have a kitchen but that that they the
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue for them um you know in terms of
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
how they they got the waiver well they
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
had the they also had the smoking waiver
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know they didn't we didn't ban them
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
from smoking you know but I think that
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any general
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
establishment and and really refers back
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
to my comment that the ones the ones I
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
know of in Massachusetts that I've been
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
to over the years and are hole in the
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
walls U is that um how how financially
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
responsible how comp you know how much
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
skin do they have to make sure that they
 
01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.950 align:start position:0%
skin do they have to make sure that they
really

01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
are caring people they really are making
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
sure they're not over serving and if you
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
if you have a restaurant now you have a
 
01:51:15.069 --> 01:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
much larger investment you have a lot
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
more but you know way this you know
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
would to me a Tavern you could just take
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
any hole in the wall property you know
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
that could have been a dry cleaner it
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
could have been anything and you throw a
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
bunch of tables and chairs in a in a in
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
a and you know make your own bar or you
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
can buy one off on Amazon and bada bing
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
bada boom and now you're now you're in
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
the in the the liquor business so if you
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
lose your liquor license because you've
 
01:51:41.790 --> 01:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
had three incidents or whatever or
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
somebody dies and they shut you down you
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
know whatever all those those fines I
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't care I don't have that much
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
investment into this property and that's
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
my concern I appreciate that John cuz
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's a better argument than all the
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
other arguments we've heard good so I
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um and I mean I think
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe the the higher
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
licensing and Licensing is annual right
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
you got to pay that every year yes yes
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so the higher licensing and there's
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
still some investment so I think there's
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
some investment I mean certainly if
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
somebody is trying to start off um
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
starting a new bar like they might be
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to do it on the cheap but they're
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
still going to be in it for a five
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
figure number it's not like it's free
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
money that's why I I was my multiplier
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
of and I'm saying even even ignoring
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
that for a second that's an important
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
part of it but I'm saying if I wanted to
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
go start up a bar tomorrow and this my
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
town approved this I mean I would I I
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
would have to find some I'd have a
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
minimum a lease of of of a year that I
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay I'd have I'd be in it for
 
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
five figures right it's not it's not
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
trivial you got some investment yeah
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah be it's not a trivial amount of
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
money and certainly if I acted irr
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
responsibity liquor shut me down in six
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
months I'm out five figures well that's
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of money for most people so I I do
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
think that there's your point is a
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
really good one I think the best one
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
I've heard yet um and but I do think
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
that there's some level of that here it
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't require a mult a sixf figure
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
investment the way a restaurant does to
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
get there I still I still think people
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to be good stewards
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the the food thing
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I already said that if the
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
town wanted it fine knock yourself out
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
but I do think that the investment in
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
what it takes to do food is the
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
investment that keeps it straight that's
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
my point yeah and
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
and even if even if I don't know I I
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
just see these places in Nashville where
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're having these and it's not a night
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
fight it was a freaking gunfight and
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
people were standing there you know so
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
Mike did I just make your point or did
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
you have something else that you wanted
 
01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
you have something else that you wanted
to

01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
so I know the comment was made that you
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
know Claremont wants this because it's
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
going to revive their downtown and
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
frankly that is a stretch um most small
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
smaller towns a restaurant is an anchor
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
in these towns right this is where
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
people go for their special occasions
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
the nights out those kinds of things so
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
it has a much broader appeal this is
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
where an instance where you close the
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
kitchen at 9:00 and you might turn into
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
a nightclub or something to appeal to a
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
younger audience this would work in that
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a scenario but if anyone thinks
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
that somebody's going to open a night
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
Club in downtown claremont's going to
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
change their economic it's just not that
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
that's not how the industry works could
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
they make a little bit of money sure but
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
there's not enough people that live in
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
the area to make this whole thing
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
sustainable that's why they're having
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
the problem it's not really because of
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
the licensing structure if that makes
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
sense any would you believe though this
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
might make an option where somebody
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to be in the liquor
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
business and they can actually have
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
somebody who opens up a small Tavern
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
Tavern license and then somebody has
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
like a pizza shop next door and they
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to be together but they they
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
mutually work well together and I have
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
seen that you go to Boseman Montana and
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
there are bars that don't sell anything
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
but alcohol and then in the same
 
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
building in a different you know right
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
next door there's the Peta pit and which
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
opened up when I was in college there
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
and there's also a Tarantino's pizza
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
that had opened up while I was there and
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
so sometimes having more freedom will
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
give entrepreneurs different
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities to figure out what where
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
their Niche is going to be and I feel
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
like that that's the part that maybe
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're discounting in your argument well
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
but I think what I the point that I made
 
01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
in my original testimony is that you're
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
essentially taking the profitable piece
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the pizza joint's probably selling a
 
01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
few beers with with pizzas whatever to
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
go they're not selling the beer they're
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
sending you next door I understand that
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's but I I just been but what I'm
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that the pizza right now
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
pizza shop right now in New Hampshire
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
may actually be selling beers or
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be so now you're
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
essentially saying that this business
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
that was built on the business model
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
where food was required and let's just
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
take a small right just take the pizza
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
thing out of it small restaurant
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever it might be it has a
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
small percentage of its business that is
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
probably alcohol which is very
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
profitable business for them and now
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow somebody to open
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
up next door from much lower overhead
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
basically free um and they're
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
essentially going to steal that business
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
from them and then now this business is
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
no longer viable so now you've
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
essentially put somebody who has already
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
put their their fam's equity and and
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
livelihood and everything else and you
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
put them in a in a very precarious
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
position and the one last thing question
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
that I have for this discussion is if if
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
you have a license of this type what is
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
it to prevent this license type from
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
opening at 11:00 at night and running
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
till 1 1 in the morning could run for
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
two or three hours total total time
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
correct so it has almost no labor it's
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
just moving booze through the door and
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
frankly that's when the worst of
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
decisions are made and it leads to
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
pregaming and all the other fun things
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
we hear about frankly I I think we were
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
just asking for
 
01:56:51.149 --> 01:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
problems and that's why we're going to
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
charge the extra fee cuz will have a
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission cover the G respond
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
and watching watching drunks enter the
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
enter enter The Establishment and that
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
won't cover the gas that the First
 
01:57:05.229 --> 01:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
Responders are going to have to have to
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
come to the first gun fight not not to
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
mention the second and the third guy no
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
no no we just want our our enforcement
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
division to take care of us okay and
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
local police and that's why and local
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
police and that's why I'm saying the
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
local police would say to the you know
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the to the select or to you know the
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
war i' say please do not vote this is
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you think it's bad enough
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
for you know just just pulling over
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
people on the highway all night long but
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
imagine what if now if now you're we're
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
not doing that we're not getting the
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
Speeders we now we're we're parked out
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
in front of this this Watering Hole well
 
01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
and at $6,400 is there a portion of that
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to be shared with the city
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
and town to cover their local
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement because they're going to be
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
the first Rec call right they're going
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
to be the first ones to respond to
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
whatever the incident is correct and how
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
much of that's an unfunded mandate no
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
not me any did I'm just asking a
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
question they voted for it that's why I
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
did asking a question I specifically
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
that particular problem when I said you
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
know why the high fee even really really
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
belongs to his chief well that's fine
 
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
let's just have the the let the Chiefs
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
fight that at the Town level let the
 
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
police F will take care of it that's
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
what Beth will do thanks for listening
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
all right I think we've had a very
 
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
Lively discussion and good discussion
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
here and uh and we'll end this
 
01:58:20.239 --> 01:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
here and uh and we'll end this
subcommittee

01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
