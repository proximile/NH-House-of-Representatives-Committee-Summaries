00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right well let's get started I
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
believe First up is labor to talk about
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so welcome commissioner Maryfield
 
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 align:start position:0%
and welcome representative
 
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.509 align:start position:0%
and welcome representative
[Laughter]

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
Maguire all
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to make sure the last
 
00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 align:start position:0%
time I was here I did not uh identify
 
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
myself so uh for the record I'm Ken
 
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 align:start position:0%
marfield commissioner at the Department
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
of Labor I'm joined by Deputy
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Danielle Albert and uh uh
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
we observed your disc discussion
 
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday um so I think I know uh some
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
topics that you'd like to discuss yeah
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
the elevators and the yep several topics
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
actually yeah so I think we're starting
 
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.869 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
oh do we have an extra copy of House
 
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
Maguire is there one
 
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
there yeah yeah that should be good okay
 
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
61 um you want to do the elevators first
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
you like sure sure just start at the top
 
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.470 align:start position:0%
you like sure sure just start at the top
okay

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so we're wondering about the fee
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
should it be
 
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
higher yeah and and I can tell you um
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the history that I have been able
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
to look at it does not appear that the
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
fee has changed maybe ever um in in the
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
records that I have locally at the
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
department uh at least since fiscal
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
2014 uh it has been that $50 I can also
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that um in that category of
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue we collect just under $300,000
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
in a in a typical year um if you went to
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
a 100 you know it would result in
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
$300,000 or so how many people work
 
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
inspecting elevators we have uh uh the
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
elevators inspect inspectors we have
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
three and a half uh uh elevator
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors including the
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
chief um we don't do all of the elevator
 
00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
inspections however we have we have a
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
piece of that but we do issue what we're
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
talking about here is the $50 annual fee
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
for each elevator and so there's no
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
other fees that go into this category
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
when I describe the $300,000 we're just
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the certificate that tells
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
the public this elevator has been in
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
inspected and we believe is safe I mean
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
is there a particular accounting unit
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
for those three and a half
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
people uh yes they're part of the
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division um so they reside
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
there in accounting unit
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
6100 okay what page is that in house
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill one do we
 
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
know I just want to generally speaking
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to keep fees at least
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
as much as expenses right for that item
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay let's
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
it starts on 300 sorry 300 and
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
301 what that it starts on 300 300 okay
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division oh but there's 30
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
people there right okay so all of our
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
all of our wage and our inspectors our
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors the boiler inspector
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
all of those people and the support
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
staff that assist them are all in this
 
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
accounting unit okay so but roughly for
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
these 31 people they they are costing us
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
a little over 100,000 a piece if you
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
just take the bottom line and and
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
expenses here so um so we're a little
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
under if you have three and a half
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
people creating 300,000 you see what I
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
mean they should create 400,000 or
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
something Al that's not the only
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
category of Revenue that they generate
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
oh okay um those three and a half people
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
do I don't have it right I don't have
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
have it all broken out for you on the
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
spot here but um all all told the
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division far far out collects
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
their expenses to the degree that we
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
will turn over at the end of the fiscal
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
year over $2 million to you in general
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
funds so they they outproduce their
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
expenses by far by far oh so the they're
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
costing three million but they're
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
creating five or something like that is
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
that the fair enough uh uh you might
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
remember the last time we visited I
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
talked about the restricted fund and I
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
and uh representative you had a question
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
about the restricted fund yesterday um
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
that was a creation of the legislature
 
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
that was a creation of the legislature
in

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
2011 and it represents all of the fees
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
fines uh licenses every other type of
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we generate at the labor
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
department goes into the restricted fund
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
there's a poor portion of our operations
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
including our salaries in fact the
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
portion of that is supported by the
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
restricted fund but the balance at the
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
end of the year is turned over to the
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
state in general funds there's a a
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
transfer at the end of the year and um I
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
mentioned last time we visited uh our
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
best four years of general fund
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
production have been the last four years
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
typically historically the department
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
produce between 1 and and a half million
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
and we've exceeded 2 million uh each of
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
the last four
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
years okay so what is the uh division
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
think maybe $75 does that sound
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable yes representative Rong um
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner marold for taking my
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
question um I missed when you said the
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
last time the fee was um increased yeah
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh I have no knowledge of it at least
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
since I have been at the labor
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
department and and certainly since
 
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.790 align:start position:0%
department and and certainly since
fiscal

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
2014 uh the fee has been exactly the
 
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
same and and written in statute okay
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
speaking of which I would like to
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
rewrite this sentence here um such that
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the the the $50 well the $75 if that's
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
what it is um only appears
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
once not three times Cofe okay
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
so um if you want my help doing that
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
Melissa or and and truly uh uh Mr
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman if I might uh the reason that
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're asking for this language change is
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
because we were putting the cart before
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
the horse it's very clear yeah I don't
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
think we have any problem with the what
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing here right they want to
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
collect the money and then send the
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
certific certificate instead of here's
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
your certificate and it's no good if you
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
don't send the money right I mean that's
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
right exactly okay all right any other
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead um thank you and um Mr
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you know what
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
neighboring states charge for elevator
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
inspections I don't okay I don't
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question but I don't I don't
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
have that with me yeah representative
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
leean thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
morning so do you know how much it costs
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
you to inspect obviously $50 doesn't
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
cover it maybe 75 wouldn't either have
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
you ever figured out what it cost to
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
inspect an elevator because I think you
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
may have told us you have to bring
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
weights in and all that so it's pretty
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
labor intensive right and there are
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about different kinds of
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
activities this fee is is strictly for
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
the certificate saying the state of New
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is aware that this unit has
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
been uh inspected and is safe to operate
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's really all that we're talking
 
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
about is the certificate and the cost
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
for that so follow up so yes go you
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
don't have a a fee for the inspection
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
itself just a certificate we do do y oh
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
it's $100 per hour oh okay well that
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
answers that then so maybe it's not that
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
unreasonable maybe that's why we have a
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
$300,000 plus yeah okay thank you sure
 
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
$300,000 plus yeah okay thank you sure
representative

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire yes thank you I would have to
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
say that a 50 or $10000 fee for somebody
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
that owns a commercial elevator which is
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
the only type that gets gets inspected
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
is is a rounding error it's it's not
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to make a diff they're not going
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
to shut down their elevators if you
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
double the fee so yes okay anybody else
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to represent if the inspection fee
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
is $100 do you think the inspection fee
 
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
is $100 do you think the inspection fee
is

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
adequate hard to say haven't analyed
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
that but again uh these these fees are
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
written in statute
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
um uh and and
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
the the revenue Generation by the
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
division far exceeds the expenses in
 
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.829 align:start position:0%
division far exceeds the expenses in
total

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
right 75 okay so we'll we'll rewrite
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
this and have an amendment for 75 okay
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and we'll vote on it at that time
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
let's go on now the next one I think we
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
accept it
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
already um unless specific Section 1 38
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
we already accepted yes uh so let's talk
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
about what's in
 
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
139 yeah I if you remember this was a
 
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.590 align:start position:0%
139 yeah I if you remember this was a
discussion

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
about um the list of uh infractions that
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
receive a warning as opposed to going
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
directly to civil penalty and the the
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
reason that we asked for this change in
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
house bill to is because although
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
157 grants the commissioner overall
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
civil civil penalty Authority there are
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
other chapters that we enforce that that
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
have different Provisions for civil
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
penalties and so we were just trying to
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
square that up um the the youth
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
employment law and the workers
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
compensation law allow us to penalize
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
without warning and so we we were adding
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
to that list in 273
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
to make it square with these other
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
chapters so this is a list of things
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
that don't need a warning right yes
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and and when these things
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
happen normally you wouldn't give a
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
warning is that it um or
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes okay there's there's
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
discretion okay all right any questions
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
on this section are we okay with it yeah
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay so representive camell's moves to
 
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.110 align:start position:0%
okay so representive camell's moves to
accept

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
Section 13 I'll second it 139 I believe
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
it yes seconded by representative Evil
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
all those in
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
favor okay thank you we we do
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
hands okay um so that was unanimous all
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
right so 139 is okay now second
 
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.550 align:start position:0%
right so 139 is okay now second
injury

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
injury
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes do do you want me to address the
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
house bill two question first or should
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
give us the whole background of the
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
situation and then I'm going to call on
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
the world's greatest workers
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
compensation expert good idea talk about
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
the second injury F so
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
um good morning thank you um so maybe a
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
good place to start is just to give a
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about what is
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
it um and how does it operate so the
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
second really it's called the special
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
fund for second injury so I'm going to
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
call it its short name the second injury
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
fund um it is a mechanism that is built
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
into the workers compensation law uh
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
that makes certain types of
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement Provisions back to
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers who have paid monies
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
on com um acceptable compensable claims
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
so by Statute um and and really
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
historically going even further back you
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
know second injury fund programs started
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
popping up I I think in the United
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
States pretty popularly around the
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
around World War II and they were
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
intended to be in the stated purpose of
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
them uh is to be an incentive to
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
employers to hire and retain individuals
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
who have pre-existing conditions um so
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
through the second injury fund which is
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
funded Itself by insurance carriers so
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at the workers compensation
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
statute there's an assessment mechanism
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
I think we um reviewed this uh last time
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
that we were here with this committee
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's an assessment mechanism whereby
 
00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
there's an assessment mechanism whereby
the

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
total amount of costs paid and benefits
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
by all insurance carriers whether
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're voluntary Market insurance
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
carriers or your self-insured pulled
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
risk style insurance carriers um from
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
the preceding year is taken and then the
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
um there's a
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
115% sort of markup or or modifier to
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
that amount um that that is then
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
assessed back to the insurance carriers
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
who pay either Prat a share of the um of
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
those total expenses to pay into the
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
fund so that's how the fund gets funded
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers can then submit
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
applications we call them eligibility
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
applications if an insurance carrier
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
believes that they have an eligible
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
claim for which they may be entitled or
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
able to get reimbursement um first and
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
foremost as a threshold they have to put
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
the fund on notice so injury occurs the
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
insurance care carer has this claim they
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
have 100 weeks to notify the fund 100
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
weeks from the date of the injury to
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
notify the fund I have a potential claim
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
here for which the fund May potentially
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
be liable if that requirement is met and
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier then you know
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
believes yep I have um all of the
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria I can meet the
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria by providing
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
certain types of documentation and
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
Records they may file the application
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
with the supporting documentation to the
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
Department and a special injury fund
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator reviews it verifies if the
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
statutory eligibility criteria has been
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
met and if so they are entitled to
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
submit for reimbursement going forward
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um for CLA specified claim expenditures
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
so not everything that an insurance
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
carrier pays on a worker's compensation
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
claim is eligible for reimbursement if
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
an insurance carrier can establish that
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
they do have an eligible claim um they
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
can get certain types of workers compens
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
ation expenses paid on that claim
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and primarily that really
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
falls under cash benefits Indemnity
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
benefits and medical benefits certain
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
types of expenses such as Vocational
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation benefits and permanent
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
impairment award benefits are not
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursable by Statute uh so every year
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
by September 1st the insurance carrier
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
can file a application for reimbursement
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
outlining in detailing what they paid on
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
the claim that's vetted um they have to
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
meet a $10,000 deductible before they're
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
even eligible to get reimbursement so
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
they have to prove that they've met that
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and and then if they will be then
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
they if if they have submitted all of
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
that paperwork in a timely manner um
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
they can be reimbursed anywhere between
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
50% to 100% of the eligible expenses so
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's a mechanism whereby certain types
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
of reimbursements um can go back to
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers for claim expenses in
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
general I mean the fund has you know in
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
the past 5 to 10 years and I'll let the
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner correct my numbers if I'm
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
not remember bring them correctly has
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
had anywhere between 16 million to 20
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
million in it it depends on 22 is the
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
highest um kind of depends on the number
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
of claims that have been submitted in
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
the previous year uh and how much was
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
paid out in the previous year is that
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
the throughput uh a million a month or
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
something is that kind of well it's an
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's an annual process I'm sorry yeah
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's an annual process so
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility has to be determined at some
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
point after September member
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
1st eligibility can be determined at any
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
point um it's the balance that's in the
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
fund from the preceding year that's left
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
over then we assess based off the total
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
amount in claim expenses so each year
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
they submit how much they paid in claims
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
then it's modified and that set the
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
amount work so the injured worker has
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
already been comp got compensated and
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
got their claims set settled and all
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
this this is strictly about whether One
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance Company gets money back from
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
this fund or not correct and then and
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
then the industry as a whole is paying
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
the entire cost right of of the program
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
so yes one car one carrier is winning
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
and one carrier is losing right on this
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
case but on the other case it could be
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else right yeah I understand
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
exactly now is this something common in
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
all states or is this something we only
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
have excellent question I was just
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
goingon to go there so so 22 states have
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
sunsetted similar programs um uh three
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
states have never had a program like
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
this so so half the country uh does not
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
have an active program I have in some of
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
the research that that I have done on
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
this uh some states sunsetted the
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
program decades ago and it is still
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
operating because there are these
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
accepted claims that continue and
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue because they they just they
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
have costs every year and so some states
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
are still operating but it's AO now it's
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
a closed system represent Ms thank you
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for coming in
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
course I'm sorry I wasn't here for your
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
original presentation
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
um in those states that have sunset this
 
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.269 align:start position:0%
um in those states that have sunset this
um

00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
mechanism any sense as to what the
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
impact on rates has been I mean my my
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
first reaction is that
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
it would increase rates because there
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
would be no reimbursement
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
for but all I would say about that is
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
that in in the design that we have in
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all of the costs of the
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
program are then assessed on the in the
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers so it's to my mind
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
other than the 15% markup that we charge
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's Revenue neutral to the
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
industry the money goes back to the
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
industry and then we assess the industry
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the program but it's
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
expense positive right I mean you're you
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
and the industry both have to fill out
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
forms and check things and do all this
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that's I think that's a
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
fair argument all right representative
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
McGuire commissioner would would it be
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
fair to say that what this is is an
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
insurance policy so that if some company
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
has a very large claim that is paid out
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
over decades the rest of the insurance
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
company contributes towards it I didn't
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the last the contributes
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
toward paying this extremely large
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
claim yes uh I think the eligibility
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
however is not the the size of the claim
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's um do you have documentation
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
of a prior injury did the person have a
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
subsequent injury are they otherwise
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
eligible as opposed to oh we have we
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a million dollar claim so you know
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
give us that money
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
back okay representative
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
lean thanks Mr chairman so if I recall
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
two years ago you came in with similar
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
language and it was met with some
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
opposition I think uh the former Senate
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
President Peter bragon was concerned
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
about it Bob Scully from the New
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mode of Transport so is this
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
different than what you presented two
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
years ago or similar we did not we did
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
not propose a sunset in this version of
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 because of the opposition
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
of the house the house did not seem to
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
have an appetite for doing that so we
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
did not propose it again uh uh what we
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
have proposed here is had really is uh
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
akin to what uh the chairman was saying
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
about administrative effort the there
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
was a recent Supreme Court case that is
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
um requiring the Attorney General's
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
office to defend the fund
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
in CA in cases where we have denied a
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
claim we have to defend the fund now at
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
two levels of hearing at the labor
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
department plus the Supreme Court plus
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court if we get there um and
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
so we were trying and the court even
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
said in their decision there may be a
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislative remedy to this here here
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
here we are little hint here so what we
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
have proposed in this version of House
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 just addresses that that um
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
doubling of of hearing activity
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the SI we did not we did not
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
bring forward another sunset provision
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay so just to follow two years ago it
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
was the sunsetting of this that got
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention not what you're
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
proposing here I I think that's true
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
okay thanks and the poliy we we see you
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
know any act any decision to Sunset the
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
second injury fund we see as a policy
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
decision and for you all
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay so um what's the argument in favor
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
of having this is it that um workers who
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
have experienced previous injuries are
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
more likely to get hired than they might
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise is that kind of it I think
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
that that is a good characterization of
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
the original purpose however I would
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
also say that we now live in a world
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
that has an Americans with Disabilities
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
Act um and so a hiring honestly a hiring
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
decision really should not be made on
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
this basis in my in my opinion gotta
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay um any other thoughts here yeah I'm
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
to get rid of busy work you know what I
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
mean that you know make work kind of
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
stuff and this sounds like a case where
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
if we got rid of the whole thing
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
insurance rates would actually be lower
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
right because there'd be less work
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
involved in getting them there right
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the the industry is better
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
able to answer that um I think the the
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
national Clearing House on on
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
compensation data uh probably will have
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
an opinion about that but on its face
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're charging the industry for
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
15% um I
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
see well but do you charge them
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
less what do you mean by the total the
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of claims that are paid we
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
determined the amount of claims that are
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
that are compensable under the program
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
MH and then we build the industry for it
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
right and you add 15% for yourself and
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
we had and we had 15% right okay how
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
many employees are in the department to
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
handle this there there is one full-time
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
labor grade 25 that works on this
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
program exclusively
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
um that we commit time and the director
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
of the division commits time
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
um sure sure I mean in total there as
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner explained there's one
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
primary staff person whose sole
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to essentially
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
administer to the program there are
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
several letter levels of vetting on the
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement applications that occur to
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
assure that the mathematical
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
calculations are correct and without
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
error um so in total staff persons who
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
work on the program with the caveat that
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
not all of them are fully dedicated to
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
that program it's it's four or five it
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
includes the director of worker workers
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
compensation division's time because um
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
he signs off on that individual signs
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
off on all reimbursement approvals as
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
the as the final um person saying that
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
it's it's satisfactory uh to to be
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so total five to six people
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
with one full time dedicated okay so it
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
sounds like if we're talking
 
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.470 align:start position:0%
sounds like if we're talking
um1

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
um1
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
million times 15% you're
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
collecting um whatever um one and A5
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
million or or more is that kind of right
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh and only 16 current current value of
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
the program is about 16 million it's
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
been as high as 22 million um uh
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
so yes however the balance it doesn't
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
you know we don't put it in our pocket
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
or anything yeah but but no I'm I'm
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to what you're not spending comes
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund no different
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
fund oh okay different fund this this
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
fund is it's a true revolving fund and
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
the balance that's remaining as of March
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
1st I believe the balance remaining as
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
of March 1st rolls forward to depress
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the commitment so so it always
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
remains even the 15% always remains in
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
the fund I see so you charge some
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
expenses against the fund no no no no
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
expenses are charged to this fund at all
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
other than the claims
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
paid okay I see all right um yeah so I'd
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
be yes represent I was just I was trying
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
to understand what the um the um people
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
who were opposing getting rid of the
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
fund what their opposition
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
was I'll let them characterize okay well
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
I maybe someone I just don't understand
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
the opposition because it seems worth
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
sunting well I just remember at certain
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
points people telling me um well the
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
state's making money on this right
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
because we're we have people who are
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
insured and some we put in claims and
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
and but when I talked to das they said
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
well you know some years we make money
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
and some years we don't right you know
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
because some years their claims are high
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're not you know so
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman I can comment on that as
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
well uh our staff person has been
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the state's participation in
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
this and it is a mixed bag um uh two
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
years ago we we the state as an employer
 
00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:24.430 align:start position:0%
years ago we we the state as an employer
lost

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and the most recent two years
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
we have gained uh nearly 200 and then a
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
bit more than 200,000 but it's a mixed
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
bag it depends on the claims it depends
 
00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:38.519 align:start position:0%
on depends on how many claims the state
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
is paying because that'll determine our
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
assessment you know how how much will
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
the labor department charge the state
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
for participating right and and when you
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
make a claim is there documentation of
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
various kinds oh yes sure so there's a
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
lot of work here it sounds like okay um
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
but maybe this is not
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
so what do think let's assume well I
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
don't know how many think that
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
um we should sunset this this
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
fund um so that's what I think but I'm
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
feeling of sunsetting okay but but maybe
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
this should be a bill right is that the
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
the thought then it'll go to the labor
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee and all the sort of stuff
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
right because it's not affecting our
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
budget right so maybe we should pass
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
this part to help him out with the legal
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of it but make it a bill for
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
next time right does that make
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
sense huh yeah you like that idea okay
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
all right so where are we
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
here um so this is sections 140 140 and
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
I believe 141 14 address hearings
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're both the same any specific
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
sections no I don't see any all right
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative Camal yes I like to make
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept sections 140 and 141
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
I'll second it okay motion by
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cal and seconded by
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative eil to accept sections
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
140 and 141 all those in
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
favor all right unanimous very
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
good what else do we have anything any
 
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.190 align:start position:0%
good what else do we have anything any
other

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
labor no we we could talk all day if you
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
want but sure you have other
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
things so how much how much more in
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
fines are you going to give us so we can
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
balance our budget well that's that's a
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
double edged sword isn't it um um
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
because the fines come from somebody
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah we're we're going just
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
like the elevator right we're raising
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
fees and all this sort of stuff
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
understand so yeah um and and I guess we
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
decided to not change your your um
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
discretion on those kind of things right
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
but we did talk about you tend to yes
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
you were charging somebody $12.50 or
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
something I don't remember what the
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
number it's the the largest revenue in
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the restricted fund is is for fines that
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
we Levy against uh insurance carriers
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
for late reporting of coverage events
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
and um yes the the statute allows us to
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
charge up to $50 a day and we we are
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
currently our our rubric says $112 a day
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah so we would appreciate it
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
if you consider $20 a day or what you
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
know some some other number carriers
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
might not I understand all
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah they might get to be more on
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
time so okay any other things for the
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner no we're happy thank you
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
very much okay thank
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
you to vote on
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
137 we're going to wait till we get the
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
the handout right or do you want to vote
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
on it now no we have to amend it and
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
to Mr chair the language right so I
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually looked up the fees Maine is at
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
$50 and Vermont has an array if it's an
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
electric traction elevator and escalator
 
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.109 align:start position:0%
electric traction elevator and escalator
it's

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
250 um residential elevators and
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
stairway chair lifts are 100
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
so I think 75 is very reasonable
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay um I guess since we're here why
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't we vote on it right okay who's
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
C3 okay any second second second from
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin all right so
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're voting on raising the elevator fee
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
to $75 on section one and accepting
 
00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
to $75 on section one and accepting
section

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
137 all those in
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
favor okay good unanimous with
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney absent okay
 
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.109 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney absent okay
good

00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
now do we have somebody new who came to
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
something we have um J Bucky from
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
judicial Council here say that again Jay
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
Bucky from judicial council is here oh
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council yes welcome
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
and section 125 to
 
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
and section 125 to
127

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
morning right so we are on let's see
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
here 125 I think right
 
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.710 align:start position:0%
here 125 I think right
section

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
125 line
 
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.390 align:start position:0%
125 line
17

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
um so what is it um that's being asked
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
for here what's what's the change I
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
reenacted I'm sorry representative I
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
mine doesn't have a line number my my
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
sheet I'm looking at so um adequate
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
representation for Indigent defendants
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
in criminal cas cases um RSA 604a col 6
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
is repealed and reenacted as follows yes
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you apologies the intent behind
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill uh is to essentially rework
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
and streamline the payment uh for
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
services other than Council in indent
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
defense cases um the current system was
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
put in place uh when there are many
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
fewer uh services that were required and
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know over time thank you so
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
much the the frequency and the nature of
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
these Services is really grown
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
exponentially for example um I think
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
when when this uh original statutory
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
framework was adopted these Services
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
would only be requested in a small
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
minority of cases where a signed Council
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
was appointed and something like an
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
expert like a a ballistics expert was
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
requested and so it would require a
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
judge to look at the request and you
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
know these would be rare and the judge
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
would look review it sign off on it send
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
it back to us and this is all done using
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
the mail these days um there's a lot
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
more assigned Council using these uh
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
types of requests and also the Nature
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
has changed quite substantially so now
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
we have uh translation bills coming
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
through and those aren't really uh
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
controversial or large but they're
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
voluminous and they still have to go
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
through this process where they get
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
mailed around to different courts and
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
that takes up court time judge time and
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
it goes through several different steps
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
we've been working on other workarounds
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
to um streamline this using
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
administrative orders but a statutory
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
change is envisioned to really cut down
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the number of people have to look at
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
these and just to speed up reliability
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
and um efficiency I I brought a prop if
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see it just to show the
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
current number of steps it takes to have
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
a bill approved in our state two two
 
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.069 align:start position:0%
a bill approved in our state two two
props

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
um we had a lean group just to look at
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
the original way that we approved this
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
is just translation bills the number of
 
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.630 align:start position:0%
is just translation bills the number of
steps

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
steps
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
involved the number of people it took to
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
get one bill approved I see was
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
remarkable and so each box is a person
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
doing something yes okay either a step
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
or a person and it goes across lawyers
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
the courts and my office and um a lot of
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
these are done through the mail which is
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
another uh issue so the goal is there to
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
to Really reduce the number of cases
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
where a judge has to look at a bill you
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
know keep that for the high dollar um
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
discretionary types of things and
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
everything else would go through my
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
office for review but not um the level
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
of review that gets
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
brought and so you decided high dollar
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
is $1,500 is yes okay um all
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
right and are all of these three parts
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
of the same thing or they
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
different the other two are similar so
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
the other provision has to do with
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
Council fees and that's the same idea
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
essentially basically right now um
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
unless there's an administrative order
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
and there are some administrative orders
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
that have been issued to deal with this
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
but this would essentially make it so
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
that in any case where a lawyer does
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
work on an Indigent defense case and
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
they come in under the presumptive fee
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
cap which is set by the Supreme Court
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
then that bill would be forwarded to us
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
instead of for a judge to review because
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine judges and Court
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
staff spend a lot of time getting lawyer
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
bills which are not extraordinary
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
looking at them and then sending them to
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
us and that slows down the whole process
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
and also just makes it more difficult
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
for people to get paid in a reliable and
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
timely manner so that's what that the
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
um 604 A4 that's related to compensation
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
of council same idea streamlining that
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
process and having basically a threshold
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
over which bills would get judicial
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
review okay and 604 A6 the recommended
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
change there is to expand the areas
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
where the judicial Council can contract
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
with providers right now we can only
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
contract with certain limited types and
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
my hope there is that by being able to
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
contract with a wider array of providers
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
we could try to you use some of the
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
leverage that the state has and
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate more favorable rates in terms
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
of translation services um evaluations
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
all the sorts of things that come up
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
fairly regularly um but right now we
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
just pay you know the state pays them
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
all on a one-off basis instead of
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Contracting in bulk gotcha so you could
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
either hire somebody or just have a a
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
rate that's agreed on ahead of time yeah
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
exactly okay very good other questions
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Ms
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
you for coming in again and I'm sorry if
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
I missed this in your uh in your
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
discussion but on page
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
57 um at the top uh Roman numeral three
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
where it says the executive director of
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
the Jud judicial Council May upon review
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
decline to process inv what is that
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
again is that basically saying
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
that that if an in that that you make
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
the determination whether it goes to the
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
administrative judge
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
or that's designed I didn't follow that
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
oh of course that's designed as a as a a
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
fail safe because we do review the bills
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
prior to payment so if we got in a bill
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
and it was flagged that hey this bill
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't look quite right or we think
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's duplicative of another bill that's
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
already been submitted we would then
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
tell the attorney this actually has to
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
go to a judge we're not going to we're
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
not going to review it at the judicial
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
Council we're going to send this to the
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
court for review um so it's designed to
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
allow that flexibility in a case where
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
we think a bill is either mistaken or
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
for some other reason um
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
problematic okay questions
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't really have a
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
question I have more of a comment it
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me with the challenges that the
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
judicial council is facing in general
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
any thing that we can do to help them
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
streamline the process should save money
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
and and time so I'd be in favor of um uh
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
approving these sections okay anybody
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
else want to representative cell I'll
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
second that motion okay all right
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
consider that emotion all right so
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative eel moves and
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative cell seconds that we
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
accept sections 125 through 127 of House
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 any further discussion all right
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
all those in
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
favor all right unanimous
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
excellent I wanted to ask you one
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
question while you're here um one thing
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about is um the
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
distinction between a misdemeanor and a
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
felony and um so we understand when it's
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
when it's something stolen or whatever
 
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.510 align:start position:0%
when it's something stolen or whatever
it's

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and maybe that ,000 was set a
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
very long time
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
ago um so would it how would it affect
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
if we change that to $2,000 or some
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
other number how would that affect your
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
your judicial
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
Council the fewer to answer broadly and
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
then to go more
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
specific felony is more expensive both
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
in times of time and also money for us
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with um the average cost for a
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
felony um is several High Times Higher
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
Than for a misdemeanor when paid through
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
a signed Council and again there's
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
different ways that we handle cases
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
public Defender contract and assigned um
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
for the average felony it's as I
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times higher the fewer
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
felonies that go that that are assigned
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
that brings down cost so if a if a
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
felony is not charged a felony but
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
instead comes forward as a misdemeanor
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's much more it's much less costly
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
part of that is due to just the amount
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
of litigation that's involved in a
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
felony a felony has um many more Court
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
hearings also the stakes are higher and
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
often times the discovery is more
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
voluminous um but even if not just the
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
number of steps that there are in a
 
00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:00.559 align:start position:0%
felony case just takes longer attorney
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
has to come to each one of those the
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
person has to come um so depending on
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
what the number you look at depending on
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
how that case is handled um the average
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
cost just to give some some rough
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
numbers the average cost for an assigned
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
felony is roughly
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
$1,500 the average cost for an assigned
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
felony is $6,500 so it's several times
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
higher um and part of that factor of
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
four yeah again that's average not Med
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
the me those numbers are are quite
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
different um because certain cases for
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
example cases that go to trial cost much
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
more than a case that resolves early on
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
but that can give a rough idea of um
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
those cases speaks specifically to um
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
thefts uh the data I had basically
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
indicated that class B thefts which
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
would Encompass the current $1,000 to
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
$1,500 Benchmark about 47 a month in the
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
I will note though that class B thefts
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
can also be Class B thefts because of
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
value and because of other factors or
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
some other um thefts like third strike
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
thefts that would fall into that so
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
depending on I don't have the data that
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
would break it down on any given
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
Benchmark where that would be how many
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know how many thefts are charged
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
1,00 to 1500 versus 1500 to 2,000 I I
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't have that I could I could probably
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
get get it for you know a specific time
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
period but um overall a felon is more
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
expensive than a misdemeanor um and a
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
very serious felony is more expensive
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
than uh a regular felony I I I've just
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
talked about regular felony bills
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
certain bills such as um aggravated flon
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
sexual assault death resulting cases
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
murder um you know any the very very
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
serious crimes those cost more than a
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
regular felony sure um so you don't know
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
how many um I guess the fraction of your
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
work that's due to theft in particular
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
or cases where this would be turn on a a
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
money amount you see what I mean
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
certainly my estimate would be roughly
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
20 a month 20 a month out of a 100
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
months out of out of how many does the
 
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
months out of out of how many does the
judicial

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
Council cover on average in a month all
 
00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:18.559 align:start position:0%
cases I would have to I'm sorry I have
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
to go and and look that up I apologize I
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
have data per year i' have to all right
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:36.309 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
and are
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
you just to clarify you're speaking
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
specifically of criminal cases yes yeah
 
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:58.270 align:start position:0%
specifically of criminal cases yes yeah
yeah

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you this is Suzanne kerson from
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
the public defender um had this data
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
more at hand I want to give a a caveat
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
the public defender
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
has a better way of tracking individual
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
cases than the judicial Council
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
currently because our system is in the
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
process of being overhauled and they
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
handle the bulk of the criminal defense
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
cases in the state so we handle cases on
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
top of this but to give an idea of the
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
number of cases it's 22,000 cases and
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
that incp is as I think we talked before
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
charges dockets and that can include
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
anything from Felony misdemeanor
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
probation violations parole hearings
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
sentencing hearings motions to impose um
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
all those sorts of things so 20 cases is
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
nothing right I mean 20 cases a month
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's 4 four 500 a year right I mean
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 250 a year and uh compared to
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
22,000 right this is like a little more
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
than 1% it's it's not a I will say that
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
obviously a felony because of the way
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
because of the structure felony is is is
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
more if it was for review hearings right
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
right but um
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
now I would assume most of these things
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
are somebody steals a car is that kind
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
of it um and maybe there's hardly any
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
difference between a car worth a th000
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
and a car worth 2,000 right I mean it's
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
every car is going to be a $55,000 thing
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
or something like that is it most most
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
cars are are charged that way unless
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a particularly unwanted car yeah
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right so again this is probably
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
a bill not a not a hb2 thing but
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah so um
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
just I was digging into this article
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
that you're so sick of me um mentioning
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I found
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
interesting in the in the article that
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
was reviewing the Indigent defense uh
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
crisis was that there was um an a
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
program a clinical type program at
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce that the judicial
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
Council had gotten funding for they
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
cleared 323 cases in nine months and
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
apparently it was a really good program
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
so I asked Mr Bucky um if he thought it
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
would be worthwhile pursuing this again
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
and you can so I will I will ask you the
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
question but before and then you can
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the monies but before we get
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
too far uh it's like under
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and they cleared massive
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
numbers I mean I anyway go ahead Mr
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
Bucky thank you um yes there is a
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
program that was funded by federal funds
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the last bium which was quite
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
successful in recruiting um new lawyers
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
to take Indigent defense cases um the
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
judicial Council uh I in my role I would
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
strongly support refunding that program
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
for a couple different reasons one one
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the effects of that program was to
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
there's two two main effects first it
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
took attorneys who were
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
either coming to a new practice area so
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
experienced attorneys who were starting
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
to take criminal cases or attorneys out
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
of law school who were looking to really
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
become proficient in specific New
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire criminal case work and it
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
achieved both of those goals and from a
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh societal Viewpoint that was great
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
because it brought in new attorneys
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
taking these cases from a very um
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
numbers and sense point of view from
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
from my role we were able to use that
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
program and leverage it to uh convince
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
people to say if you did this program
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
you had to commit to taking a certain
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
number of indent defense cases um and
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful for us because it
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
gave us several new lawyers they all
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
committed to taking these cases and they
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
and they took the cases and that was
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
great and now several of those attorneys
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
still take cases because they have a a
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
network of people who they you know
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
through the program they had mentorship
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
just in I can tell you that uh in
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting attorneys generally one of
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
the major barriers to have an attorney
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
take these cases is who am I going to
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
talk to if I have a question is there
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
some Network um because if someone wants
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
to you know if I'm a real estate
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
attorney and I would like to take an
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
ninine in defense case I'm not going to
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
do that unless I feel like I can do a
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
good job you know people we don't want
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
them to take those cases unless they
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable doing that so this this
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
sort of a model where we can offer
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
training as an inducement to take cases
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
um is powerful because a you know gives
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
training but B it's sort of a cost-
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
effective way of having folks take cases
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't ordinarily do them
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
gotta yeah just to follow up I mean we
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
talked about it um a little bit and
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we could get a firmer number from
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Bucky but apparently there's already
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
a counting unit in here in hb1 that we
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
could add some funds to but they would
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
be um no I know you're raising your
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
eyebrows but you know when you look at
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
the overall scheme of things um uh it's
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
and I actually I also talked to Melissa
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
about it it's a minimal amount of money
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
I think to clear 323 or 400 cases in a
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
year and it would help the judicial
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
Council a lot where it's already deeply
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
underfunded so it seemed to me like a
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
very lowcost
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
alternative so are you saying shifting
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
that money from a different judicial
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
Council account no I didn't say that I
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was I thought it was um if if
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is a better way to get cases
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
through than the other way right well
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
and we can we can talk about that but
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
um let let's I just really wanted to
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
raise the option as a way of moving
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
cases through in a much less expensive
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
way okay thank you representative run
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um while you're here
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you your thoughts on the
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
young adult Court um there's been a
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
pilot that's been running in Manchester
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
where um uh people that are between the
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
ages of 18 and 25 I think that have been
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
charged I believe with their first
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
offense they um they go through a
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
special Court there's some case
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
management but there's I don't know if
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
there's evidence but um there's
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
indications that it would actually save
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
in the long run because it reduces
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
recidivism of this population and it
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
also enables them to get into um a
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
lifestyle or career choices where they
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
can be independent and contribute to
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
society taxes services whatever um
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
what's your experience been if any with
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
that pilot in Manchester I haven't been
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
involved with that pilot specifically
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
that young adult Court I will say that
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
generally um one of the things the
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
public defender does as part of their
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
mission is they staff um treatment
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
courts throughout the state and one area
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
my experience as an attorney was I was
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
involved in helping to create the the
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
drug court in Chester County I was part
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee that got it going more
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
than 10 years ago um I didn't establish
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
it myself personally but I had the
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
experience getting that Court going and
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
I I do think that as a
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
long-term someone's willing to take a
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
long-term view those courts are
 
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely worth it I think if you have
 
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.670 align:start position:0%
absolutely worth it I think if you have
experience

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
seeing the results uh especially on
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
someone who you know goes from not being
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
a productive member of society maybe
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um especially if that
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
person has a family taking that person
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
and putting resources up front to help
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
that person really turn things around
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
huge difference and that has obviously
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
ripples across the family across the
 
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
community um but it is it it's a time um
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term view one area that I
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
would uh I'm eager to speak with about
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
anybody but in the judicial Council
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
especially right now we're in a
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
situation where because um you the
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
public defender it's budget is set every
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
two years the money that it gets upfront
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
is important because it helps it to
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
recruit and plan for the future
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
currently we're in a situation where the
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
public defender is the only defense
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
organization that really staff strug
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
courts across the state you know because
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
they're in every County um if that
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen um I don't think there's
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
a way for us to really staff those
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
courts through other contract or
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
assigned means or if we did it would be
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
at a much higher rate um and one thing
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm encountering currently uh is
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
that because of limits on the public
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
defender capacity we're having to use
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
more contract and assigned Council so
 
00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:43.039 align:start position:0%
just to get to this idea that the money
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
upfront for organizations like treatment
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
judicial account excuse me public
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
defender really goes a long way um in
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
reducing the long-term costs because the
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
less money that goes towards a public
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
defender the more money comes up
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately for assign counsel contract
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
counsel because those bills have to be
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
paid constitutionally and I have to pay
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
them one way or another so just to to
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
link that issue uh to the ongoing issue
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
the public defender the public defender
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
I think supports it I support the
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
treatment courts they're important I've
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
seen their effect um but they do cost
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
money and that's money that needs to be
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
paid generally upfront because they have
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
front right any other questions
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil so um Melissa I'm if
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
we decided that we wanted to pursue this
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is it would just
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
need an amendment to hb1 and not just in
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
terms of adding more funding to it and
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
yes we correct that's correct we could
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
do two things we would get the um class
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
line from Mr bakia where the 100,000
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
would be added and we also can put in a
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
footnote if you'd like to say the
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
directive of what the 100,000 should be
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
going towards
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
um he told me it was what did you say
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
1091 the accounting unit 1091 and the
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
class I believe is 27 for
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
training well all right I'm Mr chair I I
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
I would like to pursue an amendment for
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
this and then we could talk about it now
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
or talk about it later uh later please
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
but yes okay I'll prepare one good all
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
right other questions for judicial
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
councel no all right well thank you so
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
much for coming thank you all right so I
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
think that's the end of this page right
 
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.510 align:start position:0%
think that's the end of this page right
page

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
three yeah yes
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
represent oh we have still have
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.190 align:start position:0%
represent oh we have still have
something

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
open oh represent run oh I just wanted
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
to mention that I heard back from the
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
executive director of New Hampshire
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
Lakes regarding that decal program oh
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
yes and she had a conversation I think
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
this morning with uh Mr deer at Dees and
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
and she's now supports the repeal of
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
that because even though it um it is
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
making a little bit of money it's not
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
accounting for the administration
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that the
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
department has um in just the auxiliary
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
support of that so when we if you do
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to get to that yeah we we let's do
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
that in in a moment okay so what was 155
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
we're holding on oh that was Revenue
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
sharing Revenue sharing oh
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
good so I'm finally in the majority so I
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
can make a my own motion here all right
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
65

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
65
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
so I again I think this is It's been
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
suspended for a minimum of um uh 15
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
years or something like that and it's um
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
18 years is that what we decided 2007 or
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
2009 2009 2009 okay so so it's 16 years
 
01:00:16.039 --> 01:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
2009 2009 2009 okay so so it's 16 years
and

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's really full of all this uh
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
Antiquated stuff like the fur bearing
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
animals and all that kind of thing so so
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to move that we replace
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
section 155 with a straightup repeal of
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
RSA 31- a I'll second that motion okay
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative um just as I
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
said before when we were talking about
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
this I I I realize that the statute as
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
it is now is um not constructed
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
beautifully it could be revised I
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
personally under the the situation that
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're in with property taxes already I
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
would have a very hard time telling my
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
constituents that I supported the repeal
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
of this Revenue sharing provision
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
because um I just don't think it's
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I'll be opposing the
 
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
motion okay anybody else represent R I
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
will also be opposing it I I agree with
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative eel that we could
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably go into that and make some
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
improvements as far far as the revenue
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
sourcing to be sh to be shared but I
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
know my constituents in miramac are um
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
really stretched with property taxes and
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
I I have the personal belief that the
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
state should be sharing more of our
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue with our with granite Staters
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
and relieving the burden that they have
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
we have we have elderly people that have
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
to sell their homes one woman had to
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
sell her car just to pay her property
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
taxes and um I I I just don't believe
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
the repeal is in
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
order okay representative
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire yes than thank you I agree that
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
it will be taken badly by a lot of
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
people who think that this statute is
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
actually in
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
effect but the people that know that it
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
has been suspended every budget for the
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
last nine or 10 of
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
them AR it doesn't matter we could
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
replace it by instead of repealing it
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
just by saying that we we intend to
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
share Revenue with the towns and
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities you know see other
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
sections or whatever because that
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
particular statute is totally Obsolete
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and having been suspended it it just
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
makes the the uninformed will look at it
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
and say oh we're going to get 30% of the
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms revenue or whatever yeah
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
and and then get bitterly disappointed
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't happened yeah and every
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
budget since I've been in the house has
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm in favor of of repealing it
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
rather than suspending it because resp
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
suspending it seems to imply that we
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
support the that section as opposed to
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
saying we support sharing Revenue with
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
the the municipalities
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
just to slightly clarify the the rooms
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
of meals sharing is in some other
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
section right it's not in the here right
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
we're we're not talking about that
 
01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you Mr chair and
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for um letting
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives Eble and rung go before
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
me so I can say ditto ditto um I um I
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
also will be voting against this um and
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
uh I agree that it's um it's not worded
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
as elegantly as it could be um but I
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
think it just sends a a a a bad message
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
um particularly when we're all hearing
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
that people are very concerned about
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes yeah yeah I'll just make
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
the comment that I believe in the last
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
bium we raised the um amount of adequate
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
Ed Aid something like $200 million I
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
mean it was it was a very large increase
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
so anyways representative Griffin yeah I
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to clean this up we
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
haven't done it for 15 years our laws
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
are getting uh larger and larger and
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
larger the volumes and it's really time
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
that we we look at a lot of the sections
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
that are out of date and uh repeal them
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
they can be Rel
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
legislated when the time comes if it
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
comes yeah um I remember when
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire put in a bill to
 
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:56.590 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of the ban on explosive stove
 
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.589 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of the ban on explosive stove
[Laughter]

01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
polish things like that anyways
 
01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:02.190 align:start position:0%
polish things like that anyways
representative

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
Le thanks Mr chairman I guess kind of a
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
piggyback on our newest member of the
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
division this is like a false narrative
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
that this is available and we haven't
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
used it since 2009 so we really aren't
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
taking anything away because there's
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
nothing to give and a lot of the laws
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
that tax laws that exist under the
 
01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
statute have now been vacated so It
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
Seems like by suspending it people say
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
oh they've suspended Revenue sharing
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
well we really haven't we haven't used
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
this since 2009 so I'll be supporting
 
01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
this since 2009 so I'll be supporting
removing

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
155 all right thank you so any other
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%

thank you very much yes represent R the
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
vote we just took was that on 155 or an
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to repeal it it's an amendment
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
still be 155 but it'll instead of saying
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%

oh since your wife here yeah what's that
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
oh barbering yeah no do we want to take
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
this how about this $10 million
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
section8 by the way I had some sort of
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
good news this morning um which was that
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
I had been thinking the amount we had to
 
01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
I had been thinking the amount we had to
cut

01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
cut
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
um uh had all didn't includ didn't
 
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.430 align:start position:0%
um uh had all didn't includ didn't
include

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
the the um slot machine money right so
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking that we had to cut uh
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
to balance the budget like $770 million
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
right but it turns out if we accept the
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
slot machine money that's an extra
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
whatever off that that money you see
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
mean so right so it's only 600 million
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
instead of but you know those things
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
count right so
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
every little bit counts yeah so so
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
anyway so to me that's good news maybe
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
not to everybody but anyways so all
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
right let's go on to this one so this
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
one is section 188 this is um a $10
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
million raid on the uh renewable energy
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
fund which
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
um uh again is is a big deal to balance
 
01:09:21.799 --> 01:09:22.749 align:start position:0%
um uh again is is a big deal to balance
the

01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
budget um and I believe it is sort of on
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
our Surplus statement yeah represent
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
McGuire yes um I would say that since
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
the house passed a
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
bill last week to rebate it to the
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
consumers I would say you want to make
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
sure your 10 million comes out before
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
they start doing
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
that I mean and you can do that by
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
checking your effective dates but
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
um if you want the 10 million make they
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
start dealing out pennies to every rate
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
payer in the state yeah so there's a
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Crossing issue because
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't come to us it's going
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
to Ways and Means and so I I guess I
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we should wait and I'll speak to
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and see what what they
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
plan to do with it yes represent R um my
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
understanding from talking to someone on
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
um Science and Tech is that this section
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
may be illegal because that 10 million
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
is a that's in a dedicated fund the
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund so if the money is
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
taken out it needs to go back to the
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
rate payers not the general fund because
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
it has a dedicated
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
purpose yeah so that might be a question
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be to be asked yeah I mean this is
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
law here
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
so um you
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
know well I think if
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
it I I'm just wondering if there if
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a distinction to
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
repeal the fund altogether but just
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
taking money out of it to be put in the
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
general fund may not be constitutional
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
since that fund was set up for a
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
specific that the monies are supposed to
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
be used for a specific purpose so unless
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
you dissolve the fund um but I I still
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
think that um you know that that's money
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
that was put there by rate payers and
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
they should get the money
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
back so I think what you're talking
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
about is um
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a moral issue or a you know what I
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
mean a policy issue but it's not really
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
a legal issue in the sense that the law
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
created this Fund in the first place
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
right and so we can change law and we
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
can modify you know make new law and and
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't the Constitution that said
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's a renewable energy fund right it
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
was law and so this is just new law
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
basically but my understanding is that
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
the law that set up this fund restricted
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
use of the funds for specific purpose so
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
if we're now taking those funds and
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
using them for another purpose like
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
funding the general fund that that we'd
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
have to change 362 DF colon 10 to say
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
that the funds that are in this fund can
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
be can be transferred out for other
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
purposes so I think not right so in
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
general subsequent law takes precedent
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
over earlier law right so but um so so I
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
I I really don't think so anyways
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you Mr chair I I just
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
want to take a step back and and and
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
really advocate for you know not
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
removing this money from the um from the
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund I mean the the
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is one of the few
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
remaining uh tools that we have to try
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
to um get us off the um Reliance that we
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
currently have on on natural gas um
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
which is quite frankly D what is driving
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
up the cost of energy not only in New
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also in all of New England
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
um if we really want to help rate payers
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the long term what we need to do is
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
diversify our supply of energy um and um
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
this fund was set up to do that it's
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that for at least this the
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
last several years we've had a
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy that has not been
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
um out there really encouraging
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
people to apply for the money that's in
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
this fund but um um if we take if we
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
remove this money um we are just going
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be setting ourselves back even
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
further from the goal which I think we
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
all have which is to reduce the cost of
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
energy to businesses and citizens across
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
the entire State this is a this is a a
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
in my opinion a Pennywise pound foolish
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
kind of exercise okay representative
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you with all due respect
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative Ms that position was
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
argued on the floor last week and
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
defeated and right now the status of
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
that fund is that all the contents will
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
be rebated to the rate payers and I
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
agree with representative rang's concern
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe we shouldn't be rating the
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
fund for the general fund but the intent
 
01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:52.110 align:start position:0%
fund for the general fund but the intent
is

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
that the renewable energy fund should
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
shall be used to directly reduce rates
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
in the near
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
term and that that was the house
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
position that we established all right
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
so all right representative leishman and
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll move
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
on so I won't support as the chair said
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
raiding this fund but the chair is
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely right you hear people often
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
say you're breaking the laws but as a
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
chair is often known to say we write the
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
laws so I think the chair is correct we
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
can certainly take the money but I don't
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
agree with it okay thank you so um I
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be doing more with
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
possibly doing more with dedicated funds
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things on our list
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so maybe when we get a day to just
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
for all those things then we'll come
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
back to this one as well maybe that's
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it all right now that
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
we have representative Maguire here
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we should talk about barbering and
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
com cosmetology
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
um we're we're sort of waiting to hear
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
from oplc right yes but that's I can
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
tell you what the point is please do all
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
right there's two different uh sections
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
here one takes the
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
inspectors the mechanical inspectors and
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
the uh Electric electrical inspectors
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
gasfitters and so forth and take them
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
out of the oplc and move them to the
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's Office in the department
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
of safety because they work to some
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
extent they work for the Fire
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
Marshall and they are there for the
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
safety of all installations in the state
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're not really a licensing function
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
yeah that that we've moved to division
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
two oh and I believe they've accepted it
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
so okay so let's talk about barbering
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
barbering okay barberism or there's a
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll do a trim on that one
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
joke which is worse than a bad joke for
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the most part okay so regarding the
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
barbering it includes a definition of
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
shop which is useful because it's
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
referenced all throughout the statute
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
change the inspection requirements which
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
are currently in statute as at least
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
once per year per
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
shop the oplc and most of the people
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the business think that's
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
excessive the intent is to make it so
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
that there is an inspection upon initial
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
or if there is an investigation or a
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
need to get
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
involved um we discuss that in Edna and
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
we all think that's
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
perfectly a perfectly reasonable change
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
the other change is that the governor
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
had with the help of oplc has found
 
01:18:17.199 --> 01:18:19.229 align:start position:0%
had with the help of oplc has found
a

01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
federal um osip training on Sanitation
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
for Barbers and
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists so the intent is to tell
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
The Barbers and cosmetology the shop
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
owners that if you have a this
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
certificate and this training we won't
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
won't inspect you again unless there's
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
an issue which will save everybody a lot
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
of time and
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
trouble and Edna is fine with that the
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
trouble is that the language that's
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
given in House Bill 2 doesn't exactly
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
reflect that intention very well and
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's what the oplc is rewriting it in
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
order to uh properly address the issue
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
it um there's also a requirement that
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
schools have the same inspection
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
requirements as shops which is everybody
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
agreed that's only appropriate so
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the it's a mild change to the inspection
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
requirements but um it makes sense it'll
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
save every everybody time in trouble but
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
you need to have the right language so
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
that it goes into the right pieces of
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
Statute okay so we can't approve it as
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
is no now the um excuse me
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
repres represent I agree with you 100%
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire um and then the
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
other thing that's in this section is um
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
the number of hours required for for
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
licensing I believe it's a minimum of,
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
1500 hours of training there is Senate
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 194 to reduce that to 1,200 hours
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know the status of that
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
because would we have to make that it
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
has not yet gotten to the house so it's
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
not the house position oh okay uh I
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
could certainly this will be um when
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's Rewritten it'll be a clarification
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
of of the intent when we get that Senate
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill I'll make it which will almost
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
certainly be coming to Edna I'll make
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
sure goes into effect after house bill
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
to so that it overrides the number of
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
hours okay good thank
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
you um other comments so it sounds like
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're not quite ready at this
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
point okay good so should we go back to
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
page one see if there's anything we can
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
get rid of
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
here uh Bale I guess we're still waiting
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.180 align:start position:0%
on that
one

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:49.190 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:50.669 align:start position:0%
one
[Music]

01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
um what about the endangered species
 
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.470 align:start position:0%
um what about the endangered species
stuff

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.709 align:start position:0%
stuff
that's

01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:00.350 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
all
um

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry I if this is the if those
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
are all the per oh this is the ones
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for the public hearing
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I feel like we should wait for the
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing there's lots of interest
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
in that on all of these things right and
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
then the the um site evaluation
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee section I think we also really
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
owe it to folks to wait okay all right
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that's all that
 
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.910 align:start position:0%
so that's all that
stuff

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so I made a deal with the group
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
two guys that on Friday we would spend
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
an hour with them and they can make
 
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.149 align:start position:0%
an hour with them and they can make
their

01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
pitch uh for this section I'm you know
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
as I said yesterday I'm I'm very uh
 
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
reluctant and and especially on parts of
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
it but they're going to come sometime
 
01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
it but they're going to come sometime
on

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Friday um so can we schedule them maybe
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
1:15 would that work yep that's what we
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
have told J it to schedule it at 1:15
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do bills in we'll do our new bills
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the morning and then we'll do the
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
group two at 1:5 for an hour at 2:15 and
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
then at 2:15 we'll pick up the rest of
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
the bills if we haven't gone through
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
them or we'll do some more AG or bud bud
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
work yeah okay Mr chair yes repres is
 
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion on the
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system can we is there any
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
chance and I I don't know if the timing
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
works but is there any chance we can get
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
an accurate estimate of the cost impact
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
of what's in hb2 from the New Hampshire
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
retirement system because they they've
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
IND they indicated in their testimony
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
that it's less than what the governor
 
01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.950 align:start position:0%
that it's less than what the governor
has

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
proposed again assuming it's a 10e spend
 
01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
proposed again assuming it's a 10e spend
right

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah rep
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
Melissa we have reached out to them on
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not entirely sure if we
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
would get it by Friday I don't know if
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
they have to send it back to the actuary
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
because the ACT what the actuary does is
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
look at what was in the bill and does
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
the analysis based on that um but it's
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
an open item that we have with them
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to get something
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
Friday okay we can invite retirement in
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
like so so just um I don't know if
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire was a where but
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
when we talked to the retirement system
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
about this section um they said that it
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
would lower the unfunded liability so
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes because they told us the same thing
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
because the governor rounded up when she
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
put in her funding requirements okay so
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
um do you have a sense
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
of if the UN if you want the unfunded
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
liability to go down by a million do how
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
much you have to uh spend per year in
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
general you have if you want to put a
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars in today that'll lower
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability by a
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
million right so if she's doing it over
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
10 years right so if you want to lower
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
it by a million
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's 100,000 or a little
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
more okay every year every year right
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
and so we heard that the unfunded
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
liability was going down by 98 million
 
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.070 align:start position:0%
liability was going down by 98 million
okay

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
so um so divide by 10
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
roughly okay the actuaries will have
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
detailed numbers but generally that's
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
kind of how it works okay so that's a
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal right we're talking
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
about 10 million a year
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
difference off of the 56 million or
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
whatever this is right so yeah yeah
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
okay whatever the
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
um the unfunded liability CH is
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
recalculated every every year at least
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
every year based on the investment
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
returns and the um and how much goes
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
into it and all and also all legislative
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
changes and we have a whole bunch of
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that are going to be
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
debated this
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
week okay
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.119 --> 01:25:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
right
okay

01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
stuff um so generally speaking so
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're going to have our our
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
public hearing um Friday we have bills
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
and that sort of stuff um we're rapidly
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
running out of time for the whole budget
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
the our deadline is uh two weeks from
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is the last time to act right
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
so we're talking
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
about um what four meetings next week
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and another two or three the
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
following week so so about
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
seven maybe six or seven more meetings
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's enough time to to
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
get into all this this kind of
 
01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.669 align:start position:0%
get into all this this kind of
thing

01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:26:27.679 --> 01:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
thing
um

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
the so I don't
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
know maybe we should just call it a day
 
01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
know maybe we should just call it a day
for
