District 4 and proud to be a member of
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
the transportation uh Committee in the

Senate but also the Energy natural
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
resources committee uh which actually
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
had this bill instead of Transportation
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
this time around I'm introducing Senate
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
Bill 13 relative to recovery of search
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
and rescue expenses at the request of
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
the fishing game
 
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh commission to permit the Division of
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles to suspend a revoke a
 
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
driver's license when that driver has
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
failed to make payment to the fish and
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
game department for the reasonable costs
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
of a search and rescue for which they're
 
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
found to be negligent now let me know
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
that already an RSA
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
206 26 BB
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
so in-state stature we already gave the
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
authority to fish and game
 
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
authority to fish and game
um

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
to build a search and rescue
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
operator you know operation and um then
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
if the if the payment is not there the
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
vision game is given under that
 
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.189 align:start position:0%
vision game is given under that
provision

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh the suspension of a driver's license
 
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
if they're unable to collect the fees so
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's in statute but it was determined
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
that we needed to do this two things
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
first you'll see that the bill adds a
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
language that says now just a side of
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
notify we have to certify
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh to someone that this request is being
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
made that's a higher bar which I think
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and it sets forth a
 
00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
process you'll see in the bill about
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
notification about possible appeals
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
about information provision as requested
 
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
by the person who's might be subject to
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
the suspension so I think that's that's
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
all good in terms of transparency in
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
setting a bar because you know this is a
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
a kind of a last resort for the
 
00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 align:start position:0%
Department to need to take this kind of
 
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
action to collect those outstanding
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
costs for search and rescue operation
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
it also became determined that well yes
 
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 align:start position:0%
we had this Authority for fish and game
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
but we didn't have the appropriate
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
Authority in-state statutes so that yeah
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
then the DMV could take action on that
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see in the last
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the bill is to kind of
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
button that up to say the request can be
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
made here's the process and then
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
um there's the authority of DMV to do it
 
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
we have Lieutenant Mancini here from
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
fish and game department
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
um but let me just talk a little bit
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
about the the background here I mean I
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
was on Fish and Game in the house for a
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
couple terms and we were dealing this
 
00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
couple terms and we were dealing this
issue

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
um you know back 15 16 years ago and
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with it I think in very good
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
ways in the years since about the
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
problems of search and rescue operations
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
these can be extraordinarily expensive
 
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
they can involve helicopters they can
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
put the lives of our conservation
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
offices and other people at Great risk
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
especially in the wintertime trying to
 
00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
especially in the wintertime trying to
find

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
um you know what may be a negligent uh
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
negligent hiker and a number of years
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
ago was getting to the point that this
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
self-funded department was having to
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
essentially take money away from other
 
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
kinds of you know necessary operations
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
Department because of this burgeoning
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
debt over very expensive fishing game
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
search and rescue operations and so the
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
consideration was well maybe we need to
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
start adding some general fund money to
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
fish and game and we made that decision
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
to add add some but I think the real
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
stroke of of Genius here was just do the
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
hike safe card right that you can go and
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
that's it you get out just get out of
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
fear it's not get out of jail but get
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
out of fee free card and then if you
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
purchase a hike safe card
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
um which a lot of people want to do to
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to the department and its
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
operations keep our Trails safe and and
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh and so on you can do that and then if
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
you are subject to search and rescue
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
even if you're negligent you're covered
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
it's your insurance insurance policy and
 
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's been very successful programs
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
some other states have done it and
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
that's that that's a really good good
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
move but we have folks who do not buy
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
the hugsafe card
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes from you know out of state
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
and uh search and rescue operation is
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
determined that they are negligent and
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
let me say that that negligence is a
 
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
narrow category because you know people
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
get into trouble on the trails right
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's not if you slip and you you know
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
you break an angle or something like
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that um but if you're truly negligent
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be out there or in conditions
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and circumstances where any
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would think that was
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
negligence um then the fish and game
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
department decides you are subject to
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
this this charge for searching search
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
and rescue uh rescue cross but then what
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
do we do if they don't pay
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know one alternative is to
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
try to collect that money
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
um it's very expensive to try to collect
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
money from folks uh and it's also
 
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes people just you know you can't
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
get them and it just it just won't pay
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
so the one remaining tool we have in our
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
tool chest is this licensed suspension
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
um we have reciprocal arrangements with
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
other states so that if we suspend a
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
license suspended but for someone who's
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state license we can we can
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
have that uh enforced
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and so that's we're doing a variety
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
of things but it is a kind of a tool of
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
Last Resort but I I think given our
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
commitment to the fishing game
 
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
um Department
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I I really hope we can support it and
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
um transportation committee appropriate
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure look at this very
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
carefully I'm always a little anxious
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
about anything that takes away someone's
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
driving privileges because that's how
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
you get to work and other things but you
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
know we have
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
um some there's a set number I think
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
about 80 80 I think Colonel Jordan said
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
about 80 people and maybe tenant Mancini
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
will will follow up on that just the
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
numbers we're talking about

negligence who does that or do we have a
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%

uh next up Cher recognizes Bob Mancini
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:37.019 align:start position:0%
good morning chair Walsh members of the

transportation committee my name is
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Bob Mancini and I'm a
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
lieutenant over at our headquarters I
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
work directly with Colonel Jordan major
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
Walsh and Captain Eastman during my
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
career I've been a member of our search
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
and rescue team the dive team and I've
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
also had a canine
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
so over the course of those years I've
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
participated in several hundred missions
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the things I'll speak to today are
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
based on my personal experience and and
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
just the data that we've derived from
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
our databases I'm going to try to touch
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
on a few of the things that Senator
 
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.050 align:start position:0%
on a few of the things that Senator
Waters

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
went over just to offer a little bit of
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
detail but thank you Senator Waters very
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
much for for offering all of those those
 
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.750 align:start position:0%
much for for offering all of those those
facts

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
in 2022 hike safe generated 311 thousand
 
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.889 align:start position:0%
in 2022 hike safe generated 311 thousand
dollars

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:26.899 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:28.610 align:start position:0%
dollars
currently

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
right now it's generated about a hundred
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
the SAR fund which which Senator Waters
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
discussed was created in the 1980s and
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
basically what it did was a dollar from
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
boats snow machines and ohrvs was was
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
essentially put into a pool that has
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
averaged about 180 000 over the course
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
um not so much in the very beginning but
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh average over that time it has been
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
about 180 180 000 some years a little
 
00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:04.339 align:start position:0%
higher some years a little lower
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
historically our staff respond to about
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
180 search and rescue missions per year
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
during covid that was a little bit of an
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
inflated but it's historically been
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
about 180 and in that time the average
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
cost per year has been about three
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars some years
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
higher nearly 400 000 some years a
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
little lower about a quarter of a
 
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
with regards to the bills I just I wanna
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
kind of shine a little light on
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
we are not sending out a ton of bills so
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
if we if we're averaging 180 missions
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
per year in 2022 only eight bills were
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
sent out
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
in 2021 17 bills were sent out in 2020
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
15 bills so when it when we're
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
determining negligence I think
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
it is a very narrow focus and we're
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
trying to be reasonable when applying
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's negligent or not and
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's based on the field observation so
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
a lieutenant is The Incident Commander
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
on these missions and they are going to
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the colonel
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
whether whether somebody was negligent
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
in their activity and a billing memo is
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
sent up and it's included with the
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
report but our process excuse me
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
our process in the law enforcement
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
division is that a member of our staff
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
identifies the person that's been
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
involved in this incident and they get
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
the best address for them they ask them
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
is this where you get your mail so on
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
and so forth a report is generated and
 
00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:48.590 align:start position:0%
and so forth a report is generated and
then

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
then
um

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
a bill his a bill is sent after it's
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
been determined that such bill is
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
necessary a bill is sent phone calls are
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
made there's there's follow-up with
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
multiple ways of sending it in the mail
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
and on the phone and after exhausting
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
all of the options to collect the funds
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
that is when we would ask that
 
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
somebody's license be suspended after
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
exhausting multiple phone calls offering
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
payment plans providing a hearing
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
even even
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of the bill that's
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
when we would ask that someone's driving
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
privileges would be suspended so we're
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
not we're not trying to make this run
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
rampant and we're not trying to
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
put anybody in a deficit for their life
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to travel to work but there
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
is a real cost associated with every one
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
of these missions
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of things that are
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
unforeseen in the future you know a
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
recent helicopter rescue alone exceeded
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand dollars
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
the National Guard
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
submits a billing waiver to the National
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
Guard Bureau so the fish and game
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have to incur that
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
cost if that ever changes that was one
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
Mission eighty two thousand dollars so
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
if we don't have some some teeth in this
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
this bill that originated in 2015 you
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
know 206 26 BB was in 2015 and and the
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority and the intent of
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
that was to do what we're asking to do
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
today was that after multiple attempts
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
to try to get somebody to to pay the DMV
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
would suspend their driving privileges
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
that happened back in 2015 it just
 
00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:38.899 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
most recently director of Motor Vehicle
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
bolecki who who had
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
she's not there now it's marasco but she
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
requested to us to try to firm this up
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
and Colonel Jordan over the past year
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
and a half worked with the Attorney
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
General's office to firm up this bill
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
which is what you have in front of you
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 13 FN
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
so I hope I've offered just a little bit
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
more clarity on all of this and I'm
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
happy to try to take any questions that
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.189 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
committee

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Fox
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I may have missed you
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
may have said this and I may have missed
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
it but what is the average bill that was
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'll run through the the cost of each
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill for the eight that happened in
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
2022. there was one bill for 752 dollars
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
there was a bill for 206 dollars there
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
was a bill for 1216 another bill for
 
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.789 align:start position:0%
was a bill for 1216 another bill for
169.

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
169.
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
a bill for just over
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
2500 and then another bill for a
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
thousand so some of these are they're
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
they're not you know huge money could it
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
be again when you when you have a
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
multiple day search that involves a lot
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
of officers that have been on regular
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
time and overtime and Equipment have
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
been equipment's been used it it could
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
get expensive I'll try to go through
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
one that happened
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
the highest bill that I see sent out
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
in the past three years was for four
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm actually going to
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
follow up on her question could you
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
provide the committee wouldn't say those
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
last three years of these expenses
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the future not today and What's the
 
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
in the future not today and What's the
total

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
everything considered average
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
expense for the year for all the search
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
and rescues not just the ones that may
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
get a bill but but in general and the
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
reason I'm asking these questions is
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
because we currently have retained House
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 650 which is seeking to remove the
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
latest suspension of licenses for
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
everything that's not motor vehicle
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
related so the more importance we can
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
see with this it might help sure
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
I I can certainly provide the committee
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
with with the bills that were within the
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
last three years I have that that form
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
here I'd have to make copies
 
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.970 align:start position:0%
here I'd have to make copies
um

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
with regard to the total cost it has it
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
total cost for for dive search and
 
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.010 align:start position:0%
total cost for for dive search and
rescue

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.020 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
walkaways Alzheimer's missing children
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
has been anywhere between 180 and 240
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
missions per year over the last decade
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the average cost has been between
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know 350
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
000 coming upwards of four hundred
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and those costs have
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
been offset by the hike safe card which
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
again last year three hundred and eleven
 
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.220 align:start position:0%
thousand and then the search and rescue
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
fund which has the ohrv snow machine and
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
boat registration so thankfully that
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
hike safe was it has been working
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't force anybody to buy
 
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:23.660 align:start position:0%
a 25
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
individual card and we can't force
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
anybody to buy the 35 family card but
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
that funding mechanism has been working
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
but we have 1.4 million people in the
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it's a
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
beautiful state and the outdoor
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
recreation community it's only growing
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's not just Hunting Fishing trapping
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's lots of people that are
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
kayaking and boating
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and just out walking and enjoying
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
enjoying nature so
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
I think a bill like this is important
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
for the future because
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the event that you have less people
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
that actually want to contribute to the
 
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.470 align:start position:0%
that actually want to contribute to the
Department

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
and you have more people that are out
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
just for their own intrinsic benefit
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have a an overarching
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't necessarily care
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
department they want to come and
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
recreate they're from far away
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
this bill will give us a little bit of
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
leeway if you will to kind of collect
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the funds associated with the search and
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
rescue missions of our state it's not a
 
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
huge financial impact I can think of it
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
being much more important for not
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
reducing it for all the other stuff
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of people that
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't pay
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know a speeding ticket and we have a
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
lot of people that don't pay a snow
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
machine or a hunting or a fishing ticket
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the only reasons that they do
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
end up paying the court is because
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
their license privileges is going to get
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
suspended so I
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm scared about that one for sure
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
we needed your testimony on 650.
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative sakes I'm okay
 
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.049 align:start position:0%
representative sakes I'm okay
okay representative

00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you lieutenant for
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the process is you
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
find someone negligent and then you know
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
you send the letter out and then there's
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
multiple calls and all that can you give
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
us an idea of from the time that it's
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
determined that it's negligent
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
what's the time period that all these
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
calls are done
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
over is a couple months is it you know
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
half a year what is it
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
it it depends um I know you probably
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
hate hearing that but some people are
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
very um very compliant and are
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
accountable so you send them a bill and
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
they call you and say I want to take
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
care of this right away in that regard
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
the mission happened in February the
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
report was completed by the end of
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
February March the billing memo went out
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
by the end of March it's resolved so I
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
would say six to eight weeks it could be
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
resolved if somebody takes that
 
00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.630 align:start position:0%
resolved if somebody takes that
accountability

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we wouldn't be as Hasty if
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't answer the written
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
record so now we're calling now we're
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
trying to do additional research
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
reaching out to a state do you have an
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
updated address for this person even
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
though they supplied us with an address
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
we're looking at motor vehicle records
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a different address
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere and we're sending it certified
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
mail to multiple residences sometimes
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
and trying to do follow-up calls and
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
calling a person that was associated
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
with that rescue do you have updated
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
contact information so that that all of
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
that could be six months or more
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
by the time you're doing some follow-up
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
because these people are from out of
 
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.450 align:start position:0%
because these people are from out of
state

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I had one where a gentleman was from
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
Texas and he was out on the trail he was
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
a through hiker and he said he never got
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff and so
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
it took months to track him down and
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately he did comply and he and he
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
paid some of it but
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
I would say a minimum of six to eight
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
weeks and a maximum it could be upwards
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
of a year and if they want to push the
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.810 align:start position:0%
process and
um

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
they they want to have a hearing and
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
then they want to challenge it all the
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
way up to the superior and Supreme Court
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
it could be years I've seen that in my
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned out of Staters what
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
happens without a Staters do can we
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
revoke like you mentioned the person
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
from Texas
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
um if they didn't pay do we have the
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
ability would this bill have the ability
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
to revoke licenses in Texas there's
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
reciprocity there is reciprocity amongst
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
driving privileges in the United States
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't I couldn't speak to every state
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's reciprocal with the state of New
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I can
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
generally there is reciprocity and
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
especially in the New England states
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
where those are the folks that are going
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
to be more likely recreating in our in
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
yes for the questions
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative good
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
see thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I was
 
00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I was
wondering

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
um about how many search and rescue
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
events you have in a year uh and break
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
that down with how many have had the
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
hikes safe cards or and some other
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
provision and you know down to how many
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
you're having to chase after you know is
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
that separate the 18 that you mentioned
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
is that separate from ones who paid
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
right away when you send them a bill
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
so breaking down the number of people
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
that have a hike safe card I I don't
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
have that compared to the 180
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that sometimes the
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
people that we rescue do have a hike
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
Safeguard and they're like I have a hike
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
safe card I don't have it with me but I
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
I have one can you look it up so they're
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're all excited and then people are
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
also that have hunting fishing
 
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.130 align:start position:0%
also that have hunting fishing
um

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
ohrv snow machine they'll they'll also
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
let you know but
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't we have not historically
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
billed anybody that has any of those
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
things if they have a hike safe card if
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
they have a family hike safe if they
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
have a snow machine registration ohrv
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
registration boating registration height
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hunting Fishing we we hit we have just
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
not build them
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%

00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
this is this is for the people that that

this is this is for the people that that
are

are
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
have been negligent and haven't done
 
00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:51.950 align:start position:0%
have been negligent and haven't done
anything

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
from a cost perspective to help bolster
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:56.990 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Fish and Game
department

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
the consumptive users the people that
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
are that are paying the salaries and and
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
we we have not build them and I'm sorry
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
if I didn't answer your question
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative all right thank you
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
I guess deal representative sellers yeah
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I might have missed part of this at
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
the hike safe car could you explain that
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
again from one and I just wanted to find
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
out have you thought about
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
and and this is you could probably
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
explain it as you along but is there a
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
like an insurance card if that is you
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
know so purchase it and do you give them
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
maybe a tracking device that's good for
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
the year or something
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
so with with regard to the hike safe
 
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.380 align:start position:0%
card uh in the past in 2022 there was 12
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
191 hike safe cards that were purchased
 
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.140 align:start position:0%
of that 7 321 were individuals
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
4870 were families of that six thousand
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
one hundred and sixty were residents of
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
the state and six thousand Thirty One
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
were non-residents that that number may
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
surprise you but those that's the
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
breakdown and and they totaled three
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand and ele you know
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
three hundred eleven thousand dollars
 
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.370 align:start position:0%
three hundred eleven thousand dollars
so

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
it is it is definitely helping as far as
 
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.450 align:start position:0%
it is it is definitely helping as far as
tracking

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
um or having a tracking device we don't
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
we don't have that the hike safe Card is
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
only good for the calendar year so it's
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
purchased between January 1st and it
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
expires on December 31st and this the
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
hike safe card right now is for
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um if if for me as a family it would be
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
it would cover me my wife my four and a
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
half year old son and my three-year-old
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
daughter that's who would be covered if
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
I had stepchildren they would also be
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
covered and if I was deemed to be a
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
guardian of the state for another minor
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
they would be covered but that's who
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
would be covered under a family plan the
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
individual plan is self-explanatory
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
boat ohrv snow machine hunting fishing
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
license all provide you with the same
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
the same guarantees if you will and it's
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
not an insurance card
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
um there there are
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
there are agencies not not so much State
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
agencies but actual insurance companies
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
that will sell you
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
a rescue insurance
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
and I had one last one and I'll let you
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
off the hook we're going to get into our
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
next Hearing in a minute anyway my
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
question is because it always I always
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm always uneasy when I hear that one
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
individual can determine negligence it's
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
not a judge by the way
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um can you just give me quickly an
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
example of what would-be negligence on
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
as it's looked at right now and when
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's not sure sure
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
ah so this one this one might blow your
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
mind but I you asked for an example so
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll give you one uh very very
 
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.649 align:start position:0%
I'll give you one uh very very
um

00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
wet forecasted
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
um cold precipitation was going to be
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
high winds were going to be extremely
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
high a person that just went out
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
um that just had a double hip
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
replacement thought it would be a good
 
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:30.980 align:start position:0%
idea to take a 60 pound pack
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
up onto the Franconia Ridge Trail in
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
treacherous conditions and ultimately
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
required a rescue
 
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.289 align:start position:0%
required a rescue
so

00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
that would be one that is a
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's extreme but I was on it I
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
I you know I watched officers that I was
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
hiking with
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
come real close to being hypothermic and
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
being you know a casualty themselves so
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
we we try to educate folks we have a
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
hike safe program we're in schools we
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to the public we have you know
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
we just had discover wild New Hampshire
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
day where 8 000 people come and we're
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to connect people to
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
life Outdoors that through education so
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
thankfully that doesn't happen all the
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
time the the vast majority of them that
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be negligent is that you know a
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
family went out and they read the map
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
wrong they got spun around and they took
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
a drainage as opposed to coming down a
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
trail this little drainage meandered off
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
and they thought it was a trail and they
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
went down and ended up in a brook
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
drainage and followed that and they were
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
they were never on the trail and they
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
called and panicked and we try to get
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
them back onto the trail but they say
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's dark and we don't have lights
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
um and that in that case you know we try
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
to work with them and most of the time
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
those people will they'll actually send
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
a donation they'll they want to take
 
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
a donation they'll they want to take
responsibility

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
so again I want to want to point out in
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
circle back that eight eight bills in
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
2022 7 and 20 17 in 2021 and 15 in 2020.
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
this is a small number
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
based on the the 180 average that we
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
have and really it's two or three people
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
are pushing this process to where it
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
would be the suspension per year it's a
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
very small number most of our people are
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
good the people that are recreating here
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
I have nobody else signed up to speak on
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 13 so I'm going to close the
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes to reset and we'll
 
00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
all right being 1002 we'll open up the
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 118
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
requiring children under the age of two
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
years to be restrained in a motor
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh chair recognizes the prime
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor welcome back Senator Fenton
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so much it is it's good to be
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
home as they say
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and Ladies and
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen of the committee for the
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
record I am Senator Donovan Fenton I
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
represent uh Senate District 10. I'm
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
here today to talk to you about Senate
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 118 which would require children
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
under the age of two to be restrained in
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
a rear-facing car seat
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics has
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
expanded their car seat recommendations
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
to keep children rear-facing for as long
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
they did this because it will help save
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
lives every month at a child rides we
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
were facing gives them more time for the
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
head and neck to fully develop
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
a rear-facing car seat cradles the
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
child's entire body it only takes 1 4
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
inch of a stretch for a child's spinal
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
cord to rupture using the correct
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
currency can decrease death or Serious
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
injury by 70 percent and you'll see an
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
example later on this bill fills a much
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
needed Gap in child safety laws here in
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats are no more
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
expensive than front-facing there's no
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
ABS there's absolutely no reason or
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
extra costs to why you should not have
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
your child rear-facing for as long as
 
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.930 align:start position:0%
your child rear-facing for as long as
possible

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does not overlap any existing
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
laws and helps protect our most
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population it also follows
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer laws so that if your
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
child is larger than average it does not
 
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
child is larger than average it does not
apply

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
we had a commissioned to study this and
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
collect data and what we found was that
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats unequivocally are
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
the better choice not a single group or
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
individual who testified told us
 
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
individual who testified told us
otherwise

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
currently there is no language to
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
protect this group and this bill will do
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
just that we have some experts speaking
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions I urge you
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
to ask them but I'm always open for
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you guys so much
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
just one for me yes sir no you said
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
there was a choice it's a logical choice
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
to buy rear facing so that means that
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
you're currently front-facing child
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
seats they would still accommodate the
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
younger and smaller there are there are
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
so we have someone from Chad who deals
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
with car seat safety so we could
 
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
probably answer that but there are
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
convertible car seats that can be
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
forward-facing or rear-facing yep
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
I would know the questions thank you
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
very much guys let me off easy thank you
 
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay next up she recognizes I think it's
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
James edston uh representing Dartmouth
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
Health in support of the bill seeking
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.410 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jim Heston I
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
work for Dartmouth Health children's I'm
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
also the chair for the New Hampshire
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
Safe Kids Coalition we are in support of
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and the reason is children
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
as you all know have very weak neck
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
strength the issue becomes that in the
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
event of a crash their heads are going
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
to go forward there can be spinal
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
injuries neck injuries all along the way
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is allow
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
children to ride rear-facing longer
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
giving that neck strength a chance to
 
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:46.700 align:start position:0%
grow it to build
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
and in the event of a crash we know that
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
the majority of crashes are from the
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
front being in that car seat is going to
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
allow them to write out the initial
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
major crash forces that are happening
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
and then um there'll be the the
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
reciprocal forces applied to them when
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
they go forward back after that so
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons that we're
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
very much in support of this the
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics and
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
um the CDC both recommend that children
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
write rear facing as long as their seat
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
will allow them the nice thing about
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is that with the two-year
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
limit in there what we're doing is in
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
the past they used to say one year with
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
this what it's allowing is the children
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
to um write that again be be rear-facing
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
but we all know that there are two types
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
of child safety seats one is the
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
rear-facing only which is one you're
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with it has the
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
carrier it goes into a base in the car
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
those have a limit of depending on the
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
type of seat anywhere from 22 to 30
 
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.730 align:start position:0%
type of seat anywhere from 22 to 30
pounds

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:57.740 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
the type of seat that we're talking
 
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
about that would accommodate the
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
children is a convertible seat so it's
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
structured in such a way that the
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
children can ride rear-facing and max
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
out the seat's weight which in a lot of
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
cases is 40 pounds to 45 pounds and then
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
it allows the the seat to go forward
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
facing so when they do Max that out they
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
can go and um
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh ride forward-facing
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
um again so the issue becomes with a lot
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
of parents they want to see their
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
children and it's a lot easier to see
 
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:34.220 align:start position:0%
them when they're writing and that that
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
forward-facing position but again from a
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
standpoint of data and everything else
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we have we know that writing the
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
rear facing is going to be the better
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
one for them
 
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.650 align:start position:0%
one for them
so

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
any questions I can answer for you thank
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
you certain questions from the committee
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Jones
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming sir um
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to add the American Academy
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics that's that's a
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's Physicians who are concerned
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
about their wealth and well-being of
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
they're not a third party certification
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
is there like a manufacturer's
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
third-party certification that tells you
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
which equipment is safe and which isn't
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
so the national highway traffic safety
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
administration does a lot of work with
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
car seat testing um there are there's
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
also the Insurance Institute that tests
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
these car seats out so that they know
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
what um what kind of Crash forces that
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
will happen and they they do crash test
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
and that that is available
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
that data's available I don't have it
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
but I could certainly no I'm not asking
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
for it no I the public can find it
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you you're welcome any
 
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:41.900 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
the question thank you the
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
um do you know the number of zero to
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
two-year-olds that are in crashes and
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
haven't survived or have been a problem
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have that number available to me
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but we can certainly get that for you
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions did you want
 
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
to follow up yep follow up thank you
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other question I had was uh the cost
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
of these car seats I mean we know the
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
the families have to buy a car seat
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
anyway but you're talking about a
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
special car seat a convertible one
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
um what about the families that really
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
have uh maybe a very low income you know
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
how how are they are these car seats
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
being provided or how do they purchasing
 
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.370 align:start position:0%
being provided or how do they purchasing
these

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
okay so the first part of that question
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
um we can help provide those car seats
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
for them through grants we have fitting
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
stations around the state of New
 
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.290 align:start position:0%
stations around the state of New
Hampshire

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
um in in at least um 50 or 60 of those
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
that can help out parents that need
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
those the rear-facing seats um the
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
rear-facing only seat with the with the
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
carry handle and in the basket
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
um we don't provide those we do provide
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
the convertible car seats so that they
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
can use those much longer and that's the
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of the convertible again
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
you're using it rear facing and
 
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.150 align:start position:0%
you're using it rear facing and
forward-facing

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.910 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative Leon opposed to the bill
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee last year I
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
participated on the committee to
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate basically to evaluate the data
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
on rear-facing child seats and to figure
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
out what data we had where the benefits
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
were and we spoke to a lot of different
 
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:45.740 align:start position:0%
experts we actually found that
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
fortunately this is not much of a
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire because the
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
number of crashes with injuries to young
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
children is very very very very small we
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually don't have any good data on how
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
many children under two years old are
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
involved in these crashes and we don't
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
have any good data on what seats they
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
are in they are generally broken down in
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
the zero to four year age range and
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
several of these children were listed as
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
being one years old in one of the
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
reports being in a booster seat which I
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
don't think is actually even really
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
physically possible to have a child
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
under four years under one year old in a
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
booster seat so there are serious
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
problems with our data here in New
 
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.010 align:start position:0%
problems with our data here in New
Hampshire

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
um beyond that though we had some other
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
fantastic data we had a gentleman come
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
in and on zoom and speak to us and
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
actually we'd all be safer in
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats because the human
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
body is designed to take impact on the
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
back as you're laying down as opposed to
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
on the front but there are a lot of
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
other factors that also come into play
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
when you have these car seats they do
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
take a lot of space up in the car I'm a
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
mom to three boys and
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
let me tell you it was really hard
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
trying to fit a rear-facing car seat
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
into a sedan with a family of five we
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
were able to do that with one of those
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
bucket carriers the ones that now go up
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
to some of them actually go up to 35
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
pounds but you also have height limits
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
in those seats when it came time to put
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
my youngest son in a rear-facing seat
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
one of the convertibles it was
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
physically impossible to get that into
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
my husband's car without displacing the
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
front passenger so ins you'd either have
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
to have that with their knees in the
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
dashboard which also isn't safe and
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to disable the airbag or
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
possibly not fit anybody so then when
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
you have a family that doesn't have a
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
giant sequoia like I do you end up
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
making low-income families buy a
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
different car to fit their family
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the price of a
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
car scene we're talking about having
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
extra seating capacity to accommodate a
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
car seat for a certain amount of time
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know we also might be talking about
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
a family that is reducing the amount of
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
food that's going to their kids for an
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
event that has happened an event that is
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
very very rare
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
we I believe I can get the numbers for
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
you but I believe that there were six
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
children under four who had a
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
significant injury enough to go to the
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
hospital not necessarily
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
life-threatening but a serious injury
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
obviously in recent events we had a
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
tragedy with some young children in a
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
car so we do know that those numbers
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
have gone up
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill there's another big
 
00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.450 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill there's another big
problem

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
when you look at states where they have
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
an age limit
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
everybody's really excited about when
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
their kid graduates and gets to sit
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
forward facing he's two years old in one
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
day let's set him forward facing but
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
extended rear facing is the safer choice
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
we should have been be encouraging
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
parents with data and facts to rear
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
faces as long as they can with their
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
kids up to three four even five years
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
old If the child will tolerate it
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
because it is safer but when we set set
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
the limit of two years then we introduce
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
this idea of well he's reached the
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
second birthday so we're going to turn
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
him around and you actually end up
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
reducing that safety
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
basically it's an education issue this
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't not all education issues not all
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations need to be law and this
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
law would end up hurting some of our
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
lower income families and this law
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
really is is not necessary here in New
 
00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:18.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a vet we have a safe
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
culture of safety we have a higher we
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
have very high seat belt usage despite
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
not having a law for adults and we have
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of families that know that rear
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
facing is the way to go we just don't
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
need to criminalize the behavior of
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
turning them around sooner if that's
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
what the family needs in order to fit
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
all their family in the car or because
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
they needed to be because they had some
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
other necessary need
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll take any questions and
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
I can provide the car seat committee
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
report to you an email format later
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
that would be great and I do have one
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
question you touched on in terms of
 
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.589 align:start position:0%
question you touched on in terms of
Education

00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
how much of that if any of that is
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
provided now
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of the benefits of a particular
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
type of seat
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of information out there
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of parents seek out people like
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
the car seat lady and find that
 
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.609 align:start position:0%
the car seat lady and find that
information

00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:09.619 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
the the pediatricians have that
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
information when you're going to
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
parenting classes they have that
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
information they discuss it with you in
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
your prenatal visits to make sure that
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
you have a car seat that is appropriate
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of Education that does
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
happen already and there's also Flyers
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
about the car seat installation events
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
committee representative Jones
 
00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:35.099 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
more comment than a question we'd only
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
take questions here representative it's
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's a question okay okay
 
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.030 align:start position:0%
it's a question okay okay
uh

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
I is it true so now it's a question
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that you shouldn't be using car seats
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
that that you've bought used or bought
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
from a consignment store because they
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
may have been an accident and they may
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
have meet their stress limit already is
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
um yes you should never use a car seat
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
whose history you don't know and if
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're involved in an accident at any
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
speed you are supposed to replace that
 
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
car seat car insurance will replace a
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
car seat for any vehicle that's in an
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
accident if it's been installed at the
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
time of the accident
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
see you then thank you very much I do
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
have one on the certification by the
 
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:26.540 align:start position:0%
ntsa about the car seats and the safety
 
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:29.099 align:start position:0%
as far as that safety all any car seat
 
00:48:30.609 --> 00:48:30.619 align:start position:0%
that's on the market and is available
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
meets minimum safety standards and when
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
you end up looking at the data ratings
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
they're all very very close together so
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
most of them hold within a very solid
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
safety standard
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and you did say you can you
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
can provide us with the report yes I
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
will forward that I had that from Brad
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
Greenland one of the assistants so I'll
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
forward that now
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
okay next up share recognizes Dan
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
Goodman representing the AAA in support
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill looking for three minutes
 
00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:08.390 align:start position:0%
of the bill looking for three minutes
welcome

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that uh for the record
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Goodman and I represent
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
AAA of Northern New England
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to clarify a point
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier this bill would not
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
require any parent to purchase a new car
 
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.690 align:start position:0%
require any parent to purchase a new car
seat

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
um when you when you have a when let's
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
say you have a newborn
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the nurse at the hospital or someone
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
at the hospital looks at that car seat
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
before you leave with your newborn they
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
would not let you leave in a
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
forward-facing car seat so what this
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
bill would just have you keep your child
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
in that existing car seat that you
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
already own
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
up until two years older or until you
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
reach the higher weight limits of the
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
car seat
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
just a quick clarification that's the
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
way at least I I see it and
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
I just want to quickly go over a couple
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
of the studies that
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned there was a
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
study report completed in 2022 and a
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
couple of studies that uh that they they
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
looked at that really show that
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
staying in a rear-facing car seat is the
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
best thing to do for our children in
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
2007 the University of Virginia study
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
found that children were 75 percent
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer severe or fatal
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
injuries in a crash if they are facing
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the rear
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
in 2017 restraint use saved the lives of
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
325 children each four years and younger
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
a 2013 Nitza analysis found that correct
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
child seat safety usage was linked with
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
a fatality reduction of 57 percent among
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
children one to three years old there's
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
also a belief that
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
parents are properly restraining their
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
children in AAA study in 2021 found that
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
52 to 84 percent of car seats that was
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
inspected by child passenger safety
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
technicians around the country were
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
improv or installed incorrectly with the
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
number one reason for the installation
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
incorrect was the wrong car seat for
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
instance putting a forward-facing
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
putting a child in the forward-facing
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
car seat too early
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
a 2018 Ohio State University Medical
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
Center study looked at rear-facing car
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
seats and rear impact crashes rear
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
impact crashes they found that
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
rear-facing seats are able to support
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
the child's head neck and Spine and keep
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
those vulnerable body regions well
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
protected these reasons are especially
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in newborns younger children
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
whose spine and vertebrae haven't fused
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
and fully developed
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I think uh yeah you know with our
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
existing law seven to fifty seven years
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
old or 57 pounds this will provide this
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill would provide the education that
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
parents I think really need as has been
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned in many of the bills here
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
Traffic Safety bills it's a three-legged
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
stool education enforcement engineering
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
they have designed the car seats designs
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
have improved over the years so we've
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
engineering there's CPS technicians and
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety Office of
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety providing a lot of
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
Education throughout the state but it's
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
lacking is that enforcement piece and
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
this bill will close that Loop and with
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have one question to
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
clarify something I thought I heard you
 
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.010 align:start position:0%
clarify something I thought I heard you
say

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
did you say hospitals would hold
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
children hostage until they have a
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
rear-facing child seat installed in the
 
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.170 align:start position:0%
rear-facing child seat installed in the
car

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question chairman
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
they they it it sometimes feels like
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
they heldu host they do not hold you
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
hostage but they would when when they I
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually don't know exactly what they
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
would do but I'm my understanding is
 
00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:43.099 align:start position:0%
they they would not
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
when when I first with my first child
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
who's four now they were installed
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and they they reinstalled it
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
um put them properly fast and and I was
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
told that if I had the wrong car seat
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
they would help me get a better car seat
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
if that helps answer your question
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
no but that's okay and further questions
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.329 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
chair

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm trying to figure out how many
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
parents this may affect that don't do
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
this now you know I I mean are we
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire I mean is it
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
one two fifty five hundred I mean it
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
just seems like the number is so tiny
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this is necessary do you
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
have any data or anything on that
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I don't
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
have any data I'm not sure if the CPS
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
technicians around the state compile
 
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
data on incorrect car seats what they
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
what they see it and and a lot of that
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
data that we're seeing from the CPS tax
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
which is when we see like I stated 52 to
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
84 percent of car seats are installed
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
incorrectly that's only really from a
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
small percentage of parents or
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
grandparents who are bringing their cars
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
into these check stations at fire
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
stations and police departments
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so so unfortunately I don't have that
 
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
um so so unfortunately I don't have that
data

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%

00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
um next one is scheduled for 10 30. so
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%

holders Prime sponsor is not available
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
so representative Sykes has been kind
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
enough to introduce the bill
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
of Daisy review for some of you on this
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
issue and this bill because um the
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee I thank them for their good
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
work uh last year on a version of this
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
we didn't quite get there but having
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
benefited from what this committee
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
suggested there were issues that need to
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
be addressed we worked over it on this
 
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:50.660 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm very grateful to director
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
rasho and Jeff oberdanka who have kind
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
of I think come up with some pretty good
 
01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
of I think come up with some pretty good
language

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:05:58.569 --> 01:05:58.579 align:start position:0%
um that protects New Hampshire's
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
interests and yet helps our Farmers out
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
with this issue of the h2a Visa Visa so
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
um let me just describe a little bit why
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
um this is helpful uh for us and can
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
solve some problems for the state
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
um there's h2a workers are agricultural
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
workers who come under a special Visa to
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
work on our our Farms you know about
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've got about 240 to 250 Farms not all
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
of them need this labor but several of
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
the larger operations do as we will as
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
we will hear and um these folks have
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
been coming for decades and decades and
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of times a particular Farm there's
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
a relationship with a group of workers
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
they come up these visas are good for a
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
10-month stay which is you know harvest
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
season planning and harvest season plus
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
and they're going to need to be able to
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
be on on the roads now
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um it has been in others in others the
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
states around us that there's a
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
recognition of certain kinds of uh
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
international driver's license or
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for other countries
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
and because we don't have that
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
explicitly in State Statute a couple of
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
things are are happening they're here
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
for the 60 days and it kicks in
 
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:18.020 align:start position:0%
um uh under
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
263.35 that they're supposed to get a
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
state license if they're here for more
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
than 60 days well they don't want that
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of because it'd be kind of
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for them they got their
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
license they're not they're not wanting
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
to be residents of New Hampshire
 
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
but since we don't recognize these other
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
forms of Licensing then they're kind of
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
stuck the second thing is that the feds
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
have been coming in in the Department of
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
Labor and they've been wanting to find
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
these Farms
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
because they the state doesn't have this
 
01:07:48.359 --> 01:07:49.609 align:start position:0%
because they the state doesn't have this
program

01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and this is a you know a problem for
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
our our farmers and again all the states
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
around us they do something like this
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
and there's no issues about the
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor coming in and trying
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
to I think harass our Farmers although I
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
know I shouldn't use that word but um
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's that that's is the way it seems
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom line here is how do we
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
enable these particular Visa holders to
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
come and do the agriculture work and be
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
able to operate their farm equipment or
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
to drive
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
um on a valid license from another
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction while they are are here
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
while we make sure that we protect our
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
roads and New Hampshire citizens by
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
knowing that these drivers have good
 
01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:37.219 align:start position:0%
safety records
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
and have a license that ensures that
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
they've had at least as rigorous a
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
training and requirements for getting
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
that license as we'd have for New
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
so that's the background
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
um to this and uh again thanks to
 
01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
um to this and uh again thanks to
um the

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
division on the language that we come up
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
here about reciprocity agreements for
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
h2a workers now we have existing
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
reciprocity Arrangements on licensings
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
with uh with some Nations we're working
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
on one with kind of we passed some
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
legislation did something like this for
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
Taiwan in terms of reciprocity
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
agreements so we do we do these kinds of
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
things and this is a a particular way to
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
address these kinds of of workers
 
01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.370 align:start position:0%
address these kinds of of workers
um

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.689 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot operate a motor vehicle in
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire unless starting lines five
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
and six
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
and here are the criteria that we came
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
up with he or she holds the valid
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
driver's license or permit to operate a
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle issued by another Juris
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
U.S jurisdiction so that could be
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
another state where they have been
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
working and we recognize licenses issued
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
by other other states
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
or starting on line nine he or she holds
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
a valid driver's license or permit
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
to operate a motor vehicle from a
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction outside the United States
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
18 lawfully present in the country under
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
this Visa program
 
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
is present for less than a year well
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's the 10 months of the program I
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean you can get an h2a visa for up to
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
three years but it's a 10 it's it
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
basically it's a 10 month Visa that
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're operating under
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so I've been here less than a year
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
he or she possesses an international
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
driver permit
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
if their home country license is not in
 
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.450 align:start position:0%
if their home country license is not in
English

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
English
 
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.649 align:start position:0%
English
so

01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's important if an officer pulls
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
someone over
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
and wants to determine if it's a valid
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
license they need to be able to have
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
some days in English and if their home
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
country license is not then the
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
international driver's permit which is
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
what something they can get will be
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
um now let me just mention a little more
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the background on this and the work
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that was uh done with these foreign
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions a lot of these workers are
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
from Jamaica they have long provided
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
agricultural workers to the Northeast
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
and as I said there are some Decades of
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
relationships with these workers who
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
come up to the same farms and we had a
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
consular official from Jamaica come up
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
to the Senate hearing who very
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
thoroughly described to us the licensing
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
requirements which are actually stricter
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire ones and also the
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
assurance that we have that if someone
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
has committed a violation down there
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
then we're going to know about it
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
and if somebody commits a violation up
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
up here that then they're going to be
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
subject to Driver's loss in their home
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
Home Country so that was very helpful to
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
hear but it's not just Jamaica we've had
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
some from South Africa we've had some
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
from Mexico uh sprinkling from other
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
countries countries potentially
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's the kind of Workforce that
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
we're we're dealing with
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
um this is something the Farm Bureau
 
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:54.910 align:start position:0%
um this is something the Farm Bureau
um

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
supports uh we've had a lot you know the
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
farmers come down to support and um I
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
hope Mr chairman members of the
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
committee that you see how we benefited
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
from your deliberations last time and
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
came up with a bill that addresses the
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you raise so uh thank you
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
and I I know um I'm really grateful that
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
director Racha is here

um who can you know talk a lot of the
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
ins and outs about how we do reciprocity
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and how this will work for
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
for for the division so thank you
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that Senator I was
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to mention to the committee we do
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
have uh director marasco signed up to
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
speak so in terms of how the law
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually functions right now questions
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh about those would be best served by
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
him that being said any questions for
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters

good morning
um

um
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
you you are anticipating with this
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that there would be a formal
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
agreement between New Hampshire and
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
their home state so Jamaica and Mexico
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the other countries that you
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned yeah is that I don't see that
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the legislation so that's
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
what I was thanks for that question
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
there is an option there
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
I mean this what's nice about this bill
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
is that it takes care of a variety of
 
01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.570 align:start position:0%
is that it takes care of a variety of
jurisdictions

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to leave our Farmers
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
hanging if it just happens that we have
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
a that there's a jurisdiction with which
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have not gone through the you know
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
kind of lengthy process of working
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
through reciprocity but as we're doing
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
with Taiwan right now we can do that
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
um we you know we can do that process
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
process of one one country
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I think though for the particular
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
purpose of h2a visas which are this
 
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.669 align:start position:0%
purpose of h2a visas which are this
particular

01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
form a Visa for agricultural workers
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
that this approach is probably much more
 
01:13:56.159 --> 01:13:57.169 align:start position:0%
that this approach is probably much more
efficient

01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
and a little more comprehensive than the
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
process of doing a reciprocity agreement
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
with every single country from which
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone might arrive and the reciprocity
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
agreement is going to probably cover a
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot more than just these these Visas so
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good way to go but
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
that your your question you know you can
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
I think ask director Morocco because
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
we've had some conversation about that
 
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.770 align:start position:0%
we've had some conversation about that
too

01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.270 align:start position:0%
too
mm-hmm

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
we have one last one yeah line seven it
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
brings up a question
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh he or she all developed license to
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
permit operated motor vehicle issued by
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
another U.S jurisdiction so question is
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire the only state that
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
does not have jurisdiction or recognize
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
Jamaican licenses or are there others
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
um my understanding from working over
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
this last couple years is that
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
we are doing one of our surrounding
 
01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:50.930 align:start position:0%
we are doing one of our surrounding
states

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
that doesn't take care of this
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
so you know a worker who's picking
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
apples or other something up in Maine
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
and may have a you know under main has
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
gotten a recognition
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
um might come over to work in New
 
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.149 align:start position:0%
um might come over to work in New
Hampshire

01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
so but but we're the only state that
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know take care of this
 
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
because it's not just the workers right
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
it's the farmers who are getting the
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor coming in and
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
finding them some substantial amounts
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
because we don't have this in statute
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
so that's the other part of this that
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
this will take care of yeah
 
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.470 align:start position:0%
this will take care of yeah
um

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that one a little because it
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
looks like a U.S jurisdiction would be a
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
did you and your research on this this
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
is something I did not look into really
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds where the Department
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
of Labor is even going into this mode
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
you mentioned harassment but is there
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
more to it than that I think we'll hear
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
from the farmer who's been affected okay
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ming representing Hollis
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 35 in support of the bill
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and transportation
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Ben Bing
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
I'm a state representative for the town
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
of Hollis I'm speaking today in support
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
of SB 187
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm here both at the request of Trevor
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hardy of the Brookdale Fruit Farm who is
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents and as a resident
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the farming community that is Hollis
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
many of our Farms have employed
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
temporary agricultural workers from
 
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.010 align:start position:0%
temporary agricultural workers from
Jamaica

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
Jamaica
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
with Brookdale itself employing dozens
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
under the federal h2a program
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
they've done so for nearly four decades
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
and over that period of time complaints
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
are violations involving h2a workers
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
driving work vehicles and Hollis have
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
been minimal if not completely
 
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.689 align:start position:0%
been minimal if not completely
non-existent

01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
non-existent
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
farming is important to Hollis because
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture has an outsized impact on
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
the way it feels to live there
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
as a member of my Town's planning board
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
I get to hear what people care about the
 
01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.729 align:start position:0%
I get to hear what people care about the
most

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
as it relates to how land is used
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
and it's usually one of two things the
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
impact on schools or the effect on Rural
 
01:17:20.699 --> 01:17:21.950 align:start position:0%
impact on schools or the effect on Rural
character

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
character
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
although rural character has a very
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
specific definition in our zoning code
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
most people use it to express that they
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
like living in a small tight-knit
 
01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.850 align:start position:0%
like living in a small tight-knit
community

01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
connected to Agriculture and nature
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
multi-generational families like the
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hardys could tell you that much has
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
changed in Hollis since they first set
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
down their Roots but we still have easy
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
access to Fresh Foods and veg and
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
vegetables and they're still Scenic Wide
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
Open Fields all thanks to our local

farms
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
the success of our Farms drives what it
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
means for many of our residents to enjoy
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
living in our community
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
our Farms are that important therefore
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
our Farms seasonal workers are that
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
important they're a part of our

for my sins we've been employing
 
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
Jamaican uh folks through the h2a

2021 unaware of the existence of the law
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
that this this bill addresses
 
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.930 align:start position:0%
that this this bill addresses

would the need for which would be
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
obviated by this by this bill
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but then a couple of others who just
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
have Jamaican licenses they've never
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
been stopped by the police their
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
driver's record in that entire time is a
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
hundred percent clean the only thing I
 
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.090 align:start position:0%
hundred percent clean the only thing I
ever

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
heard from the police was that the chief
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
of the Plainfield Police called when uh
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
one of my gentlemen ran the crew fan
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
into a deer and he called to say please
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
do not blame this person for this
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
accident he did a brilliant job trying
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
to avoid it the police waved to our guys
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
fortunately I don't think the police
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
were aware of this law either I became
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
aware of it uh kind of grimly in 2021
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
when we got a U.S Department of Labor uh
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
audit which are irregular and they're um
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
sort of like
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
um tidal waves with tidal waves with an
 
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.850 align:start position:0%
um tidal waves with tidal waves with an
attitude

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
um but uh we and for failure to comply
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
fully with state law we were filed find
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
1250 because our Jamaican gentleman only
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
had Jamaican licenses and or
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
International permits that's what I
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
learned that there was even a law on the
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
books the one that this
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
this law thank goodness addresses
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
um our Farms are spread around
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get workers from
 
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
one place to another
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
not all of the Jamaican gentlemen who
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
work for us drive the ones with licenses
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
and some of them don't really want to
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
drive anywhere you know I mean even if
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
they have licenses but we need them to
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
be able to drive we've got we've got
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
Farm farms in Lebanon and farm in
 
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.090 align:start position:0%
Farm farms in Lebanon and farm in
Plainfield

01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
Plainfield
 
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
Plainfield
um

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
last year we tried very hard to get
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
to get one of them a New Hampshire
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
license when this bill failed last year
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we were
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
let's see that we were required at the
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
last minute to come up with a driving
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
record for for the DMV and I was it it
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
took us six weeks to get the driving
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
record from Jamaica so I guess we were
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
civil disobedience last year but but
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill and IT
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
addresses what I hope is just something
 
01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
my record uh the record of our farm
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
Jamaican drivers Is Not Unusual
 
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
um that is to say I'm not aware of any
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
moving violations at any of my
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
colleagues forums ever with Jamaican
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
licensed drivers meanwhile New Hampshire
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
is unusual in the surrounding states we
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
are the only one that has this
 
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.169 align:start position:0%
are the only one that has this
requirement

01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
so this bill which I hope you will
 
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.790 align:start position:0%
so this bill which I hope you will
support

01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
um will bring us into consistency with
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
our colleagues elsewhere around around
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
here and uh if we need to I guess we'll
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
get our gentleman New Hampshire driver's
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
licenses but I for the life of me can't
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
understand why that should be necessary
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
my New Hampshire license has never been
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
challenged in any country I've ever been
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
to in the world including a lot of them
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
that don't speak English
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
rented cars driven gotten pulled over
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
for moving violations and not allowed to
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
continue on my way so I think we should
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
be show Jamaica the same courtesy that
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
we are ourselves shunned by other
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
countries thank you thank you sir
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
Mr wood how are you fine thank you sir
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
how are you I'm well
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
um one piece that I was wanted a little
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
Clarity on you made a big effort to get
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
a driver's record for your employee from
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
Jamaica and you pointed out that it took
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
you pointed out the time that it took
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
but I didn't hear you mention the cost
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
for you as a phone well thank you thank
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
you generous question
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
um you cost a few hundred dollars in the
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
end because we we were required to send
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
the all the paperwork over land not by
 
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.550 align:start position:0%
the all the paperwork over land not by
email

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
to the Jamaican private agency which
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
itself charged they charged a couple
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
hundred bucks
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
they wanted to set express mail and it
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
got it got to Miami the next day but it
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
took four weeks to get to the hands of
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
the people in Jamaica
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and then there were there were some
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
other costs associated but it was
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
several hundred dollars to to fail now
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
the thing is in truth that was we were
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
trying to do a last minute job so if I
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
knew this year what I did not know last
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
year which is that they had to have a
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
driver's license but also that they
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
needed to get their driving record then
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
I would get a hold of the gentleman
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
before they come here and say please
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
bring your driving record when it was
 
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
ironic because when the men's driving
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
record arrived it was that there was it
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
was spotless forever he'd never had a
 
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
moving violation in Jamaica either but
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it was just another little
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
another couple of bucks it's like a tip
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
on the on the dot I mean a DOL thing
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for the question any other
 
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for the question any other
questions

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
just one I want to confirm
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
um you said the the Department of Labor
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
charged you or fined you 1250 in 2021
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
2021 sir thank you we talked it down a
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
little bit I can't remember what we
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
wound up paying but the original fine
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
was it's the timing of everything that's
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
interesting too yeah so uh with no other
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative Rich oh just wondering
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
how expensive it is is it to get an
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
international driver driving permit
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
that is mentioned on here is that I
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't think it costs uh anything in
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
Jamaica I'm sure yeah I don't they they
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
this this guy just
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
has it he's always gotten it nobody's
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
ever required that he has it haven't he
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
just but I I don't think he'd be doing
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
it if it cost him a lot of money
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
he's never mentioned it right that could
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
be a question for the director and
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%

folks
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly take the measure of
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
the few farmers
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the room today as not an indication
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the importance of spill to all of us
 
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:54.649 align:start position:0%
the importance of spill to all of us
um

01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
we started out 50 years ago an ad in the
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
paper would get you high school kids
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
and we can get plenty of people in our
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
farm to do retail and work in the
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
greenhouses for small for you know 15 20
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
hours a week and
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
quite honestly our we have an aged
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce most these people are retired
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
but we can't get anybody
 
01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.090 align:start position:0%
but we can't get anybody
anybody

01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
to even interview for stoop labor
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
and that's what we do strawberries Apple
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
we don't do apples but strawberries
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
raspberries blueberries squash carrots
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
small hands and knees labor can't get
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
can't get College because you can't get
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
high school kids you need these guys
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
and so the bottom line is
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's quite a it's quite a you go through
 
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of Hoops to get them here from
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
Jamaica in the very first place it's not
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
a simple process I don't call up or I
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
don't call up Jasper and say Hey you
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
know call Roy and Garnet and why don't
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
you guys come up next week it's a
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
long-involved process with the
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor uh to get these guys
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
up at some expense they're not cheap
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
labor either as you may well know
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
this additional New Hampshire license is
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
another added burden it's hard
 
01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
these people come up they take one day
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
off in there we're all worth they're all
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
working on a farm
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
so if you can relieve this burden from
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
from us or prevent it from going out for
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
that it would really be a great help to
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the farming community and I thank you

Senator Waters initially filed

this legislation last session Senate
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 308 as many of you aware at the
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
reason we approached Senator watt is
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
that he served on the 2019 commission to
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
study the licensing of drivers from
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
foreign countries and we this was a
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
request made of him just at the filing
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
deadline representative Sykes chaired
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
and as you're aware Mr chair this
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
committee has recommended this Senate
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
the the h2a agricultural guesswork
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
program is a temporary Visa program
 
01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
enabling Farms to hire seasonal
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural workers for a period of up
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
to one year
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
before they must return home
 
01:31:39.649 --> 01:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
most of the workers are here four to
 
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
eight months sometimes up to 10.
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
in his was previously said it is an
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
expensive program
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the these farmers are required to pay by
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
federal law and adverse effect wage rate
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is set at 16.95 an
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
hour currently they pay to transport
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
them to New Hampshire and they pay to
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
house them
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason they do this as was
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
previously said these are professional
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
Farm Workers that they cannot get here
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
these these people are vetted by three
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
federal agencies in one form or another
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%

department
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
as far as numbers go in New Hampshire
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
upwards of 50 farms and now utilizing at
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
least one h2a worker
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
over 300 employees Statewide total
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
as was also said previously a majority
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
of these workers in New Hampshire are
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
Jamaican that's different from much of
 
01:32:39.169 --> 01:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country where of the
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
total h2a worker pool in this country is
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
is 97 98 Spanish or Mexican
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where three quarters
 
01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.450 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where three quarters
Jamaican

01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
Jamaican
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
we do have some as was also previously
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
said there are that are Spanish Mexican
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
with South Africa for example we have I
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
know in kowas county that some of the
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree Growers utilize South
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
African workers
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
and as again as in in a also want to
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
this isn't an issue for the Mexican
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
workers because of our free trade
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have with that country
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's why it's kind of this is kind of
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
a niche with the the Mexican with the
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
Jamaican South African and other
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
countries and again I want to stress
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
these are professional workers these
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
these gentlemen these Farmers have
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
long-term relationships with these these
 
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
folks and I can tell you what some of
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
them they go down to Jamaican vacation
 
01:33:33.169 --> 01:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
with them the many of these workers have
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
come up here for years the same workers
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
year after year and when they're done
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
they they have some their friends or
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
they have their children that are
 
01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bill removes an unnecessary burden
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire Farm businesses that
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
has only experienced here in New
 
01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.570 align:start position:0%
has only experienced here in New
Hampshire

01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
and our border states Maine
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont individuals
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
are permitted to drive on their foreign
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
issue license for up to one year so just
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
think about this now
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
issue workers are coming into Maine
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont in Massachusetts and they are
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
driving into New Hampshire and back
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
and they're fine
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
we have people here working on New
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms who cannot drive in the
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
state they're working in and where would
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
it be a benefit to our Growers is for
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
the most part is when these workers are
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
traveling from field to field these guys
 
01:34:24.649 --> 01:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
aren't going out and vacationing and
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the sites they're working as
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
16 hours a day so they can pay to send
 
01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
money back to their families
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know as I said in New Hampshire to
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
be clear criminal law requires anyone in
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
the state Beyond 60 days and wishing to
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
drive hold a valid New Hampshire's
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
license uh uh or license from another
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction jurisdiction recognized by
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is also not an issue for h2a
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Employers in the other New England
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
states it's not an issue in New York
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue in New Jersey it's not
 
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
an issue from Pennsylvania again it's
 
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
only here in New Hampshire
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
this this is a a
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
removing a burden on New Hampshire
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
businesses these happen to be Farm
 
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.669 align:start position:0%
businesses these happen to be Farm
businesses

01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
was alluded to early as a catalyst for
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill comes from an incident an
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
incident we've had on two New Hampshire
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
farms uh where again they will find by
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and it was again
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
it was a paper audit it was the final
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
was the the conducting an audit it
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't where these workers were driving
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
and then and then nabbed by police it
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
was just a paper audit with the truth of
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is the Auditors said to the workers
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
will you have you been driving those
 
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
vehicles and they said yes because these
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
guys told them to be honest
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
and they and they were which is what the
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
again and in the interest of time I we
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
we urge you to we we've been at this for
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
four years now uh to uh uh recommend
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation is ought to pass and
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
any questions other than I will try to
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer the question that was asked
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
earlier regarding the cost of an
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
international driving permit it's issued
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
by the the sending Nation so if it's a
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
Jamaican workby Jamaica and if I
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
remember it was it was either 25 or 40
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
dollars not
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers thank
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
so you just stated that it's taken up to
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
fully years for this legislation to
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully at one day ought to pass is
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying we have been
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
working at on it for four years
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
is what I'm saying it was introduced
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
initially at Senate Bill 308
 
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
and then now
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's but we're on our side of it it's
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
been four years we have met numerous
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
times with the with motor vehicle we
 
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
attempted to try to solve it with uh as
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
Mr wood explained earlier and it was
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
costly in a time he didn't talk about
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
that time it cost him
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
to do all this or the day that he had to
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
pay his worker to try to he would have
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
to try his work and to go get his
 
01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
to try his work and to go get his
license

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Hill maybe Mr chair I do
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%

consulate that answered some questions
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
that this committee had previously and
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%

01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
um did I understand you correctly in
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
saying that in New Hampshire we're
 
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
currently 75 percent Jamaican and 25
 
01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:42.830 align:start position:0%
currently 75 percent Jamaican and 25
percent

01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
um Spanish or or Mexican
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
approximately yes you'll see in one of
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the handouts that the Jamaican consulate
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
estimates that they that uh Jamaicans on
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
40 approximately 40 or so farms and 240
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
workers I think it says I I think in the
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
state we're probably in the mid 300s and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're approaching 50 is probably
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah approaching 50 so let's
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
High 40s okay what I'm trying to clarify
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I think I heard you say that the Free
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
Trade Agreement covers those that are
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
here that come from Mexico or I'm sorry
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't clear it covers the driver's
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
licensing piece
 
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
they the the reciprocity in the
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
licensing so they don't need a a New
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license we recognize their
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mexican license or other or uh yeah
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
Mexican license in state and and they uh
 
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.410 align:start position:0%
Mexican license in state and and they uh
follow-ups

01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
follow-ups
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and they're they're recognizing that
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
license without having any agreement
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
with that other company uh country other
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
than the Free Trade Agreement that's my
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
understanding correct okay thank you
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
very much that's with Canada because of
 
01:38:56.209 --> 01:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
the three donation agreement yes
 
01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%

here as well and uh Ray was kind enough
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
to come over Ray has 17 to 18 years of
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
experience on regarding non-us
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
transactions at the DMV which are more
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
complex and deal with different forms of
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
identification so Ray is here should you
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
have any additional questions in that
 
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
have any additional questions in that
area

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to start off by saying that
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
at the DMV and I think Statewide we all
 
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
care about the farming Community we want
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
the farming industry to do well and the
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
DMV is always focused on getting to yes
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
and trying to find those areas where we
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
can partner with industry and other
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to um to make sure that
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best that we can that
 
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
we're not an obstacle and that we we're
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
a facilitator in areas where we can be
 
01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.850 align:start position:0%
a facilitator in areas where we can be
um

01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
we do have a regular community outreach
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
meetings once a month some members of
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
the committee here attend those meetings
 
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
and we make changes when there are
 
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make changes to rule to
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
law to internal practice we do that we
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
do it because it's the right thing to do
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
and there might be something that's
 
01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:50.699 align:start position:0%
changed over the years that we need to
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
take a look at and so that's always
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to be our commitment not just to
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
the farming industry but every industry
 
01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.149 align:start position:0%
the farming industry but every industry
um

01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that being said at the end of last
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
session the bill that's been spoken
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
about I believe SB 308 that was
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
referenced by Rob Johnson
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
we we recognize okay you have a lot of
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
workers that are coming in from Jamaica
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's the first time that this issue has
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
been highlighted that I became aware of
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
it and so we wanted to figure out what
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
can we do to help try to find a way to
 
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
help so
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
um what we did first was we actually met
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
with Senator waters on that bill
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
um took a look at it and actually with
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh and I believe
 
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative hill we actually got
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
together with Senator Waters uh some
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
supervisors from the DMV and we took a
 
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
look at the language from that bill uh
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
from that last session
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
um that being said I listened to
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
testimony from Senator Waters um you
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
know as far as crafting the bill and I
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
did have to pull out my phone and I
 
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back and look at my email
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I did find an email here that is
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
back from April 21st of last year and it
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually is from Senator Waters and it
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
is to uh chairman Walsh and to me and it
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
has an amendment attached to it SB 308
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment 421-22
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the email says Dear Tom and John
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
here is the amendment with the revision
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
to 263 uh 35 that John and staff
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
developed and the revision to the
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
current bill language we developed at
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
the meeting I think there is much
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
improvement uh this is a much improved
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
Bill and I'm glad that we were able to
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
include the needed change in
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
263.35 Tom can send it to OLS unless
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
there are any further thoughts David so
 
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
I I opened up what that amendment was
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
because this whole conversation going
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
back to the last session was really
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
focused on reciprocity you know I mean I
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
I've been at the DMV a little bit over a
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
year you know there are there's rsas
 
01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
such as 263 39a license for aliens
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
temporarily residing in New Hampshire
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
that governs how Visa holders are able
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
to get a license here in New Hampshire
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
and but there are exceptions to that and
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
the exception would be you could enter
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
into a reciprocal agreement with the
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
country and so we're actually before I
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
came into this position there's one
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's already started down that track
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
with Taiwan and I met with the
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
representatives from Taiwan and I'm
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
working with Department of Safety legal
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
on that recipe reciprocity agreement so
 
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:30.020 align:start position:0%
the focus for Jamaica was always
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocity because actually at that
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
meeting that representative Walsh and
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hill and Senator Waters and myself and
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
Jeff hoberdank and Kelly bruniak were at
 
01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
I actually pulled it up on my phone to
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
look at what are the licensing standards
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
in Jamaica
 
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
and um what I was pleasantly surprised
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
by was that they appear to be much more
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
stringent than they are here in New
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 21 years of age uh medical
 
01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.770 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 21 years of age uh medical
checkup

01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
checkup
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
um more a more robust uh driving portion
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the exam so when you look at
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
something like that I mean certainly the
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement is something you
 
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
can look at and say you know I think we
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
could make this work you know we could
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
take a look at how to transfer records
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
um you know how to surrender a license
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
back and forth and try to get the yes on
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
this issue but going back to that
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
attachment that Senator Waters had sent
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
to us and this is for section 2 6335 it
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
says in here or a country that has
 
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
current driver reciprocity a current
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
driver reciprocity agreement with the
 
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and then it goes
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
down to say uh in a different section
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
from a foreign jurisdiction that has a
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreement with the state of
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to give you that
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
background because that was always the
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
Focus that was always the focus the
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
focus was trying to help the Jamaican
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
workers that are coming to New Hampshire
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
which I learned today are 75 percent of
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
the guest workers coming in and helping
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
the farming industry that was always the
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
focus but the reciprocity agreement was
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
seen as the vehicle to get that over the
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
finish line and um
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
um what did we do after the last session
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
we had that meeting we worked on some
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
language regarding a reciprocity
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
agreement we also went and met with the
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
farming Community Rob was kind enough to
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
have us over to one of his regular
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
meetings over on Route 106. we went
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
there we talked to people we're invested
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
in trying to help where we can the other
 
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
thing is um supervisor Jeff oberdank
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
from the DMV had worked along with
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
supervisor Kelly bruniak to set up
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities where we could bring DMV
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
services closer to where these Farms are
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
because that was one of the things we
 
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
heard was that the transportation taking
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
the workers off the farm for the day to
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
go to Concord was a heavy lift and it
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
cost a full day's worth of work so what
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
do we do there well we tried to
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
establish transactions in Nashua which
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
was an area that was requested as well
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
as Newport
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you know and it's no fault of anybody
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
but supervisor over dank told me after
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
we tried to establish these
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to come in and
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
do that work closer to the Farms nobody
 
01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:08.060 align:start position:0%
came in
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
that being said I have good news and the
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
good news is that in the fall we should
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
be receiving a DMV mobile vehicle um
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
sorry been ordered and with that we can
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
go closer to a lot of different
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
constituents around the state and do DMV
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
transactions right out of that vehicle
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
is that something that and we talked
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
about it at the end of last session that
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
we would put front and center for the
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
I also want to talk a little bit about
 
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
my Senate testimony on this current bill
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
um you know it was uh I've received this
 
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
document this morning and I just want to
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear with the committee we
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
did offer informational testimony before
 
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
the senate committee before it got to
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
um on this bill and you know it was
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned at one point that um you know
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I supported this bill and I wanted
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
I wanted the actual notes from that
 
01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:05.060 align:start position:0%
testimony this testimony would have been
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
before the Senate Transportation
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee back on
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
January 31st of this year but it should
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
be noted that the first bullet under
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
director marasco director at New
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV first bullet says director
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
marasco said he opposed the bill on
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
technical terms however uh now that
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
there is a point of contact for Jamaica
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
who was there that day that I offered
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony and I had not met before
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
there can be discussions for license
 
01:47:32.699 --> 01:47:34.129 align:start position:0%
there can be discussions for license
reciprocity

01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
which we were absolutely thrilled about
 
01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
and that's always been the focus and now
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
we have a point of contact and we want
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
to help the Jamaican workers in the
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
farming industry here in New Hampshire
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be our commitment
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
going forward that being said this
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
current bill that you have before you
 
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.030 align:start position:0%
current bill that you have before you
um

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
some issues that we've identified with
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
Bill and by the way I did speak with
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters about this I called him
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
last night he knows what uh you know
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
what I'm testifying to in these areas
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
um it does Define different
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um statuses if you will of Visa holders
 
01:48:07.609 --> 01:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
so if you're a Visa holder coming here
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
to do contract work you still have to be
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
beholden to RSA 263 39a and go through
 
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:16.820 align:start position:0%
the DMV and get a New Hampshire license
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
if you're an international student and
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
you're here to study you still are
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
beholden to 263 39a but what we're
 
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
saying is with the h2a VISA that you are
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
not beholden to 263 39a and um and that
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
creates a discrepancy as far as how
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
those V how how those processes are
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced and not only that
 
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
it does create some challenges for the
 
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.189 align:start position:0%
it does create some challenges for the
DMV

01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
DMV
 
01:48:43.199 --> 01:48:45.229 align:start position:0%
DMV
um

01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing is when you talk about
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
records so with these reciprocity
 
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
agreements like with the one from Taiwan
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
we've met with the Taipei economic and
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
Cultural Center they don't have a um an
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
embassy or a consulate in Boston but
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is the representative for Taiwan at
 
01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.179 align:start position:0%
least in this area and we talked about
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
now granted that's with licensing but we
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
talked about how a license would be
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
surrendered you know here or in Taipei
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
we talked about how records would be
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
updated for driving and infractions both
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
here and in Taiwan
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
we talked about what the reciprocity
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
agreement would really get you and at
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it would waive the
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
road test but you'd still have to do the
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
eye test on the knowledge test so even
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the reciprocity agreement it's not
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
a uh open green light to basically
 
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
operate on a Taiwanese license here in
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it doesn't provide for
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill actually does though this
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
bill would allow anybody from any
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
country around the world to come here to
 
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:46.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on their home license
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
along with if necessary for translation
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
an international driver's license and to
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
drive on Interstate 93 89.95 for up to a
 
01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:57.890 align:start position:0%
drive on Interstate 93 89.95 for up to a
year

01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and yet we wouldn't know if that
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
person is suspended in their home
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
country we wouldn't know if they've
 
01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
committed negligent homicide with a
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle in their home country we
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
won't know we won't know that and um and
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
so even these reciprocity agreements
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
aren't just an open invitation to
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
utilize your current license and come
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
here there's still a process and it's
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
still about in the end getting a New
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license
 
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license
um

01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
like I said with Jamaica we had a pretty
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
good idea what the driving standards are
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
there to get a license and they're very
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
attractive and I think that that's why
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
we can work with Jamaica and uh the
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
consulate there and to try to help the
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
75 percent of workers that are coming in
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
but I can't necessarily say that with
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
every country around the world because
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
the licensing standards are going to be
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
different everywhere you go and um and
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if we're going
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
to allow somebody to drive on the
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
roadway for a prolonged period of time
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire law you want to
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
make sure on the public safety front
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
that you know who you're allowing to do
 
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
that based on the credential that they
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
hold and I think that to open that up
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
globally without having that information
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
I think that covers the testimony that I
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
have I'll turn it over to Mike Mercier
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
any additional information Mike yeah I
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
would just uh want to add in there even
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
though we may have 75 Jamaican workers
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
here we're we're when we're opening up
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
to Jamaicans but there are other uh
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
Spanish individuals here that could be
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
from Guatemala Mexico and right now I I
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
don't believe through the testimony that
 
01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
we've heard earlier that we we don't
 
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
have a reciprocity agreement with
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
Guatemala we don't have one with Mexico
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
so through the Free Trade Agreement
 
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
they're not getting their license here
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%

this bill is all about the h2a Farm
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
Workers but there were also other
 
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
industries that that bring in
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
Internationals uh especially the summer
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
Resort industry and the ski industry in

01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
would they well under this bill also
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
would this pertain to them
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
no it would that that would be an h2b
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that other New
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
England states have a reciprocity
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
agreement and uh New Hampshire is the
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
only one without that do you know how
 
01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.189 align:start position:0%
only one without that do you know how
their

01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
um uh their plan other states plan works
 
01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.770 align:start position:0%
um uh their plan other states plan works
and

01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
and um could we adapt some of those
 
01:53:13.739 --> 01:53:15.770 align:start position:0%
and um could we adapt some of those
positive

01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
positive
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh attributes to our plan
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
so that we can help these
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
these Farms
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
question I I do know that other states
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I've learned this through the the
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
work for the rest uh the reciprocal
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
agreement with Taiwan that other states
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
around not only New England but around
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
the country do have these reciprocal
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
agreements that they set up with
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
specific countries where they're aware
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
of what those licensing standards are
 
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I've seen them I've seen them from
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
other countries as they relate to Taiwan
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
um as far as other opportunities beyond
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
the reciprocal agreement and what's
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
going on in New England states I'm not
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
familiar with that offhand but I'd turn
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
it over to Mike and Ray for anything no
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm not familiar with the other
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
states I just know that with the
 
01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:02.219 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreement we can exchange
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
license for license from their home
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
country to ours
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that would require a reciprocal
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
agreement through the consulates in
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
order to get that program going we could
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
do some research into that
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative and get that back to you
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be very interested to see
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
how the other states are handling this
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
or specifically the concerns that you
 
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
have and how are they being handled
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can look into that
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you it actually takes one of
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
my questions as well just to see what
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing because they may not have
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
an agreement they could have just passed
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
a law like this
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
so any other questions I'll come down
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
the road representative C
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just wondering
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
if there you mentioned hb2 type Visa are
 
01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:49.340 align:start position:0%
there other types of visas that might
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
apply or be similar to something that
 
01:54:58.689 --> 01:54:58.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
um this particular one from what I get
 
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
is just to be with agriculture so I
 
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if those other visas would
 
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
director marasco good morning good
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
morning sir how are you today I'm good
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's great to see you um I have some
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
difficult questions for you I apologize
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
in advance but I feel that these these
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
questions have to be asked
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
so my first and there'll be a couple
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
follow-ups if you'll indulge with me Mr
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
chairman please
 
01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
um first question is can you tell me
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
what countries have reciprocity
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
agreements currently with New Hampshire
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
so I'm told right now sir it's Canada in
 
01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
France I have not seen the reciprocal
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
agreement with France I've asked and
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
nobody can seem to put their hands on it
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
but I'm told that those are the only two
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
countries at this time in Taiwan being
 
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the works but those are the only two
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
we currently have and do you have any
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.570 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
um

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
do you remember or do you know when was
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
the last time a country actually
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
received a reciprocal agreement from New
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm also aware that uh
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity agreement with Francis
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
one of those out there but nobody knows
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
how it happened
 
01:56:37.619 --> 01:56:41.030 align:start position:0%
how it happened
um

01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
how long have you been working at the
 
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement for Taiwan I mean
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
I know the answer but I'd like the
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee to hear the answer that's a
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
fair question
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
um that was actually started before I
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
came in
 
01:56:56.570 --> 01:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
um that was uh agreed upon uh before I
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
began back in March of of last year
 
01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
um and so it's still with Department of
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
Safety legal worked with uh attorney
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
Karen schlitzer met with the Taipei
 
01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
economic and cultural Representatives
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
that was probably about four months ago
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
maybe five months ago on the priority
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
list uh with all of the things that go
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
to Department of Safety legal we don't
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
have our own DMV attorney we used to I
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
would certainly love to have that
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity again
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
for clarity's sake though director it's
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
been years
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
I it's been I can tell you that um it's
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
been all of my tenure yeah that it's
 
01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
still it's still swirling around well I
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that it's been years okay
 
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:41.930 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that it's been years okay
um

01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
fair enough I
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
you can see the line of questioning I'm
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the DMV's point of view
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you sir
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
I think reps of sakes representative
 
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
you director for taking my question
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
um from if I can understand you
 
01:58:01.089 --> 01:58:01.099 align:start position:0%
correctly we're still working on the
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with Jamaica
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
how we're not no we haven't even started
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
it sir I haven't even started no because
 
01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
uh it was never it was never agreed upon
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
um we've never gotten to a point where
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
everybody's coming to the table and said
 
01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we want to do
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it was something after the Senate
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
hearing where we had a bona fide
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative from the consulate that
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
was there
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
um but then this bill in its current
 
01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:27.189 align:start position:0%
um but then this bill in its current
state

01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
passed Senate Transportation so we've
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
never circled back around on trying to
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
identify a reciprocity agreement okay
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
if it gets started how long did these
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
typically take to complete it's a great
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
question so we were just talking about
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the back of the room
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
um there are so many
 
01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
complex and different responsibilities
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the DMV and I can tell you that every
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
position in the DMV roughly 240
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
employees 208 full-time with a handful
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
of openings full time right now
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
um you know everybody's working at a
 
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
high level uh oftentimes multitasking
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
you really really to do this if we're
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to start looking at reciprocity
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
agreements across the board with other
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
countries you probably need a full-time
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
position or at the very least the
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
part-time position 29 and a half hours a
 
01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:18.179 align:start position:0%
week where you could have somebody just
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
focused on that that could work directly
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
with the OS legal they could check up on
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
the standards for the country identify a
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
point of contact identify like we are
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
with Taiwan okay John wants to go to
 
01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
Taipei I have to live there for nine
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
months before I can apply for a
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
Taiwanese driver's license but before I
 
01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
go I have to go to the New Hampshire DMV
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
I have to ask and request for my record
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
I have to make sure that it's certified
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of nine months when
 
01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm in Taipei I can go I can present my
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
certified record I can also at that time
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
surrender my New Hampshire driver's
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
license to the Taiwanese authorities and
 
01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:55.139 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism for them to mail it
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
back to Boston and then to have them
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
mail it back to the New Hampshire DMV
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into the
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement it can be done but
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
quite frankly there's a lot of countries
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
that would probably be eligible for this
 
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
and in order to do that though you've
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
got to have a position or two that can
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
focus on it because
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to ask employees who are
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
constantly issuing titles uh helping
 
02:00:19.609 --> 02:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
people at the counter uh issuing
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
registrations dealing with financial
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility phone calls and all of a
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
sudden take on This research it's hard
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
um so I think if we're going to make
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
this commitment moving forward I've got
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
to figure out through the next budget a
 
02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:32.540 align:start position:0%
way to
 
02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
provide for this layer of employee
 
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
support to do this
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
represent well before I go to
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
assuming you had the Manpower would you
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
need a statute or a bill to create the
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement with Taiwan or is
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
that something you could do under your
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have to check on that I think
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
the um I think the reciprocity
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
agreements let me check on that and get
 
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
you a an answer in writing fair enough
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hill
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and that took one of
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
my questions out of the way
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you director for taking my
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
questions I um
 
02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.050 align:start position:0%
questions I um
I'm

02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm still looking for a solution for
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
these guys sitting right here
 
02:01:20.099 --> 02:01:20.810 align:start position:0%
these guys sitting right here
um

02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound from what I heard from
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
you that this bill
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
is that pathway because it sounds to me
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
from what you were saying you believe
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
because of the generic nature of this
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
and and the fact that
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
um this opens it up to virtually every
 
02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:43.250 align:start position:0%
um this opens it up to virtually every
country

02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
um that it isn't the correct vehicle for
 
02:01:47.209 --> 02:01:47.219 align:start position:0%
us to do this
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to tailor this to
 
02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:56.810 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to tailor this to
specifically

02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
um a circumstance rather than
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like we're only
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
talking about one country Jamaica in
 
02:02:08.209 --> 02:02:08.219 align:start position:0%
this case is it possible to tailor this
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't
 
02:02:10.679 --> 02:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't
um

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
sour your feelings of the legislation
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to other countries
 
02:02:22.609 --> 02:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
can can we can we work with this
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
and and satisfy these guys and and the
 
02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:28.790 align:start position:0%
and and satisfy these guys and and the
department

02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you could I think if you if
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
you made this bill focused on Jamaica
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um then you certainly could you could
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
negate the need for the reciprocity
 
02:02:40.689 --> 02:02:40.699 align:start position:0%
agreement you could do it through law
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
the only problem with that not problem
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
but only consideration with that is you
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
know now it's it's is it law for every
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
every time that we want to take a look
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
at a country that we might want to have
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
might want to respect their driver's
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
license based on their licensing
 
02:02:55.739 --> 02:02:57.050 align:start position:0%
license based on their licensing
credentials

02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
um the reciprocity agreement
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
um I I want to say sir I don't think
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
that it's law on that I think it is an
 
02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:06.659 align:start position:0%
agreement based on the standards that
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
you can you do have some flexibility
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
with that I will get you that and ready
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
to confirm it
 
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
um to make sure I'm right on that but
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
um in speaking with the OS legal it
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
sounded like that was a little bit more
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
flexible so either way representative I
 
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
guess to answer your question either way
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
you could do it through this bill you
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
could do it through law you can make it
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
Jamaica focused and you could solve it
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
that way or we could take a look at the
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement and do that
 
02:03:34.609 --> 02:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up yeah follow up thank you
 
02:03:34.619 --> 02:03:36.830 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up yeah follow up thank you
um

02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
if it if it was focused if we utilize
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
this and we focused it strictly on
 
02:03:41.699 --> 02:03:43.250 align:start position:0%
this and we focused it strictly on
Jamaicans

02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
Jamaicans
 
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
um or Jamaica
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
would it necessarily entail I'm not sure
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
from this whether
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a an issued New
 
02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license or whether we're
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
allowing them to drive on their Jamaican
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
license yeah that's that's just one of
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
those areas that I think needs to be
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
this just seems too generic to me I
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's true from the from
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
your department
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a great great distinction that
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
you make there so the the rest like I
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
said with the with Taiwan uh the
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreement
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
um is still it's still to
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
um eventually uh you know you still have
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
to come to the DMV and test you still
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
have to go through the eye exam you
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
still have to do the Knowledge Test
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
there's still our standards and
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
Milestones that you have to meet after
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
the research is done to identify that oh
 
02:04:39.169 --> 02:04:39.179 align:start position:0%
the licensing standards there are
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
similar to here
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
um the nice thing about the reciprocity
 
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
agreement is it lays all that out it
 
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
lays all of it out after the research is
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
done and it says this is exactly what
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
this agreement will allow for it allows
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
you to not have to take the road test
 
02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
but these are the things that you still
 
02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
have to do whereas you'd still have to
 
02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
do that research if you're going to put
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
it into the bill
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
um but I guess you could I guess you
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
could do it that way as well and make it
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
more narrow and focused on Jamaica and
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
identify what those standards are but I
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
do think the agreement is a better way
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
to probably address it only because as
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the ones that I've seen from
 
02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
other states on Taiwan it just makes it
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear it's more of a memorandum
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
of understanding and agreement than it
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
is something that's law and in a in a
 
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:25.790 align:start position:0%
is something that's law and in a in a
bill

02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:26.450 align:start position:0%
bill
um

02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
which is going to be a little bit more I
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
think you probably have more information
 
02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
in the build than you probably need
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
whereas the agreement allows for that
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
dovetailing of different aspects of how
 
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
this is going to work but let's just my
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts off the top I'm certainly open
 
02:05:43.609 --> 02:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
to conversations on this bill and how to
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
amend it to do what an agreement would
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
do but I think the agreement probably
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions on this side of
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
the room we are running a half an hour
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
late so everybody's had a shot at it is
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
it super critical or is it an answer you
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
can get on the side at like the closest
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and move on okay thank you very
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
much gentlemen we'll be talking soon on
 
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
this with that I apologize for being a
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
little late I'm going to close the
 
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 187 and turn around and
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing within a
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
being 136 I'm going to open up the
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate bill 188.
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
relative to catalytic converters chair
 
02:08:10.089 --> 02:08:10.099 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor Senator
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
Benton glad to be back
 
02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Ladies and
 
02:08:15.890 --> 02:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen of the committee for the
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
record I am Senator Donovan Fenton to
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent District 10. I am here to
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 188 this bill
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
places a variety of record-keeping
 
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
requirements on catalytic converter and
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
scrap metal dealers and requires their
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
cooperation with law enforcement in the
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
event of a theft so what is a catalytic
 
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.410 align:start position:0%
event of a theft so what is a catalytic
converter

02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
converter
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
um a catalytic converter is part of your
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
car's exhaust system that converts
 
02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
harmful engine exhaust pollutants into
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
something less harmful to the
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
environment through a chemical reaction
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
so why are people stealing them they
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
contain three metals that Aid in the
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
chemical reaction that makes exhaust
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
less harmful and those are Platinum
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
Palladium and rhodium and these prices
 
02:08:59.450 --> 02:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
of these metals have risen dramatically
 
02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
as a result one catalytic converter is
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
worth anywhere from 150 to 1500 and can
 
02:09:08.570 --> 02:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
be signed off in a sign off of a car in
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
a matter of minutes
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
State Farm reported that in just the
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
first half of 2022 it had received more
 
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
than 23 000 catalytic converter theft
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
claims nationally and New Hampshire is
 
02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.099 align:start position:0%
no dealer no no different we are seeing
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
dealerships rental cars uh UPS
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
facilities being hit as well as cars
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
just parked on the street
 
02:09:31.010 --> 02:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
this bill would help curb the theft of
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
catalytic converters by regulating the
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
purchase of the automobile parts by
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
scrap metal dealers we're going to
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
require proof of identification and a
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
bill of sale or other document
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
indicating ownership from the sellers
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I'll take
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:49.209 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
committee

02:09:49.209 --> 02:09:49.219 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator thank you very much
 
02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
good to see you representative
 
02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.149 align:start position:0%
good to see you representative
um

02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:59.330 --> 02:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
would it would it the bill in any way or
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
do we have any assurances that uh
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
someone who steals one of these couldn't
 
02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
just take it to a scrap yard outside of
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no I mean we we can't
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdict outside of New Hampshire yeah
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
but but I will say that Most states
 
02:10:14.689 --> 02:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
around us have passed comprehensive laws
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with catalytic converters so the
 
02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
tactic here is to cut off where they can
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
sell these catalytic converters so are
 
02:10:24.050 --> 02:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
they going to steal it and now drive
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
three or four states over uh
 
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts pass a very similar law to
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
this so hopefully that'll stop them as
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
well that's the question thanks very
 
02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
well that's the question thanks very
much

02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you always
 
02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes it looks like Kyle
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
sipples from Littleton Auto saver group
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill looking for five
 
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
minutes if you can cut it to less than
 
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
we have dealerships in uh one in New
 
02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
York but mostly Vermont and New
 
02:11:08.699 --> 02:11:09.490 align:start position:0%
York but mostly Vermont and New
Hampshire

02:11:09.490 --> 02:11:09.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
and two things I wanted to address
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
number one is Vermont passed a similar
 
02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
law to the one that you're looking at
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
today and what we found is that our
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
dealerships in Vermont catalytic convert
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
converter theft went down roughly 90
 
02:11:27.169 --> 02:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
percent so the bill was tremendously
 
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
successful with one exception
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
the dealerships we own that are right on
 
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
the border of New Hampshire did not see
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
the reduction that our dealerships
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
further into Vermont saw so I it was
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
clear to us where the catalytic
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
converters were going
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so we know that that if the
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
surrounding states pass laws
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
um so Massachusetts Vermont has similar
 
02:11:49.739 --> 02:11:50.930 align:start position:0%
um so Massachusetts Vermont has similar
laws

02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
um they these are bulky items and they
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
don't like to travel far with these
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
items because it's pretty obvious what
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to say I can say from
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
our personal experience with this type
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
of legislation is it's extremely
 
02:12:07.129 --> 02:12:07.139 align:start position:0%
effective number two I think one message
 
02:12:10.930 --> 02:12:10.940 align:start position:0%
that really gets lost here uh is that
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 percent of the catalytic
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
converters we've had stolen from our
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
lots are from customers who have left
 
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
their vehicles to be serviced
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
and the shiny new cars get put on the
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
front where the police drive by
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
um but the other you know the service
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
customers cars tend to be farther back
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
we uh just this winter we had a plow
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
truck uh business sole person with one
 
02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
truck he was out of business for three
 
02:12:40.129 --> 02:12:40.139 align:start position:0%
months waiting for a catalytic converter
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
to come in there's so many are being
 
02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
stolen you've got the supply chain
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
issues we've had landscapers Carpenters
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
people that depend on their vehicles it
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
is not uncommon for them to be out for
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
two three months and literally not it
 
02:12:59.569 --> 02:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
you can't rent a plow truck at least not
 
02:13:01.970 --> 02:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
easily so it's had a tremendous impact
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
not just on businesses but consumers as
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
well so with that I'll keep my comments
 
02:13:07.199 --> 02:13:08.930 align:start position:0%
well so with that I'll keep my comments
brief

02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
brief
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
what about a test pipe but anyway any
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:13:14.689 --> 02:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
about how many are being taken are
 
02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:18.229 align:start position:0%
about how many are being taken are
stolen

02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
stolen
 
02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
so roughly it depends on the dealership
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
but it comes in waves
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
um but generally somewhere in the 15 to
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
20 a year and we're up in Littleton so
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
um I would say averaging 15 to 20 a year
 
02:13:35.569 --> 02:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at roughly three
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to replace these uh
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
depends on the size of the vehicle
 
02:13:41.229 --> 02:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's anywhere from two to five
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and we've been eating
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
02:13:45.239 --> 02:13:46.129 align:start position:0%
that cost
um

02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know how long we can but
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it has been a problem everywhere um
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you very much thank
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%

geographically New Hampshire and Maine
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in support of SB 188
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we're no stranger to this in being a
 
02:14:32.169 --> 02:14:32.179 align:start position:0%
victim of this type of illicit activity
 
02:14:35.569 --> 02:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
as a car rental company we
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
um you know similarly to delivery
 
02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
services Postal Services UPS we have a
 
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
lot of cars on a lot
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
you know left unattended uh for for
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
weekends or overnight and this activity
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's really concerning to us as a
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
business and it's it's concerning to you
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
know our employees as Citizens as well
 
02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh for for their personal vehicles
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
um since the pandemic started the
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
National Insurance crime Bureau has
 
02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
reported an increase of 1215 percent of
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
catalytic converter theft across the U.S
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Fenton had mentioned it as
 
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know there's the catalytic
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
converters have three very valuable
 
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
um Metals in their rhodium Palladium and
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
platinum and the thieves can get into
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
these cars
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh with a Sawzall and underneath it and
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
be gone in two to three minutes per car
 
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's very easy and uh we we for to to
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
cut this piece of the vehicle off and um
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're strongly in support
 
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
um one thing to let the committee know
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh similar to the previous gentleman
 
02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Vermont
 
02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:50.810 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Vermont
um

02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
main past legislation similar to this uh
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts passed legislation in
 
02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
January that's similar to what's in
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
front of the committee today
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
um in my role as a risk manager we
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
prior to that legislation in those
 
02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
States being passed we would see uh in
 
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
Maine and New Hampshire our main and New
 
02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operations
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
three to five
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
occurrences on our vehicles of theft of
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
catalytic converter per month uh in
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
Maine I believe since in in the nine
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
months since the legislation passed
 
02:16:26.649 --> 02:16:26.659 align:start position:0%
we've only seen two and in Massachusetts
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh we've only seen one in the last three
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
months so it appears to be working
 
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I would Echo the sentiments that
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
surrounding states have all enacted
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Vermont Massachusetts Maine
 
02:16:41.629 --> 02:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
they've all passed similar legislation
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
and these Rings my concern would be
 
02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
would start operating up here where the
 
02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
offloading of the stolen catalytic
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
converters would be uh easier because
 
02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's not regulated that we would see
 
02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
this activity uptick in New Hampshire
 
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
um if this uh if this does not pass
 
02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you sir questions from the
 
02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:03.830 align:start position:0%

02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of this bill a lot of this bill I
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
think is probably already written into
 
02:17:38.219 --> 02:17:39.349 align:start position:0%
think is probably already written into
law

02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
I've been cooperating with police since
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
I've been in the business I'm 48 years
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
in the scrap business
 
02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm well qualified because I
 
02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:50.780 align:start position:0%
I pretty much can
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
can sniff out or
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
be able to identify certain converters
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
that are stolen so what our what our
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
what I do when I bike analytic
 
02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
converters I get I get licenses names
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
addresses all that everything goes on a
 
02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
addresses all that everything goes on a
receipt

02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
receipt
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
everybody signs a receipt
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
comes to photographs the only time I do
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
that is if I
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
very very convinced that the converter
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
could be stolen
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
and what I do is we'll take the picture
 
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
and picture the picture of the
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
customer's license all that stuff
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
and it goes what's called leads online
 
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
which any Police Department in a state
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
can can become a part of I guess there's
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
a fee to it but once they get on leads
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
online they can see the activity that
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
we're that we have and the people that
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
we're targeting is or not targeting but
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
highlighting is possible thieves
 
02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
highlighting is possible thieves
now

02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
I think the big thing that the people uh
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
I'm going off script here
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
the big problem is drugs
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
especially in the city of Manchester and
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
the police in the Manchester are so
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with murders and stabbings
 
02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:06.650 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with murders and stabbings
Etc

02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe they really can
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
take the time
 
02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:11.450 align:start position:0%
take the time
to

02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know to follow up on a lot of the
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
converter I just went to court a week
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
and a half ago against
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
one of my customers who had sold excuse
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
me sold me stolen catalytic awareness he
 
02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
didn't steal them personally but he sold
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
them to me
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
now the record keeping
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
is not a problem with me
 
02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
the idea was when he brought him to me I
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
recognized the converters I informed him
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
that they were one of the often stolen
 
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
converter and they were getting put
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
aside now my policy has always been
 
02:19:43.679 --> 02:19:45.169 align:start position:0%
aside now my policy has always been
if

02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit of an Inkling
 
02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
the converters get put away for three
 
02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:50.330 align:start position:0%
the converters get put away for three
days

02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm very convinced they get put away
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
for seven days ten days is a little much
 
02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
people see this in a legislation and my
 
02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
doors are going to come off the hinges
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's only the certain
 
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
customers that I feel may have sold me
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
stolen material the material gets set
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
aside all by itself
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
for seven days maximum
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
I got broken into last year saving
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
catalytic converters it cost me ten
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it hurt but I'm not
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
crying about it because I do as much as
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
I can to make sure these guys don't even
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
come to me
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
so I had an agreement with the state
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
police well certain people in the state
 
02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:33.530 align:start position:0%
police well certain people in the state
police

02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
and a local police
 
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
if they had a suspect and they named
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
that suspect I mean it's not on the
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
mission of guilt for a guy but if they
 
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
name that suspect
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't be allowed in my door
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I have no problem cooperating with
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
the police but one of the biggest
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
problems I have is
 
02:20:56.809 --> 02:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
photographing everybody
 
02:20:59.090 --> 02:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's gonna that is
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's way that's that's overboard
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
if I if I got to put up with four or
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
five people at my door at a time because
 
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
it happens often and I got to start
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking pictures of everybody
 
02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:13.340 align:start position:0%
I mean that interferes with my business
 
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these people I already know
 
02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.889 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these people I already know
so

02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:18.899 --> 02:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
so
anyway

02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
one issue that I really have on this
 
02:21:23.819 --> 02:21:26.210 align:start position:0%
one issue that I really have on this
bill

02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I've been looking
 
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm extensively on this
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
where you want to make it a law that I
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
have to pay by check
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
now from everything I understand checks
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
debit cards and credit cards are not
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
considered legal tender
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
the US dollar currency is considered
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
legal tender
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
so how you can force me to pay outside
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
of tender I don't I really don't
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
understand I mean you people can do
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
whatever you want
 
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
I will do what I can to comply but as
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
far as pushing me on signing or writing
 
02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
far as pushing me on signing or writing
checks

02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
checks
 
02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
that's going to be way over the way over
 
02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:06.230 align:start position:0%
that's going to be way over the way over
it

02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:07.849 align:start position:0%
it
and

02:22:07.849 --> 02:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
Not only was it the pandemic but prices
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
in 2020 were through the roof
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
they lasted up until about
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
August or September of last year the
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
prices have gone down as much as 50 to
 
02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
60 percent on these catalytic converters
 
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
so even that
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to put it we call them
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
crack babies
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
the people that are on drugs
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
they they're getting discouraged
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
because the converters are still not
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
worth anything all right let's
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
anything else sir
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
no that's it for me thank you very much
 
02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions I did
 
02:22:54.889 --> 02:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
have one how many how many people in New
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do that your type of recycling
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
well I don't even know I wouldn't have
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
that but I mean there's there's many
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
well here's the thing because you the
 
02:23:07.250 --> 02:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
only reason I ask is you mentioned I'm
 
02:23:08.450 --> 02:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
sure you're running a reputable business
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
and and some of these would-be thieves
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
won't go to you but they're going to be
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
going someplace so I'm just looking to
 
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
see how many other businesses do this
 
02:23:18.849 --> 02:23:18.859 align:start position:0%
type of work and I can find that out
 
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me here's the issue
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I love this
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
state I grew up here
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
they're very very they've been very very
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
lenient for the most part from the time
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
I was a child the state pretty much
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
stays out of people's business
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
but the problem with this business is
 
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
it's a fair weather business
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
so when prices go high on anything
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's a scrap guy as soon as the
 
02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
prices collapse you can't find them with
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
a search warrant these people disappear
 
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
so guys like me
 
02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
I get stuff like this dropped on me
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not opposed to the bill just
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
certain sectors of the bill
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you
 
02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you
um

02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
um

02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
um plague
 
02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:39.060 align:start position:0%

calls on this issue
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we worked with Senator Fenton on this
 
02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill to create the language and what we
 
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
did was we copied the Massachusetts law
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
almost identically so that folks
 
02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be not selling a limit in New
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and just run into the scrap
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
yard in Revere so we wanted to make sure
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
that there was continuity we also looked
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
at the other approaches that were done
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
in Maine and Vermont which involved
 
02:25:08.410 --> 02:25:08.420 align:start position:0%
etching or labeling the converters
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that's uh it's it's not a
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
great solution because um
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
any etching can just be removed with a
 
02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
simple abrasive so choking off the
 
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
illegal Marketplace at the point of sale
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
was the approach to this bill
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to be too repetitive
 
02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and get into medals or anything like
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
that another data point for you all is
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
Carfax released a study that said there
 
02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
were 153 000 catalytic converter thefts
 
02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
in 2022 from Vehicles reported through
 
02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:41.270 align:start position:0%
in 2022 from Vehicles reported through
Carfax

02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
Carfax
 
02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:42.889 align:start position:0%
Carfax
um

02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't prevent the sale of of
 
02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't prevent the sale of of
legal

02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
um catalytic converter sales
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but what it does is it aims to to
 
02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:52.969 align:start position:0%
um but what it does is it aims to to
create

02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
create
 
02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and I heard from the previous speaker
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
with the opposition all it does I heard
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
record keeping is not a problem all this
 
02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
is is a record-keeping bill
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
so it allows for legal sales through a
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
simple record-keeping process in the
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
Senate there were amendments made that
 
02:26:10.849 --> 02:26:10.859 align:start position:0%
appeased law enforcement uh that dealt
 
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
with the the data Privacy Act uh it
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
appeases State Police as far as who has
 
02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over enforcement there was
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
also an amendment made that would help
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
out the auto and truck recyclers who do
 
02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
these in in massive volumes because they
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
take in whole cars and then part them
 
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
out so there was an amendment that
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
appeased them as well so
 
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
um there is federal action on the bill
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
on this issue but um who knows how long
 
02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
that could take we've been hearing about
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
it for three years with the federal
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
Parts act that involves both
 
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
record-keeping enhanced penalties but
 
02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
also an etching program the etching
 
02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
program would start at the manufacturer
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
when the vehicle is built
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
um however we uh the average age of a
 
02:27:00.770 --> 02:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
vehicle in the in the states is 12 years
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
so by the time that actually made it out
 
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace it would be years
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
and years away when this would have an
 
02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:08.090 align:start position:0%
and years away when this would have an
impact

02:27:08.090 --> 02:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
so multiple States had to just go ahead
 
02:27:12.410 --> 02:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
and take their own action
 
02:27:14.090 --> 02:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's what the proposal that you
 
02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
have um in front of you now and we hope
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
that you uh Hope to support the bill and
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
and help us kind of
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
um like as mentioned choke off this
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
illegal Marketplace
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
so thanks and I'll take any questions if
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you any questions
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
02:27:32.929 --> 02:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr so I just want to
 
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that this this bill if as it
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
is right now if I go in and sell a
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
catalytic converter to a scrap yard
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're gonna take my picture and pay me
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
by check is that correct
 
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take your picture
 
02:27:47.929 --> 02:27:47.939 align:start position:0%
they're going to take a picture of the
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
catalyst converter they're also going to
 
02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
take a photocopy of your driver's
 
02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:56.690 align:start position:0%
take a photocopy of your driver's
license

02:27:56.690 --> 02:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
and again we did hear the previous
 
02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
speaker too we won't be executing this
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
today so we'll look into all the angles
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
of this seeing none thank you very much
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%

public hearing on Senate bill 188. now
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.030 --> 02:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
11 56 I was afraid this might happen but
 
02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:21.620 align:start position:0%
we were looking pretty good for a while
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee's Choice uh we could take a
 
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
just a couple of minute break I need one
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
and push through into lunch or I can
 
02:28:30.889 --> 02:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing and
 
02:28:32.929 --> 02:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
reschedule it for after lunch how do you
 
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
all feel
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
keep going keep going okay
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right that's what I wanted to hear
 
02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to five minutes
 
02:28:43.979 --> 02:28:45.650 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to five minutes
no

02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:47.210 align:start position:0%
no
okay

public hearing on Senate bill 256.
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a safety program for off
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
Highway recreational vehicles I see it's
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
a daily fernet uh representing Senate
 
02:37:53.389 --> 02:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
award the prime sponsor
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Walsh and
 
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
Daley frenette I am the Senate majority
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
caucus director I'm here to introduce
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 256 FN which would establish
 
02:38:10.010 --> 02:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
both a lifetime and temporary safety
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
program certificate requirements for off
 
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
Highway recreational vehicles on behalf
 
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
of Senator Ward
 
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward was asked to introduce this
 
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
bill by the New Hampshire off highway
 
02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
vehicle association which represents oh
 
02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
RV clubs throughout the state who have
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
been working on trying to pass similar
 
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
legislation for three years
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation is a modified version
 
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
of previous attempts and was worked on
 
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
by stakeholders which include the
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
department of fish and game New
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Auto Dealers Association and
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill would create a phased in
 
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
approach for acquiring ohrv Riders born
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
after January 1st 1978 to take either a
 
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
lifetime permanent training a course or
 
02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
a temporary training course which would
 
02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
be valid for one calendar year
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
it would grandfather in anyone born
 
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
after 1978 and anyone who has already
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
completed an improved Fish and Game
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
training course either in New Hampshire
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
or another state
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
this year's version of the bill only
 
02:39:05.330 --> 02:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
deals with ohrvs and not snowmobiles
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
both Industries are rapidly growing and
 
02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
helping our state's outdoor recreation
 
02:39:11.929 --> 02:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
economy but this bill focus on focuses
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
on AOH RVs which rely more heavily on
 
02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
private land and especially the use of
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
public roads
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
training courses also already educate
 
02:39:21.770 --> 02:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
users on both ohrv and snowmobiles so it
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
would have a positive impact on both
 
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
user groups
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
members of our local oh RV clubs often
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
are already knowledgeable and respectful
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
of their communities this bill aims to
 
02:39:33.290 --> 02:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
try and reduce the number of Bad actors
 
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
and accidents by having young
 
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
out-of-state Riders especially renters
 
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
learn the rules on safety and to be
 
02:39:40.610 --> 02:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
better educated to respect our
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
communities and private landowners which
 
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
are vital to preserve the existing trail
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
system and valuable economic impacts
 
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
ohrvs provide the tourism and outdoor
 
02:39:52.490 --> 02:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
recreation industries of our state
 
02:39:54.170 --> 02:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
there are several amendments adopted in
 
02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
the Senate to improve this bill the
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
first amended the bill to make it clear
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
the temporary certificate would be valid
 
02:40:01.730 --> 02:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
only for one calendar year and that
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
certificate would be ready by July 1st
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
of 2024. originally uh they accompli
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
they contemplated starting the temporary
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
certificate in 2025 to give time for
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but the rental Community has
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
asked for it to be done by July 1st of
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
2024 to ensure renters born after 1998
 
02:40:19.969 --> 02:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
we'll also have to have access to
 
02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
Temporary option next season
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
the other change makes it absolutely
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
clear a safety course will not be
 
02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
required for farming employees working
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
on someone else's land stakeholders
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
believe the bill had already uh would
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
exempt this but the the language ensures
 
02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
that this will not uh there will not be
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
any confusion
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward asks for your support for
 
02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
the passage of Senate Bill 256 to help
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
ensure Riders are better equipped to
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
operate their vehicles and help preserve
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
safety on our thriving public and
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
private trail system in the state thank
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak today I
 
02:40:51.530 --> 02:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
will defer any questions to the
 
02:40:54.770 --> 02:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and fish and game thank you
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.849 --> 02:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes Mike Willette
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
he's been here for a while representing
 
02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
metallak ATV Club I hope I'm saying that
 
02:41:16.450 --> 02:41:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chairman and the
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support the bill and I'm
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
here today to talk about the club's
 
02:41:28.969 --> 02:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
point of view my name is Mike Willette I
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
live in Colebrook I'm a representative
 
02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
from Co-op District three I'm also the
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
trail administrator for metallic ATV
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
Club where the largest at Club in the
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
state with over a thousand members and
 
02:41:45.650 --> 02:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years in the North
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
Country we've lost about 5 000
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing jobs so our economy has
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
changed from a manufacturing logging
 
02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
economy to a tourist-based economy
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
so ohrv is a big part of our economy
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
there are over a thousand let me
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
rephrase that there's over between 12
 
02:42:08.450 --> 02:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
and 1300 miles of trails in the state of
 
02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire oh RV trails with a
 
02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
thousand of them being in the North
 
02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's got such an economic impact and I'm
 
02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
going to quote you some numbers I'm not
 
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
saying they're 100 correct but
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
my last reading that's what they were
 
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
skiing in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
brings about 550 million dollars of
 
02:42:29.530 --> 02:42:29.540 align:start position:0%
economic impact into the state
 
02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling is around 500 million and
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
the last study I saw with the ohribs
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's 440 million dollars of economic
 
02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
impact in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
annually so it's very important part of
 
02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
our North Country economy
 
02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:45.050 align:start position:0%
our North Country economy
the

02:42:45.050 --> 02:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
I won't go through the technical part of
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
the bill but this mandatory safety
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
course is very similar to the very
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
successful snowmobile course that's been
 
02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
going on for decades in state of New
 
02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:55.370 align:start position:0%
going on for decades in state of New
Hampshire

02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
the main problems we have with safety
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
in both Sports usually is because
 
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
inexperience and speed
 
02:43:05.090 --> 02:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
and this bill will help Target the
 
02:43:07.730 --> 02:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
inexperienced Riders and also
 
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
educate the aggressive young adults out
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
there writing that need some education
 
02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
there are some challenges right now that
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
ohrv is currently face
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
and one of the biggest problems is
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
landowners and cultivating cooperating
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
landowners to open their land and also
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
to allow us to have trails
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
a writer can come up into the North
 
02:43:38.690 --> 02:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
country and write 100 miles
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
very easily never see a house never see
 
02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
a camp
 
02:43:44.210 --> 02:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
most riders that come in that area that
 
02:43:46.610 --> 02:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
ride those kind of distances think the
 
02:43:49.490 --> 02:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
land is public it's not
 
02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:50.809 align:start position:0%
land is public it's not
um

02:43:50.809 --> 02:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:52.849 --> 02:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
more than in the North Country over 90
 
02:43:58.610 --> 02:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:02.210 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:44:02.210 --> 02:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
some of the problems we have with riders
 
02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
leaving trash riding off Trail creating
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
ruts when it's wet not a following or
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
obeying science and excessive noise and
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
dust and what I think this bill can
 
02:44:17.399 --> 02:44:18.590 align:start position:0%
dust and what I think this bill can
accomplish

02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's just a few things that are very
 
02:44:22.849 --> 02:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
very important it can reduce accidents
 
02:44:26.330 --> 02:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
and and injuries just through education
 
02:44:28.250 --> 02:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to educate writers how to
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
respect the landowners and understand
 
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
the crucial role they play in the sport
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
without Cooperative landowners we have
 
02:44:35.929 --> 02:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
no sport
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's that important
 
02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's also going to educate writers how
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
the clubs fit into this program
 
02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:46.580 align:start position:0%
I know our club in the last two years
 
02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
rerouting a trail we spent 370 thousand
 
02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
dollars building a trail a single Trail
 
02:44:56.090 --> 02:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
to avoid some Road sections get away
 
02:45:00.010 --> 02:45:00.020 align:start position:0%
from houses and a piece some landowners
 
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
the club's share of that 370 000 was
 
02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
over two hundred thousand dollars
 
02:45:08.929 --> 02:45:08.939 align:start position:0%
the state share was around 170 000.
 
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
so the clubs have a very important part
 
02:45:14.690 --> 02:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
in the sport most
 
02:45:16.849 --> 02:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
riders that come up don't realize how
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
important that part is
 
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
so it's important for them to learn
 
02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
the importance and
 
02:45:26.330 --> 02:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
of the landowners and how crucial they
 
02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:27.050 align:start position:0%
of the landowners and how crucial they
are

02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:45:28.969 --> 02:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
to understand how the clubs fit in
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
cultivating Trails building trails and
 
02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
retaining landowners
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
the uh a lot of writers do not
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
understand that the bureau Trails has a
 
02:45:45.050 --> 02:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
big part in this through their Grant aid
 
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:47.660 align:start position:0%
program and helping the sport
 
02:45:50.929 --> 02:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
and a lot do not understand the roles of
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game
 
02:45:55.130 --> 02:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
and and how they fit in this with their
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
registrations event permits and law
 
02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.429 align:start position:0%
registrations event permits and law
enforcement

02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:46:00.770 --> 02:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there's no downside to
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill there's a small inconvenience
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
to varieters to take their safety course
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
but it'll improve the sport and and help
 
02:46:11.389 --> 02:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
protect it I hope that you will support
 
02:46:12.770 --> 02:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:46:14.750 --> 02:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
committee representative C
 
02:46:21.050 --> 02:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:46:24.290 --> 02:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question on page two of the
 
02:46:27.290 --> 02:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
bill they talk about uh operator Danny's
 
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
birth and certificate retired or those
 
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
honored before or on or after dates it
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say so it
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
as I read it it means only if you were
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
born on that particular January 1st that
 
02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
it applies I'll I'll let Lieutenant
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
Eastman uh stand at the technical part
 
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
of it but from what I understand it was
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
for for people who were born a certain
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
date in 1978 or later
 
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
if you're born pre-1978 you will not
 
02:46:56.270 --> 02:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
have to be part of the safety course
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that's to Target the young
 
02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
any further questions and
 
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
all set
 
02:47:06.660 --> 02:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
all set
okay

02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I just want one one statement for me
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
I can do that on the chair did you say
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
it's uh the metallic ATV Club yes and I
 
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
apologize for my pronunciation but so
 
02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
everybody knows in my own defense it's
 
02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:20.950 align:start position:0%
everybody knows in my own defense it's
spelled

02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
spelled

m-e-t-a-l-l-a-k so thank you for that
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman Walsh and
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name for the
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
record is Rich Parsons I work at ryp
 
02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
Granite strategies here in Concord and I
 
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire off highway
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle association we represent 25
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
ohvere clubs throughout the state and I
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
think it was alluded to earlier that
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
we've been working on something for
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
several years to try and get something
 
02:48:21.730 --> 02:48:21.740 align:start position:0%
to work I know the first version was
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
based primarily on the boater safety
 
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
certificate program which has been very
 
02:48:28.849 --> 02:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
successful but this takes a bit of a
 
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
different approach it's a little bit of
 
02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
a hybrid for example Vermont has a born
 
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
after date that you're required to get
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
it so this takes a phased in approach
 
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
sort of like the boater safety program
 
02:48:42.130 --> 02:48:42.140 align:start position:0%
but also a born after date
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative in on page two line 15 it
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
does say it says no person born after so
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
I think it um should be assumed that
 
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
those dates are if you're born after
 
02:48:57.950 --> 02:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
that date if you're born on January 1st
 
02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
itself that obviously would be a little
 
02:49:01.969 --> 02:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
confusing for you
 
02:49:01.979 --> 02:49:02.630 align:start position:0%
confusing for you
um

02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I but I think it's supposed to be if
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
you're born after those days
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
um so some information we have
 
02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of the folks that this would
 
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
impact in 2024 under 25 based on 20 22
 
02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
registrations it'd be roughly
 
02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
six and a half percent of all Riders
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
were under the age of 25 that would have
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
to complete or have something done in
 
02:49:30.610 --> 02:49:30.620 align:start position:0%
2024 I think it was 996 residents in
 
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
1008 non-residents from there the year
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
after would be 16 and a half percent of
 
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
users and 36 to 45 which would be in
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
2026 is about 19 and a half percent of
 
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
users I mean the over 46 plus crowd it
 
02:49:51.530 --> 02:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
makes up 57.7 percent of users so the
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
majority of users wouldn't be impacted
 
02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
by this and I think it's also important
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
to note that if you have already taken
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
a course you can use that as your
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
lifetime certificate whether in the
 
02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or one recognized
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
by fish and game so there should be a
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
good amount of people especially those
 
02:50:11.870 --> 02:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
under the age of 25. most of them likely
 
02:50:13.849 --> 02:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
took when they if they started when they
 
02:50:16.429 --> 02:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
were youth they likely took our safety
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
training program already and fish and
 
02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
game has records on on all those folks
 
02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
that took it
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's been mentioned already so
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'll just quickly just say
 
02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
um you know our association supports
 
02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation you know especially
 
02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
with our use in Reliance on private
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
lands we think
 
02:50:36.410 --> 02:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
Riders especially renters could benefit
 
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
from additional etiquette to ride on
 
02:50:40.849 --> 02:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
these trails that these landowners are
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
nice enough to allow us to use and also
 
02:50:46.010 --> 02:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
for when they're riding on roads because
 
02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
roads are much different some of these
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles the tire pressure
 
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
makes it unique in that they need to
 
02:50:53.809 --> 02:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
understand that it's going to ride
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
differently when it's on a road so the
 
02:50:58.610 --> 02:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
goal is to reduce accidents you know
 
02:51:00.490 --> 02:51:00.500 align:start position:0%
increase etiquette for folks to help
 
02:51:03.050 --> 02:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can continue to have a
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
thriving economy from these vehicles in
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the North country and other parts of the
 
02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:07.790 align:start position:0%
the North country and other parts of the
state

02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:51:10.610 --> 02:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll take any questions
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I just got one to
 
02:51:15.770 --> 02:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
start off excuse me I don't disagree
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
with representative C and I agree with
 
02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
you that I think it's assumed that after
 
02:51:22.849 --> 02:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
is what what's being intended you've
 
02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
been working on the language on this
 
02:51:26.690 --> 02:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
because can you find a different way to
 
02:51:28.849 --> 02:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
maybe clarify that because I agree with
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
them yes you can't really pass something
 
02:51:32.809 --> 02:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
that we assume is
 
02:51:34.730 --> 02:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
what we want it's kind of going to be
 
02:51:36.290 --> 02:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
spelled a little clearer than that so
 
02:51:38.330 --> 02:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
that would be appreciated any other
 
02:51:39.770 --> 02:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative Jones
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you sir
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:45.429 align:start position:0%
for being here
um

02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
under this category does
 
02:51:50.210 --> 02:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
are we including two-wheel three-wheel
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
and four-wheel
 
02:51:54.290 --> 02:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
anyone that is required to have yeah an
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
or HRV registration that that gets one
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
on the state so it's trail bikes two
 
02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
bikes two wheels three wheels four
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
wheels yeah utvs all those are included
 
02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
and can I just ask you what is a gator
 
02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:08.750 align:start position:0%
and can I just ask you what is a gator
uh

02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:10.610 --> 02:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
Captain Eastman I think can probably
 
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
answer that in a little more detail I've
 
02:52:14.210 --> 02:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
never ridden on a Gator myself it's a
 
02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
it's a name brand oh okay thank you
 
02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative sellers uh thank you Mr
 
02:52:23.929 --> 02:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
chair and to me being here and I might
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
not have read it yet and my apologies
 
02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:27.050 align:start position:0%
not have read it yet and my apologies
but

02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
how how much does this training course
 
02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
gonna cost an individual and how many
 
02:52:34.730 --> 02:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
hours or how much time they have to put
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
into it
 
02:52:38.929 --> 02:52:38.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so the in-person training courses
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
are free that you can sign up for one of
 
02:52:43.849 --> 02:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
the ones offered by a fish and game or
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
an approved training course
 
02:52:48.110 --> 02:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
um if you are doing the temporary
 
02:52:49.849 --> 02:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
certificate that is contemplated in the
 
02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
bill that'll be offered
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
um through an approved program at a
 
02:52:57.530 --> 02:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
location so I believe that is also free
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
the online course that is offered now I
 
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
think is 35 if you want to take an
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
online course in terms of the time I
 
02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
think it's a temporary
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I'll let Captain Eastman correct me
 
02:53:12.410 --> 02:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong here would be
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
you know 30 minutes to an hour probably
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
closer to an hour
 
02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
whereas the lifetime certificate is like
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
a five to six hour intensive class in
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:31.610 --> 02:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none you're off the hook
 
02:53:35.690 --> 02:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
next up share recognizes Captain Eastman
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%

02:54:12.290 --> 02:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
and the capability of my agency to
 
02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
and the capability of my agency to
handle

02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
handle
 
02:54:15.790 --> 02:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
um this uh this course
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
as uh Mr Parsons said we do have a we we
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
have had for a very long time a live
 
02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:23.530 align:start position:0%
have had for a very long time a live
course

02:54:23.530 --> 02:54:23.540 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:54:26.210 --> 02:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
which has a minimum of five and a half
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
hours of training it's generally a day I
 
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
have Regional coordinators and
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers that that put those on across
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
the state and they can be signed up for
 
02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
online through our website we also have
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
through calcamy our online platform
 
02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
which has been around
 
02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:48.490 align:start position:0%
which has been around
for

02:54:48.490 --> 02:54:48.500 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
at least five years I take that back at
 
02:54:55.849 --> 02:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
least six to eight years I'm not 100
 
02:55:00.050 --> 02:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
sure one that was incepted but that uh
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
34.95 course
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and that is none of that a fee comes
 
02:55:10.969 --> 02:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
back to my agency that is for calcamy to
 
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
maintain that platform
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
so that was is out there it can be done
 
02:55:19.969 --> 02:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
I've I've spoken with folks that uh did
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
it in the amount of time to drive from
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island to the state to actually uh
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
to go and and use
 
02:55:28.690 --> 02:55:28.700 align:start position:0%
um the uh the ohrv trails in our state
 
02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh and that can be done at
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
any time I re the last I reviewed it
 
02:55:38.269 --> 02:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
um was last year and uh just looking at
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
it took me about about three hours to
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
complete that and that would be your
 
02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
your course for
 
02:55:46.490 --> 02:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
um or you'll get your card in the mail
 
02:55:49.610 --> 02:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
from calcamy and be good for it's a
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
lifetime card as far as the um
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
the temporary course which was something
 
02:55:58.610 --> 02:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
that the um the rental dealers looked
 
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
for us to to put in
 
02:56:04.250 --> 02:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
um that uh we would need to work with
 
02:56:07.309 --> 02:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
calcium to get that online so that they
 
02:56:09.170 --> 02:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
could um so that a person could just go
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
online and and and take that course and
 
02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
be ready for uh and be ready to to come
 
02:56:16.849 --> 02:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
and and what it would really be designed
 
02:56:18.650 --> 02:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
for is that if I were coming to the
 
02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
North country or anywhere in the state
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
where I was going to rent a an ohrv that
 
02:56:26.450 --> 02:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
I would be able to do that prior to
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
coming to the state or I could do it at
 
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
the rental agent and we would look in my
 
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
mind about an hour course so
 
02:56:36.769 --> 02:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
um and get them out there and that would
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
be heavy on etiquette
 
02:56:42.410 --> 02:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and and laws and and rules of the
 
02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
road that type of thing
