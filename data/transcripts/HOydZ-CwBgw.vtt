00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
also this uh law was passed in 2001 and
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
since then we have learned that the
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
government has used many Avenues to get
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
citizens personal data article 2B was uh
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
proposed and pass with overwhelming
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
support to help address the government
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
overreach and this law specifically
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
states that customer information from
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
your telephone and interet companies
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
must be handed over to the government
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
upon request and without a search
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
warrant I ask the AG's office for um how
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
many of these requests have gone out
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
since we amended our Constitution and
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
they uh turned that into a um 91a
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
request so they will get back to me in
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh by April 9th um so can't tell you at
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
the scope of the issue currently but um
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
its effects are
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
still um being had even if it's not
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
being actively used um my example of
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
this is the law is cited in state V Melo
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
which the Supreme Court uh let evidence
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
stand which was obtained based on a
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
warrant for which the warrant was later
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
thrown out and the court effectively
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
said that the information could be
 
00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519 align:start position:0%
attained without a warrant so no warrant
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
was required essentially opening this
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
information up to any agency as it
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't the AG that got the uh warrant in
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
thisa in the case that they were uh
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
talking about so as the legislature
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
flushes out what the
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
information um and uh personal
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
information is protected under article
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
2B I ask that you protect um you know
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
the customers's names and addresses and
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
billing records and more uh and close
 
00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:27.790 align:start position:0%
billing records and more uh and close
this

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
loophole to our um government to gather
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh private information without a warrant
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
and I thank you and am happy to answer
 
00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:41.150 align:start position:0%
and I thank you and am happy to answer
any

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative thank you for
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative B you
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question thank you Mr
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
question uh today it requires uh the
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
written demand of the Attorney General
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
to uh uh request this information
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
um which seems like be more difficult to
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
get than a uh search warrant uh search
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
warrants are uh routinely given by
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.030 align:start position:0%
 
case

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
so the the question of whether it's
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
easier or not I would go towards what is
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the standard for such a request so in
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
I would say that the standard is
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
probable cause whereas a demand it just
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general just needs
 
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.509 align:start position:0%
the attorney general just needs
reasonable

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
grounds um so I think that's a lower
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
standard to to reach and so that is um
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
my focus
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
of not necessarily whether it can be
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
handled by a phone call or whether it
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be a written demand but the
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
standard that is used and the the hurdle
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
that the um or the standard which the
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
government might use to be able to get
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
that customer information so thank you
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
for the question thank
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative the chair could inquire
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
question and I want to thank you in
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question uh are
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
you can you answer this whether does a
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
common carrier of the the communications
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
common carrier do they have absent
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
search for can they refuse the request
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
General so no th this is a shall um they
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
have to give so in in
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
um it says shall furnish to the attorney
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
general so there is no refusal if the
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
asks thank
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
you representative B you were recognized
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
testimony if I'm understanding correctly
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is only for you know my home
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
phone or cellier service not social
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
media or Google searches is that
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question so
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
common carrier is um defined in the
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
referenced RSA and um I don't believe
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
that it would uh so let's let me just
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
read the definition a person engaging in
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
or providing communication services to
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
the general public through transmission
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
of any form of information between
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
subscribers by means of wire cable radio
 
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.870 align:start position:0%
subscribers by means of wire cable radio
or

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic uh transmission Optical
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
or Fiber transmission or other means
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
which transfers information without
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
physical transfer of a medium whether to
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
be switched or or dedicated facility
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
and then it it carves out um radio and
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
television broadcast or any other
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
General Distribution of form of
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
communication s not be deemed
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
communication carrier So based on my
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
reading of that technically you are
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
giving the um you are
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
transferring um information between
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
people um probably via Optical or Fiber
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
Optic transmission since that's what
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
we're using to send stuff through the
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
internet so I think that it might
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
be it might be encompassing uh social
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
media all right thank
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
you representative expain you recognize
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and I thank
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the member for taking my question um can
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
you tell me what the in my understanding
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
of this this is currently only the AG
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
that can then make this request which
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
would mean that the AG
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh is typically only handling criminal
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
things can you tell me if there's bleed
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
through with a warrant that would open
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
this to civil actions and then also open
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
up such Avenues as um civil actions
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
within family courts divorce proceedings
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
like thank you for the question so in
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
the RSA Tech um the AG can designate
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
both the county attorneys and um in
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
certain rsas to enforce certain rsas and
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
um the assistant AG to be able to make
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
such demands also uh the bleed through
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm seeing to to other agencies is
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruling that if you can
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
get this information without a search
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
warrant that the um the law enforcement
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
agency which is not the AG was able to
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh essentially have this information
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
without a warrant introduced into a case
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of bleeding the line
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
of it just is the AG to pretty much
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else um that is a law enforcement
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
agency I don't think I I have any
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's bled all the way into
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
um civil cases though follow
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
up you recog ask for a followup question
 
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so under current law
 
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so under current law
um

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
in a a civil action such as a small
 
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.629 align:start position:0%
in a a civil action such as a small
claims

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
action say a builder who taking action
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
against somebody who refused to pay or
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
what have you any of that would not be
 
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
accessible a builder could not uh as
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
part of his small claims action demand
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
that the cell phone records and Media
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
Records of the person that they're suing
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
be turned over to them
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
um by
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
lowering this to a warrant standard then
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
if the small claims court the lower
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
court decided a warrant was appropriate
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
they gave a warrant they could actually
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
demand all the electronic records from
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in something as simple as a
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
small claims case or even in a divorce
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
case or the like is that not
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
true thank you for the question I don't
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
believe this opens up any additional
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
Avenues because currently if a if a
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
judge wants to
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh Grant a search warrant for these
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
companies that that would still be um
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
honored so it's currently allowed it's
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
just um to to uh for people to be
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
subject to search warrants so I think
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's only um
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
re uh making sure that something below
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
suspicion or uh the requirements of a
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
search warrant are met so right now it's
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
the AG just needs to have a suspicion of
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
something that might have been
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
criminal happening and so for the demand
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
whereas Reasonable Doubt has a higher
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
standard so thank you for the
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
question representative Muse you
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
recognized yes thank you for taking my
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
question um I'm wondering how your bill
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
addresses uh location data
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and potentially uh things like
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
real-time pinging uh by police officers
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
which are uh requests that uh that will
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
carriers thank you for the question we
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually have another law that deals
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
with um information data but uh this
 
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
with um information data but uh this
this

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't this bill does not address that
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
as it is not
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
um uh it is so the the bill actually or
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
the RSA lists a specific number of
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
things that the people can request and
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
location data isn't one of them so I
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it's within the scope
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
of this RSA I think it's it's in a
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
different RSA but thank you for the
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Newman you
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
recogniz thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
you to the witness taking my my question
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
would this have any effect on um what I
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
I when I read an article trying to
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
figure out what this bill meant it
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
talked about geofencing where they get
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
mega dat within a specific geographic
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
area like they're doing on the
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
Insurrection at the capital would this
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
have any effect on the Gathering of that
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
kind of information that originally is
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
only the location and then based on that
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
they get I I'm not sure whether they
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
have to get a search warrant or not to
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
get the additional information like that
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
would this affect that particular
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
activity so since since this was uh is
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
very similar to the last question and
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
what is covered so in the RSA it says
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
um that they shall furnish um names
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
addresses of persons who are stated
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
listed or unlisted telephone numbers uh
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
phones and
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
addresses of um anyone with a identified
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
server Serv anyone uh any local or
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
longdistance billing
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
records uh telephone customers Service
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh Records um the length of the service
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
provided um the types of Services
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers so it I think this is
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
really um focused on trying to get uh
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
people's telephone numbers and and other
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
subscriber like billing records I don't
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that it would it's not
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned like Geo fencing
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
or location data and that is
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
specifically addressed in our say 644a I
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
believe uh the regulations around
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
location data and so I think that would
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
be is the I think it's probably outside
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
of the scope of this as as it doesn't
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
specifically carve out um exception to
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
644a thank you for the question thank
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
GA thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question if this became law
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
this bill what impact would this have
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
would have had on um getting the records
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
of those of the Insurrection that
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
capital thank you for the question I I
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
believe this was very similar to the
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
last question um nothing I don't believe
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
no this is the uh so I just described
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
the the types of things and first and uh
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
that would be covered under this and
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
location data is is governed by a
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
different RSA thank you for the
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
you your hand is raised you have another
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:34.750 align:start position:0%
you your hand is raised you have another
question

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
question seeing no further hands raised
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the representative for
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me representative true thank
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
question could
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
you could you give me some uh examples
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
information on my
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
phones somebody would want that they
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't have access to already just I
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
concrete examples of what information
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
for thank you for the question um so in
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the case of the state V Melo they were
 
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.029 align:start position:0%
the case of the state V Melo they were
asking

00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
for essentially they had an i IP
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
address and they were asking for you
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
know the name address phone number etc
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
etc of that person uh based on the IP
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
address so like the same thing would be
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
like if they had your telephone number
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
if you called
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
someone and um the the the AG or whoever
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency was trying to
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
track down who who this phone number
 
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
track down who who this phone number
belongs

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
belongs
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
to they would try and go to a specific
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
agency and say okay give me all of the
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
records that you have for this phone
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
number kind of a thing and so they would
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
be getting that data that way does that
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands raised I
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
want to again thank the representative
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
excuse

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
for any members of the public who who
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that are in attendance

please raise your hand at this time uh
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this hearing
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony will be limited to two minutes

Dean whoops thank you very much chairman
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
um my name is Penny Dean I'm an attorney
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
and I believe that there's rampant abuse
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
of this this is a
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
basically a fishing Expedition license
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
his designes and to answer the question
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
about what information imagine any of us
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
has a
smartphone

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
smartphone
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
and handing it to someone else and allow
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
them to fish through it to see the
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers you called the amount
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
of time you talk to them the frequency
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
at which you talk to them the numbers
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
you called your text messages your
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
emails what you search and at least my
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
concern always is in general but for gun
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
owners if you want to see who gun owners
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
are talking to who the other gun owners
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
are what gun shops I'm calling maybe to
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
buy firearms um that is a real problem
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
and right now there is absolutely no
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
basis for the Attorney General as a
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
practical matter um restricting them
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
from asking for this information when
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
they send a request over the common
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
carriers click their heels and hand it
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
to them on a silver
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
platter and that is simply not right
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's in my mind a Fourth Amendment
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
violation and the carriers are complicit
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid of government
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
regulation and so or abuse if you will
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
of Regulation passing a law like this is
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to give us a little bit of
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
protection and making the Attorney
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
General's office or their designate go
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
before in theory a neutral and detached
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
Magistrate that has to have an affidavit
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
signed under oath and so one of the
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
representatives that asked that this
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
would be lowering the standards
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely not this is protection I see
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
this as raising the
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
standards and I see this as making an
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
example that they cannot simply get
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
around the Constitution by laws like
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
this which is really what's been
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
happening and it's unfortunate and so
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is if they think
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
someone's breaking the law if they have
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause or any type of basis they
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
should be able to put it in an affidavit
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
where an officer has to sign under oath
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
under the pains and penalties of perjury
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
not just I think or maybe baby I have
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
disinformation chairman I have a
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
question the witness is over two
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
minutes out of
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
order you not recognize to speak please
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
don't interrupt the testimony of witness
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh although testimony for members of
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
public is limited to two minutes it is
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
within the discretion of the chair to
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
allow it to go beyond
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
that you are the first it's been like
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
that throughout the entire term you're
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
the first person member of this
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
committee to complain about this so
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
please if you wish to speak you must
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and be
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
recognized I apologize to the the member
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the public testifying may continue
 
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
of the public testifying may continue
your

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you chairman so I see
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
this as being more protective for
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
consumers and more protective in general
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
because the at I will be surprised if
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General on April 9th at the
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion of when the representatives
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
WR to no request truly responds with
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
complete information I think the
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee should look at what the
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
response is and then talk to the
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
criminal defense spyer and suggest that
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll be shocked if all the
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
information is given I think that what
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to see is the attorney
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
general is going to claim there's
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigations that this would
 
00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:27.950 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigations that this would
compromise

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that will be accurate
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that will be one of their
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
grounds for not giving all complete
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
information under 91a so I'd
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
respectfully say that even if a person
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
isn't a gun owner I don't care if you're
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
a dog owner or a whatever you are you
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
don't want your entire circle of friends
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
being identified by name and number and
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
being harassed your suspended we do have
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
to do testimony oh thank thank you I
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
apologize I'll wrap up I would
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to pass
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's a good bill and
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions and
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker or
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I want I want to thank thank
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and if the chair
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
can inquire of a question uh and I want
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
to thank you in advance for taking my
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
question in regards to the the
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
communications of the the data that that
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
we're referencing uh my question is is
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
who owns that that data and I what I'm
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
getting at is I understand there's a
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
that my question is would a warrant be
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
the resolution that because the common
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
carrier is a is a third
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
party thank you thank you for your
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
question um the the common carrier is a
 
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
question um the the common carrier is a
third

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
party and I can't say that I've seen
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
every cell phone or common carrier
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
agreement but I like everyone else have
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
switched carriers over the years every
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
carrier that I've ever signed the
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
agreement with nobody reads the
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
agreement except for geeky lawyers like
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
me and it provides that the carrier owns
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
the data at least the ones that I've
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
looked at and so I can't imagine that
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
all the others don't provide the same
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
thing but even though they own the data
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
and so you normally say well that's not
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
a Fourth Amendment violation when the
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
data is being coerced which essentially
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
is by the
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
AG the person doesn't even know their d
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
has been accessed and that's what's
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
really troubling because if I knew that
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
let's say Verizon gave my data up to the
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
AG I might switch to a different carrier
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I might want to know what had been
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
given to the AG and why and so they have
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount of data the other
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
thing is when private attorneys will
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
subp like for example I would subpoena
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
um phone records I do it all the time
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's amazing the the common carriers
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
will tell me oh we don't have it past 30
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
days or 60 days or whatever their
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
arbitrary limit is at a given time yet
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
if the cops go get it they can get it
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
for years back so the common carriers do
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
not treat defense attorneys the same way
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
they do the
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and that that's a that's a
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
problem and most clients you can't
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
afford the average client cannot afford
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
to litigate against Verizon or AT&amp;T
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're a
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
monster you know thank you and and if I
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
may take my question if I may inquire of
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
a follow
 
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.669 align:start position:0%
a follow
question

00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
so would would you believe or would you
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
agree that it's a a potential Fourth
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment violation to require the
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
common carriers to
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
surrender the information or the data
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
that without the requiring of a warrant
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
I mean I suppose AT&amp;T or Verizon wanted
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
to decline the request made by the
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's they don't need a warrant they
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
they basically have to surrender it
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
they they do have to surrender it right
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
now and a lot of them are afraid not to
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the people in Black robes
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
because um AT&amp;T is not a government
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
entity or the common carriers are not a
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
government entity they don't see it as a
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment violation I do but
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
here's what I remind people until heler
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
came down the black robes in this
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
country didn't say we had an individual
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
right to keep and bear arms it wasn't
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
until heler and McDonald that the court
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that right so courts are not
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
always right but un I agree that it is a
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment violation chairman but
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
do thank you again for taking my
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
question representative B you recognize
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
if I may also you know be recognized in
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
a minute for a followup but my first
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
question um attorney Dean is you've
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
already answered part of it that they
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
can subpoena my records or not subpoena
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
they can um the AG can request and get
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
my records or anybody's records from
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
carrier is there a way that I could find
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
if that has been done or is it a secret
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
I will never
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
know it is a secret um I would be
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
shocked if you're able to find that out
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
because law enforcement always puts this
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
Cav add in um that this is a law
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement matter and you could
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
compromise an investigation and blah
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
blah blah so I have had clients that we
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
know the records were obtained by law
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement because we got them in
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
Discovery and when they called their
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
carrier their carrier like we don't know
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about and all I
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
could think of is liar liar pants on
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
fire but you can't make them give you
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
that information so I would say I would
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
be shocked if you found
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
out thank you
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman representative you
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
are recognized for a followup question
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up question um as I
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
read the bill it's it's obvious it's for
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
landlines um you know Etc like that but
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
does it also include social media
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
Facebook in Google searches you know
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
would it incorporate
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative I think it would if it's
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
used from your smartphone because data
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
is data so in other words if if you take
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
most people's smartphone that I've ever
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
seen they have an internet connection on
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
it and they run all sorts of searches
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
through that phone and it's all through
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
your phone service that that is run so I
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine that it wouldn't include
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
that I can't say how each um company
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
keeps their data but I cannot imagine it
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be part and parcel of that and
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
so for example you take someone like
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
like me depending on what case I'm
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
working on there is a two-year period
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
where I did a lot of research on hand
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
grenades now hand grenades if you file a
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
form four are perfectly lawful to own in
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
my case I was doing research on them
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
because of a case not because I wanted
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
to do anything illegal but I do through
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
intellectual curiosity and through my
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
practice a lot of searches that someone
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
may take umage at her suggest oh she
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
must be looking to break the
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.069 align:start position:0%
must be looking to break the
law

00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
you see seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for for her testimony
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me there is a
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
member of the public with a hand raised
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's only a phone number so just
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
please identify yourself for the record
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
by stating your full name where you're
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
from and whether you're testifying in
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
support or in opposition to House Bill
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.069 align:start position:0%
support or in opposition to House Bill
539

00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.079 --> 00:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
morning uh this is Jay simpin 20 cabit
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
Drive nashille New
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I hope this bill will be
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
enacted and thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for hearing my
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I'm an international
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
economic consultant uh so I think of
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
data as plural not a singular key point
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
is this data are
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
lethal the idea that data and data
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
security is about privacy is simply
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
wrong a recent example from The Wider
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
World early in January 19 uh
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
2020 an Iranian General arrived at the
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
airport in Bagdad Iraq
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
he w got into his car to leave and was
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
then killed by two drone fired missiles
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
what has this to do with common carriers
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is this the only
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
thing that the United States needed to
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
know was where that Iranian General
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
would be and when he would be there our
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
telephones re Smartphones at any rate
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
regularly ping
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
cell towers so that if a call comes in
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
it will be clear how it should be
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
routed that information called cell site
 
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.069 align:start position:0%
routed that information called cell site
lator

00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
lator
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
information is for individuals the
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
equivalent of law enforcement putting a
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
GPS device on a vehicle to track it in
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
order to put such a device on a vehicle
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement have to get a search
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
warrant why because they are seeking
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
information that is private about a
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
person so they have to go to a judge or
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
a magistrate show that they have
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause to need to imp place a
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
GPS cracking device on a vehicle and if
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
the judge or magistrate is persuaded
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
that probable cause has been shown
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
basically the warrant issues and the
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
device can be lawfully imp placed and
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
tracked as things now stand every one of
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
us carries with us a GPS tracking device
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
it's called a
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
smartphone and unless we turn it off so
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
it cannot ping cell towers those who
 
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.829 align:start position:0%
it cannot ping cell towers those who
have

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
csli cell site locator information which
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
all the carriers necessarily have and
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to have can provide a map of where
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
we get go and it's a fairly precise map
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
not down to the nearest Foot but if a
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
crime were committed uh it would tell
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that we were pretty
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
close to where that crime was committed
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
so in short the data that this bill
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
would protect by requiring law
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to get a warrant in order to
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
access the data is simply
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
vital and there should really not be or
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
there should not need to be discussion
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
as to the necessity of enacting this
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill if law enforcement needs a warrant
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
to imp place a GPS tracker on a vehicle
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:52.589 align:start position:0%
they should need to get a warrant to get
the

00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%

information about our smartphone usage
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's really cut and dried as the British
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
say when something is obvious it is
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%

presenting to you for your consideration
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
HB 612 FN relative to the penalty for
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
overtaking a school bus a little history
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
on how this bill came
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
about back in 2018 there were a number
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
of well publicized accidents involving
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
school buses and in 2019 house trans
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation received three different
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
bills from both sides of the aisle that
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
were filed to increase the penalty for
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
overtaking a
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
bus the bills either increased the fines
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
suspended the driver's license or were a
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
combination of both we retained the
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
bills and our full committee worked
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
together in a bipartisan collaboration
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
to review and develop one that we all
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
agreed with today's Bill House Bill 612
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
is the exact same wording as House Bill
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
626 that passed the Full House last
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
January let me walk you through the
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
statute the current fine for a
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
first-time offense is
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
$150 and this bill increases it to
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
$250 most violations are issued to
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
firsttime offenders and I imagine it's
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
often a wakeup call and a lesson learned
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the department of safety issued
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
119 citations for firsttime violations
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
and one for a subsequent off
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
in 2020 with far fewer buses on the
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
roads due to the pandemic there were
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
only 38 firsttime violations however
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
there was still one citation issued for
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
a subsequent
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
offense for subsequent offenses the
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
current statute has arranged for a fine
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
of $250 to
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 we heard testimony from the
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
Department that having a range is
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
problematic and it's preferable to have
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
one set fine we set that new fine for a
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense at $500 plus penalty
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
assessment which is not currently
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
statute regarding a suspension of
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
license we changed the word may to shall
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure an automatic loss of driving
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
privilege for 30 days again the
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
department stated a preference for
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
definitive wording as opposed to leaving
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
the suspension open as a
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
possibility the threat of an automatic
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
loss of license would hopefully be a
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
strong deterrent for the driver who
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
receives Citation for the First
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
Defense finally regarding the fiscal
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
note of
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
$155,000 I reached out to the department
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
to confirm that this is the blanket
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that they give to bills that
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
would require an update to the uniform
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
fine schedule and reprogramming of their
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
systems with the effective date of
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
January 1 it can be assumed that all
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
updates for the year would occur at once
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
and they would be able to consolidate
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
all of the changes and charges at that
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
time in conclusion HB 612 tightens up
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
the wording of the existing statute
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
while increasing the fine moderately for
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
the first offense and a mandatory 30-day
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
loss of license for repeat offenders I
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
believe these changes speak to the
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
seriousness of the violation without
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
being overly burdensome for the
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
firsttime offender who truly does make a
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
mistake in passing a school bus at the
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
same time one accident is far too many
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe the penalty needs to be
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
updated to send a strong message about
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
the safety of our children I believe
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department of
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
Safety will make themselves available
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
after my testimony but I'm happy to take
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%

directly thank you
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%

um uh cites a $500 plus penalty
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
assessment um what is a penalty
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
assessment in in terms of this
 
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
assessment in in terms of this
particular

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse um I may defer for
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
the legal uh definition to someone from
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Department safety but what I
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand is it's a um additional fine
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
that's issued it's a percentage um of
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the fine that is added on um for
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
the Violator and as you can see for the
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
first time offense in the statute it's
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
already listed there the penalty
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
assessment I believe for the secondary
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
offense it was a um an Omission um that
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
should have been included but um again I
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
would defer I think um M Britney shoot
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
from the Department of safety may be
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
willing to answer that question if she's
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%

and me to the members of the public we
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh with the exception of the
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative introduces the bill we
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
are limiting testimonies to two minutes
 
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.349 align:start position:0%
are limiting testimonies to two minutes
per

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
witness uh can you folks hear me yes we
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
can hear you uh all right I'm
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative Max Abramson I'll try to
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
keep my um statements down to two
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
minutes um I do support the bill and I I
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment uh 443 H uh which
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
would quadruple speeding fines while
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
someone is uh overtaking a a school bus
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
or passing a school bus um my reasoning
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
for supporting the bill um and and the
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
reason I submitted an amendment is the
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
fines actually seem uh pretty slight
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
this uh driving past a a school bus
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's loading and offloading children
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
and especially if people are driving at
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
very high speed which they they often
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
tend to do is that if you compare this
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
to drinking and driving this if
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
somebody's driving you know down a a
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
dark road somewhere this is many many
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
times more dangerous than drinking and
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
driving this is much more dangerous than
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh somebody shooting some fireworks off
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
into a residential neighborhood or or or
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
even firing a gun into the forest or
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
something this is this is uh uh the
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
statistics on hitting a an adult if you
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
if you're driving a car and you hit you
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
hit an adult pedestrian um their chances
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
of surviving um at 15 miles an hour at
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
the time of impact are about 85 to 90%
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
if you hit them at 25 miles per hour
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
that uh drops down to 55% and if you hit
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
them at 35 miles an hour they're
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
American and European studies that show
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
the survival rate drops down to about 10
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
or 15% and most civil engineers and and
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
safety experts uh admit that um at
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
speeds higher than that your chances of
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
of survival if you get hit at a speed
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
higher than that are are are almost none
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
so when a school bus stops it's almost
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
certain and they put the stop sign out
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's almost certain that there are going
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
to be children going across the road
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's almost a
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
certainty and so somebody speeding past
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
a bus their chances of hitting a child
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
are very very high and that child
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any realistic opportunity
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
to move out of the way the visibility
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
very ports why we have the stop sign up
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
um and there's nothing that the school
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
bus driver can do so I think that the
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary and I also think that
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment is necessary quadrupling
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
the speeding fines to deter people from
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
flying uh past at very high speeds there
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
are some people who are driving I've
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
been told 70 miles an hour but I I have
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time believing that but
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
even if somebody's doing 45 or 55 miles
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
an hour past a school bus I think that's
 
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.069 align:start position:0%
an hour past a school bus I think that's
just

00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh that's borderline felony
 
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
endangerment thank thank you
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.069 align:start position:0%
endangerment thank thank you

to how many have been
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
suspended I can definitely find that
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
you representative PR I have a question
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh how is the person caught doing
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh how is the person caught doing
this

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat your
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
question question how is how was the
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
up you know the
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
process you know who called who turns it
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
in I believe thank you for your question
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
um when a person passes a school bus I
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
believe it would be the bus driver of
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
the vehicle or any um participants
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
witnessed um anyone that's witnessed the
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
actions they contact the local police
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
department and I believe um that is how
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
handled they're required to write a
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
letter you think that's true bus driver
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
required to write a letter St they
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
saw thank you for your
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
question if Sergeant Kelby is on this he
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
may be able to speak to the process
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
required by law enforcement to take the
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate action and how the citation
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
would be issued to the individual who um
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
you if I may I believe there was a
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
question in regards to penalty
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
assessment the penalty assessment
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 106
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
L10 is it's a penalty of $2 or 24%
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
whichever is graded and is added to the
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
fine that is set in the uniform time
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:29.750 align:start position:0%
fine that is set in the uniform time
schedule

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative gather can you just
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
repeat what was said yes thank you for
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
your question the penalty assessment
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
is penalty of $2 or 24% whichever is
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
greater and it is applied to the
 
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.309 align:start position:0%
greater and it is applied to the
statutory

00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
10 thank you seeing no further hands
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
raised the witness is excused I want to
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your testimony at
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.069 align:start position:0%
 
Kelby

00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
hello

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
hello I apologize for uh I I just uh
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
I've been having some technical issues
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
with my computer and as representative
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
tersi was concluding Our Testimony I was
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
finally able to get in um to address the
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
question about um who is the complainant
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
on a violation uh for passing a school
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
bus um the school bus driver or the
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
statute actually says any witness um the
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
school bus driver would would typically
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
be the uh the complainant on on such a
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
violation of course the problem being
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the school bus driver is often uh
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
you know focused on the kids getting on
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
and off the bus um and you know dealing
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
with the kids that are on the bus so a
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
lot of times those uh complaints uh
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
can't be um prosecuted because we we
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
can't get a good statement from the
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
times

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
representative Conley you recognized
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
Sergeant um in your experience do higher
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
fines tend to lead to changes in
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
Behavior like has been suggested might
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
pass yeah yeah I I I think that's uh you
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
know I mean you know if you're asking my
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
personal experience or my uh guess I
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
should say I would say Yes um um knowing
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
that it's going to cost you x amount of
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
money if you're speeding uh in a
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
particular area is probably going to
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
make people slow down a little more
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
often um the the the the possibility of
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
a suspended license is is certainly
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
going to um you know increase
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that I call it survivability I know
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
in Maine they have criminal speed uh
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an assumption by a lot
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
of Us in New Hampshire that we have
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
criminal speed uh we don't um you know
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we have reckless driving but
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
the the knowledge that criminal speed is
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
out there and and people can be arrested
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
for you know for a particular speed
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
limit like in Maine does does affect uh
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
driving representative con you recognize
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
for a followup question thank you Mr
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and Sergeant um did I
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
understand correctly a moment ago you
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
say that um some uh likely cases of
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
passing the school bus illegally are not
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
actually prosecuted as such might
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
suggest that the number of times this
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
occurs would be more than the data uh of
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
people who are penalized for this
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
offense would
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
suggest thank you representative Kinley
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's not a guess um we do um
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
Operation Safe stop uh we didn't do it
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
last year because of coid and it's a new
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
initiative that uh School Bus industry
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
um initiated with Department of Safety
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
saus and we're reporting um you know
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
many many many times more violations of
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
passing school buses than are than are
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
prosecuted that's factual information we
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
take those stats and I apologize I don't
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
have those stats I wasn't prepared to
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
answer question like that I can
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
certainly uh look to my my Trooper
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's in charge of people
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
transportation to to obtain that
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
information but the last the year before
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
last um when we had operation saf stop
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
we had you know I think we issued maybe
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
three or four summonses throughout the
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
state um but but that was just a like a
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
tiny tiny tiny percentage of the
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
reported violations that occurred during
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
that particular day uh that that we had
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
going representative CR I have a
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
question um in my area we have a large
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
bus company we have one driver that
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
writes a letter DMV almost every month
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
about somebody passing them and then we
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
have other bus drivers that never have
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
written a letter for that violation ever
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
and they've and they've been bus drivers
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
for years you think that speaks to the
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the bus drivers in trying to
 
00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:50.150 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the bus drivers in trying to
prosecut

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
prosecut
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
say no I don't um and thank you for the
 
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.549 align:start position:0%
say no I don't um and thank you for the
question

00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
you you know uh being a cop's not easy
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
and being aware of all the laws that we
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
we have to be familiar with isn't easy
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
as well and um going to court isn't easy
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
you know we you know we we we present
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
cases often and they're thrown out um
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
but educating law
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement um as to the process under
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
26554 has always been um really hard for
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety people
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation unit um a lot of times
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
police officers are not
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
aware that the um that the uh the law
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
speaks to a school bus
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
driver um being able to be the you know
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for legal action to take
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
place now
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
consequently uh it's also imperative
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
that the complainant is able to
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
identify um the vehicle that that uh
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
passed it and again this is the problem
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know you we'll we'll we don't the uh
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
Office of Pupil Transportation does not
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
get a lot of these letters um what we
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
typically do and I've done this in the
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
past is I I I'll get a call to to my
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
trooper that runs that program and I'll
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
be filling in for whatever the case may
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
be and I'll have a bus driver I rate
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
that they had a vehicle pass them and my
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
question is have you did you get the
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
license plate well I didn't okay do you
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
have a camera on the bus well we don't
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
um okay can you describe the vehicle
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
well it was green there's there's not a
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
lot we can do with that
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um so so a lot of times
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
we'll get these complaints that
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just aren't um up to Snuff
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to do anything with
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
um but also
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh getting getting off track
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
here the getting that complaint with the
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
accurate information to the police
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
officer is is imperative but we also
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
don't enforce laws in Comm commun you
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
know these traffic laws in most
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
communities we refer these to the police
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
department we will get calls from
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
concerned bus drivers that the the local
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
police department isn't you know isn't
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
issuing a summons based on their
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
complaint we've called police officers
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know police Chiefs from the
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
community and explain to them that the
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
the driver of the school bus under
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
statutory law is essentially the
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
complainant for that uh summon uh police
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
officers are not used to that because we
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't normally um there's a most cases
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
we can't use a a complaint from a third
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
party to to prosecute so we're we have
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
it drilled in our heads that you know we
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
can't rely on on a statement without a

it after an investigation but this is
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
one that says oh by the way you don't
 
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
need it the the school bus driver is
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient so education to the police
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
department is essential um reminding
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
police officers that they have the
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
authority to do this uh continuing with

of these complaints that do go to the
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
DMV uh they don't make it to us but a
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times when they do make it to the
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
prosecute hope I hope that answered your
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that representative
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
Muse you recognized for a
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
question um uh you raised an issue that
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
I was curious about I'm wondering how
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
common uh cameras are on school buses in
 
01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:53.029 align:start position:0%
common uh cameras are on school buses in
New

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question they're not
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
statutorily mandated um and the problem
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
of course is that uh well typically the
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
cameras that are on school buses are
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
inside facing um cameras and they're
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
also owned or contracted by the SAU the
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
school bus company doesn't actually own
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
the the rights to that uh digital
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
information uh typically we'll have a uh
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
complaint of a school bus driver come in
 
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:26.839 align:start position:0%
like Behavior type issue we'll find out
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
if they have a uh a camera on board and
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
then we'll petition the school
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
department the SAU if we can gather that
 
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
information um some school some school
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
bus services uh like uh Manchester
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
Transit Authority have 365 degree
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
cameras inside and outside um making you
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
know making a um making a violation re
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
really easy for a police officer to to
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
bring forward onal half of the the
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
school bus driver but those are very
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
rare uh we we don't have a lot of
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
cameras out there um interior cameras
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
are are more common but they're not
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
required by the
 
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.390 align:start position:0%
required by the
state

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
follow represent M you were recognized
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
for a followup question so so knowing
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
that Manchester has um that type of
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
equipment already on their school buses
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
do they have a a higher rate of
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
prosecutions for this
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:25.349 align:start position:0%
prosecutions for this
offense

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
thanks for your followup question of
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
course that's one I have no idea about I
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
I could tell you the the year before
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
last um when we were doing safe stop we
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
were actually in Manchester and about an
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
hour after the um the uh the the the
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
operation started our first summons
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
issued was by Manchester uh which was
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
great um but I I I think we only had
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
like maybe three summonses issued that
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
day but one of them was man TR I think
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth was another one um I but I
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question without I
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
really don't know the answer that
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
you see see no further hands raised I
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank thank the witness for his
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
Cooper U thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
Katherine Cooper here testifying today
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill on behalf of
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers um our
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
opposition is fairly simple we believe
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
that you should leave the discretion for
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
punishment of the bulk of offenses to
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and judges so that they can
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
evaluate the facts and circumstances of
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
each case um you know I can tell you
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
quite a few stories having represented
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
people on charges like this where um it
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
would have been significantly unjust to
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
punish them um at a higher rate and to
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
have these automatic fines and license
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
suspensions in fact one of the cases
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
that I had involved an actual bus driver
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
who was charged with passing a school
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
bus um at a school because the
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
dispatcher had told her she was in her
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
personal car still go around them and go
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
move the other bus so the police officer
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
who was on site saw this car um go past
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
the school bus with the stop sign on and
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know he kind of went ballistic on
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
her and um she ended up charged by the
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
time we were able to get to court
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
everything was calmed down we explained
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
the circumstances the dispatcher
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
explained um the charge ended up being
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
placed on file without a finding because
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
the police officer was still really
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
angry and refused to let the prosecutor
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
completely drop it but you know that
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
would have been a situation where we
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
have someone who actually works there
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
fully understands what's going on and
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are actually watching the
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
safety of the children were all in the
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
loop and knew that the kids were on the
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
bus and this lady just had to go past to
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
move the other bus um anyway so that's
 
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
just one example the fact that we need
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
to give the people who are involved in
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
actual cases the ability and the
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
authority to put into place appropriate
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
sanctions um for the facts and
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances of each
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
case um I'd also like to point out the
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
fact that in the extreme cases for
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
example where someone is speeding um
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
past a school bus and really endangering
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
someone they're likely to also be
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
charged with Reckless operation or
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
another higher level driving offense so
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
um there are plenty of tools there to
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
make higher sanctions and get license
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
suspensions for people who are really uh
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
behaving in a dangerous fashion in this
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
way so um I would encourage the
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you M M Cooper for your
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair May inquire question
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
and I will thank you in advance for
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
question uh did I understand your
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly did did you testify
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
that the the district attorney or the
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
County Attorney would not drop the
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
charge because the police officer
 
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them if I heard that
 
01:09:41.239 --> 01:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them if I heard that
correctly

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
or yeah the police officer felt very
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
strongly that because the person was
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
technically guilty of that charge they
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want it to just be dropped so it
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
ended up being placed on file without a
 
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.229 align:start position:0%
ended up being placed on file without a
f

01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative B you recognize
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony uh so from what I'm
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
hearing is because I see in the bill on
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
line six it says that the director shall
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
if this passes before current law is
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
made so if I'm hearing you correctly you
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
believe that the May should stand so
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
that way the judge has discretion on yes
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
this is a bad person that was a dummy
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
that passed a bus or this was an honest
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
mistake is that what I'm hearing it
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
exactly representative B that's exactly
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
our position you should keep this keep
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
the discretion with the prosecutor to
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
request it and the judge to um put a
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
suspension in place if it is indeed
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate in any given
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
second just just for the members that
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
are participating remotely before
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to house
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
rules a member has to be in their seat
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
when a matter is put the question once
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the question is put if you're not in
 
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
the question is put if you're not in
your

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
seat you're not ask the rules don't
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
permit that member to return to the seat
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's also the reverse if you're in your
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
seat the members not actually committed
 
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.390 align:start position:0%
seat the members not actually committed
to

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
leave ordinary circumstances this is a
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
very clear rule when we're all sitting
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
in the room together however when
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
members are participating remotely
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
it can be a little more
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
chall but the members that are not
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
physically in the room I will say that
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
every time
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
I remove the
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
question I always say seeing no fur the
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
then matter the
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
question if you're not if your camera is
 
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.510 align:start position:0%
question if you're not if your camera is
not

01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
on going forward the chair is not going
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
to consider that member be in their
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
seat I would say for the members
 
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.229 align:start position:0%
seat I would say for the members
participating

01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
participating
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
remotely it is a good practice leave
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
your camera on during the exec
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
session uh I I don't I don't see that
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
being a very difficult T to a rule to
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
comply with so I would ask that all
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
members I do do my best to make sure
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are members moving around in the
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
physical room I'm sure the
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative from do knows that I try
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
to accommodate people schedule
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
I don't try to take advantage of the
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
fact that someone's simply standing you
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
know for a minute and then try to rule
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
them not in their seat but at the same
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
time we do need to keep things moving
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
and if we're all going to participate in
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
the executive
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
session I would assume that if if the
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
members engaged that that camera would
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
be on and I believe that's also just
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
from a fairness perspective it's for the
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
members of the public it's it's
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
appreciated so representative bden I see
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the cameras on on I am we're about to
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
move the question but I would I would
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
ask all members have their cameras on if
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not on although that member's
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
name will be called their vote will not
 
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.430 align:start position:0%
name will be called their vote will not
be

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
yes but it would be good practice to
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
Simply leave the I would recommend the
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
members leave the cameras on so there's
 
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.070 align:start position:0%
members leave the cameras on so there's
no

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.950 align:start position:0%
 
misunderstanding

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
raised the matter will now be put
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
question if you in favor of the motion
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%

179 thank
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
you I'll start with House Bill
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
347 this bill was filed last year and I
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
believe it passed manly in
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
transportation and however it was either
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
tabled or did not make it out of the
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
Senate due to the co 19
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic what this what this bill would
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
essentially do if someone is convicted
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
of driving with a suspended license what
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
would happen is the for the purposes of
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
considering whether it's a subsequent
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
offense the in the state of New
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they only consider the a
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
conviction previously in New
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when this when this issue was
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention the majority
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of Motor Vehicle
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
infractions or Motor Vehicle Laws
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
whether they're infractions or amount to
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
a criminal
 
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
offense they take into
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
consideration reasonably equivalent
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
offenses and other jurisdictions very
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
common with drunk driving
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
convictions whether it's offensive with
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
speeding or whatnot this seemed to be
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
the only offense that we could that was
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
on the on record that did not take into
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
consideration an out of state conviction
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
so what this would do it was believ that
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
this was more oversight when the law was
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh passed as opposed to anything else so
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
this was intended specifically
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
to uh make this consistent with the
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:10.730 align:start position:0%
laws then in respect to House Bill
 
01:32:10.730 --> 01:32:14.510 align:start position:0%
laws then in respect to House Bill
[Applause]

01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
involves offering you know a negligent
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
homicide and it references RSA 630 col 3
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
an aggravated or an aggravated Defence
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
while driving well
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
intoxicated basically this involves a
 
01:32:30.119 --> 01:32:32.229 align:start position:0%
intoxicated basically this involves a
vehicular

01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
vehicular
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
homicide what it would do is that it
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
would right now A A it would be
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
considered class a felony but it's
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
also the penalty is basically seven
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
years it can be increase depending on
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
some other circumstances but what this
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
would do it would added to a minimum
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
sentence of 10 years as opposed to right
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
now with with the lighter sentence for
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
it also takes in consideration if the
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide was a result of a
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
driver who had prior convictions of
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
drunk driving and it takes into
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
consideration whether they had one
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
previous conviction or they had two
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
prior convictions I will say that drunk
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
driving is a problem in all 50 states
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
and it can continues to be a problem
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just operating under the
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
influence of alcohol it's also operating
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
under the influence of any drugs or
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
substance that would impair one's
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
drive it's something that it's a hazard
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's throughout the state that
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that and I would say that someone who's
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
committed this
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
offense and then is already been
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
convicted of it and then to commit the
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
offense again resulting in in a
 
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
homicide uh is a terrible tragedy that
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
could be avoided but
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh this this is intended
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
to really raise raise the the offense uh
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
this bill was actually filed last term
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh it was uh Senate Bill
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
743 uh was filed by Senator felus uh it
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
did pass in the Senate however it was
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
tabled as a result of the co 19
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh this was a bill that I uh
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
came across really by by Fate just due
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the title in did because it had a
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
similar title to a bill that was in our
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
committee last year even though the two
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
bills were very
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
different I but I signed in support of
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
the bill and I supported the concept and
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
I I certainly supported what uh the
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
motivation behind this bill uh the bill
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
is drafted uh which that was Senate Bill
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
743 would had a title called naming it
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
Tyler Shaw's law I did not include that
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
name in the this bill but I there is an
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that is proposed that that has
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
been prepared that would add that and
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
sadly Mr sh was killed by a drunk driver
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
on April 30th of
 
01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.669 align:start position:0%
on April 30th of
2018

01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
and Tyler was driving on a logging Hill
 
01:35:10.199 --> 01:35:11.550 align:start position:0%
and Tyler was driving on a logging Hill
Road

01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
Road
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
in and at the end of the ex a drunk
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
driver blew through a stops line at 60
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and subsequently hit
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
and caused the caus him to pass away
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
from from the accident uh the driver of
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
that vehicle had two prior uh DUI
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
convictions UL uh they were 11 years
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
apart but the driver did have two
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
convictions the perpetrator got a
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
sentence of six to 12
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
years it was my opinion just and I sat
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
and listened to the testimony uh from
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
the senator last year when the bill was
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
introduced in the Senate and uh I agreed
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it really did show a gap in the law
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we would need some enhancement in
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
the sentences regarding aggravated DUIs
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
or negligent
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
homicide uh for someone who is arrested
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
and convicted of having a DUI as part of
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
the U often the if they are convicted
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
the post trial probation there's often
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
educational classes and awareness that
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
person would go through although it's
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
it's presumed that someone anyone who's
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
licensed to drive knows the risk and
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
dangers of uh drunk driving or driving
 
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.590 align:start position:0%
dangers of uh drunk driving or driving
while

01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
impaired uh someone who's been already
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
convicted of a of this offense has been
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
re-educated on that so it would be uh in
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion less acceptable for this to
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
time so there's different circumstances
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
that can that can invoke an elevated
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
offense uh one of them would be the
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
blood alcohol content being double the
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
legal limit uh so right now it's
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
08 uh so if you your blood alcohol
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
content was 0.16 at the time of the
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
accident that would be an uh a fence
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
that can make it an aggravated
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
offence I will say that uh this is this
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
is a bill that's intended to not only
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
raise awareness but it's also intended
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
to try to deter the activity of driving
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
um under the influence of alcohol and I
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
think it's particularly important to
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
deter repeat offenders because uh any
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
anytime someone gets behind the wheel
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
while impaired they run the risk of uh
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
causing harm to someone in this in this
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
way and it's always a dangerous act so I
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
would hope that this bill is considered
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh given consideration and it's t the
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
pass I will yield any questions for when
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
then

01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
there Mr chairman I just asked her to
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
morning good morning would you uh let us
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
know which bill you are addressing
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether I'm addressing Bill
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
179 thank you
 
01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:25.070 align:start position:0%
179 thank you
make

01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Beth Shaw and I
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
support Bill
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
179 which would also be known as Tyler
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
Shaw's law Tyler Shaw is my
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
son Tyler was only 20 years old when he
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
was killed by a drunk driver in
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
2018 sadly the tragic crash that killed
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
my son would Mark the third DUI
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
conviction of the man that killed
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
him I ask each of you to to consider
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
this question if your son daughter
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
spouse or parent were senselessly
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
brutally murdered by a person whose
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
driving record is littered with drunk
 
01:39:04.599 --> 01:39:05.589 align:start position:0%
driving record is littered with drunk
driving

01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
convictions would you feel six years in
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
prison is an adequate penalty for the
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
one it is important for you to know the
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
history of the drunk driver Joseph
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
Leonard Jr that killed Tyler it is the
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
backbone of this
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Leonard's first DUI conviction
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
was at the age of
 
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
17 his second DUI conviction involved a
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
single car accident with a blood alcohol
 
01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
single car accident with a blood alcohol
of

01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
0.24 along with an admission that he
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
took countless prescription pills before
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
getting behind the
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
wheel he was sentenced to 12 months in
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
prison all of which was suspended by a
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
judge he was also required to have an
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
interlock installed in his
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
car five months after his interlock was
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
installed he blew a 0.16 into his
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
Interlock in November of
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
2017 his interlock was removed from his
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle a mere six months after his
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
interlock was removed he killed my
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
son Mr Leonard was not coming home from
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
a bar the night he killed Tyler he was
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
coming directly from
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
work he worked in Lebanon and he lived
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
in Dairy he knew he had a two-hour Drive
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
ahead of him yet he chose to drink
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
enough during his workday to put his
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
blood alcohol at 016 at the time of the
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
crash his history of drinking and
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
driving endangering countless lives of
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents is
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
horrifying what I find equally
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
horrifying is the Miss opportunities by
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire courts to hold Mr
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
Leonard accountable for his drunk
 
01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.750 align:start position:0%
Leonard accountable for his drunk
driving

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
convictions after all the goal of
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
sentencing is to send a clear message of
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
deterrence and
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation however when New
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts allow a defense lawyer
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
to successfully plead down the charges
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
to a slap on the wrist that opportunity
 
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.589 align:start position:0%
to a slap on the wrist that opportunity
is

01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
lost I will always wonder if Mr Leonard
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
had served some time anytime from his
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
second conv ition would it have changed
 
01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.790 align:start position:0%
second conv ition would it have changed
his

01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
behavior more importantly for me would
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
my son be alive
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
today to reinforce the fact that current
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide penalties are
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate is to compare them to other
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
penalties of crimes none of which
 
01:41:43.709 --> 01:41:43.719 align:start position:0%
resulted in death in 2019 and 2020 the
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
following sentences were handed down in
 
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
courtrooms a molten Boro man was
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
sentenced to 15 to 30 years for
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%

01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%

than that of negligent
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
homicide there has been some criticism
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill that an enhanced sentence
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
is not going to deter people from from
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
driving drunk or solve the underlying
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
problem that is not the purpose of Bill
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
179 the purpose is to adequately and
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately sentence habitual

victim a drunk driver with multiple
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
convictions deserves the enhancements
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
articulated in this
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
bill as a mother who has made her way

through the criminal justice system
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
because a young s son was killed by a
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
drunk driver I am urging you to support
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
this bill help protect New Hampshire
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
residents and honor those lives that
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
were senselessly taken by a drunk
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
driver as a state New Hampshire needs to
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
step up and strengthen the drunk driving
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
laws too many innocent victims are dying
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
roads you won't see change unless you
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
make change and if this bill could save
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%

M there no questions from the
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee we will

minute testimony and be helpful if you
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh State up front which bill you are
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
addressing and whether you support or
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
oppose make
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Contin who does she represent I think
 
01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.189 align:start position:0%
Contin who does she represent I think
she's

01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
she's
 
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'm with the Department of Safety
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles and we are
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
neutral on this I am here um as if any
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
questions had come up if I could
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
347
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
question has a question thank you for
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question and being here for
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
that question um the last speaker of
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
that lost her son
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
said that the person
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
that had the inter I'm not sure what it
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
is it's a system in your
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
truck it blew he got into the truck to
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
1.6 I'm assuming the
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
system you know the whole system you
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
know our court system and everything
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
else failed us at that point um could
 
01:45:47.599 --> 01:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
else failed us at that point um could
you

01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
explain normally what happens and why it
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
didn't happen in this case that he blew
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
a 1.6 and didn't show up at his door
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
yard in like three seconds to say what's
 
01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
yard in like three seconds to say what's
going

01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
on thank you for your question an
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock device is a device in
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
which an individual would provide a
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
breast sample there
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
at the set point the vehicle should not
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
start um I'm not quite sure if Miss Shaw
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
had articulated that the device was
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
removed um prior to to that accident
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
with the 0.16 so therefore there
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been a device in the
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle to prevent the vehicle from
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
being started but what a device is
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to do is prohibit the start of
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
a vehicle when the breath alcohol
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
content has reached the set
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
point all right thank you and Mr
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
chairman a followup yes follow up and
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
and well thank you for taking my second
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
question so how she did mention that you
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
know five months later I believe it was
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
that she said that U it was
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
removed how would that happen if you
 
01:46:59.709 --> 01:46:59.719 align:start position:0%
blow a
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
1.6 that in you're trying to drive I'm
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
assuming somebody's
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
notified um how would that interlocked
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
system be removed five months later with
 
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:12.679 align:start position:0%
that behavior you know where did the
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
system go wrong so we could try to fix
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
it other than just this Bill thank you
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
for your follow-up question if the
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
device was removed from the vehicle it
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
would have been that the individual
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
required to have it has met their
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
retention period for that um if they
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
12-month requirement they can have a
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
six- month requirement the requirement
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
can be extended due to multiple
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
violations if Mr Leonard had met the
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
point to which he um the that 12 months
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll say for an instance in this
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
conversation that he was required to
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
have for 12 months on the day after the
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
12th month he would request for Motor
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
Vehicles a review of the record and if
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that is egregious or any
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
item there that would keep the device in
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
the vehicle which would ultimately be
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
referred to the Bureau of hearings to
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a hearing with that individual then
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
the device is removed from the
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle all right I understand now thank
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
you for helping me with that
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely is there any other question
 
01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:15.470 align:start position:0%
from the committee I
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:18.390 align:start position:0%
from the committee I
[Music]

01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
question yes Mr chairman thank thank you
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question and
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
this is just more of a clarification on
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
what you just told representative Bert
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
so you have an interlock device and five
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
months prior the person blew a a value
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
that would exceed the law to start the
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
vehicle and the vehicle didn't start
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
when they reach the time limit on the
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
interlock device is that record of of um
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
each um event where they blew into the
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
inter device is that recorded in
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed or when you said that they
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
review the record they review the uh
 
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
violation record thank you for your
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
question when an individual ref device
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
removed from their vehicle the ignition
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
interlock coordinator does a review of
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
the violation logs all the violation
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
logs are kept by the provider so there's
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring and there's violations if
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's violations that are consistent
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
with referring the individual to a
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the then those uh violation are
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the New Hampshire hearings
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau who then conducts um a hearing
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
with the defendant to determine whether
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
the device needs to stay in the vehicle
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
and be extended I hope that answered
 
01:49:30.239 --> 01:49:31.430 align:start position:0%
and be extended I hope that answered
your

01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%

that you said that the uh what was
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed I guess more
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
specifically if if in fact that 1.6 was
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the device would the person person
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
have reviewed the information on the
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
device and would a VI uh an amount
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
greater than the than
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
point8 um be a reason for them not to
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
remove the device thank you for your
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
question when the ignition interlock
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator reviews the reports of the
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock device uh 08

violations are sent to hearings for
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%

uh system the Ignition Interlock system
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
has been one designed for drugs yet or
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
just alcohol thank you for your

questions currently the ignition
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
interlock device is for the breath
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol content and would serve for
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol thank

01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
am happy to answer any questions and
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
while miss Sho was testifying I did look
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
into some of our hearing records
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
pertaining to that individual Mr
 
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.430 align:start position:0%
pertaining to that individual Mr
Leonard

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh questions by the
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chairman what what record
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
did he look
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
up you know the DWI case yeah the one
 
01:53:04.639 --> 01:53:06.830 align:start position:0%
up you know the DWI case yeah the one
that

01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I looked up our hearing records
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
for interlock extension and I do have a
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
hearing report in front of me for what
 
01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
hearing report in front of me for what
looks

01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
like a violation hearing that we held
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
based on a
 
01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.910 align:start position:0%
based on a
0.65

01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
0.65
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
BAC that had occurred on September 23rd
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
2016 so I believe that may have been the
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
incident that mhaw was referring to so I
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you what the department did in
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
case I would have a question repres a
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for looking that up because I
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just at a loss of why this
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
happened so if you wouldn't mind
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
explaining why he was allowed to blow a
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
1.65 and then 5 months
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
later have his Interlock system removed
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle yeah looking at we held a
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
hearing on November 10th 2016 for an
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
interlock extension because if someone
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
is not able to start their car based on
 
01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
an elevated BAC the report goes from the
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
interlock provider to the Department of
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles who then forwards it to
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
us I'm the person generally who reviews
 
01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
the violation reports and recommends
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
what to be scheduled for hearings so
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
this document was reviewed it was
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
recommended hearing that was held on
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
November 10th
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
2016 and there was an order extending
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
the interlock device based on that
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
0.165 it was for a per period of six
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
months I mean in retrospect we can look
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
at was a six-month suspension long
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
enough in retrospect it probably was not
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
but that was the action that the
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
department took a hearings examiner did
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
look at it and did extend the device six
 
01:55:08.079 --> 01:55:10.069 align:start position:0%
look at it and did extend the device six
extra

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
months in a followup Mr chairman yes
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
have a follow thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
from what I understand uh and please
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
correct me if I misunderstood it was
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
removed five months later you know how
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
happen well I would have to look at when
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
the removal date was but according to
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
this I'm looking at the hearing
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
report and it was
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:43.719 align:start position:0%
months so that would put it into July
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
extension any further questions for the
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative nman has a
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the six-month
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
limitation on the extension of an
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
interlock device is that a rule or is
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
that an RSA that that uh is that a
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
maximum limit or is it something else no
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
no for each and that is that is a lesser
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
for each extension it could be up to a
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
year extension so that's why I say in
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
retrospect extending it for six
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
months if we had it to do over again
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we would do it differently but it
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
it can be up to a year so the hearings
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
examiner could do it up to a year for
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
each test over the 0.025
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
BAC thank you very much you're
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee have a question thank you Mr
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for prot my
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
question um so it it's clear that uh
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
there are people that drive intoxicated
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh real issues with alcohol uh what
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
recourses do does the department have in
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
order to try to
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
rectify uh Behavior such
 
01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you representative
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
bour I think the intellect program
 
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
the extension for violations can occur
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain types of behaviors
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
that can result in license suspension so
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
an example for a repeat offender that
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
can be utilized is if someone keeps
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
coming up to us for hearings because
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
they keep testing over the car doesn't
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
start we schedule them we look at the
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
history we can suspend the license for a
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
pattern of interlock failures in terms
 
01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
of what a pattern is is that's really
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
not defined in the statute but to me
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
more than probably three is a pattern so
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
generally if I see 34 five prior
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
hearings for interlock extensions due to
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
test over or some other type of
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
violation I will also schedule it not
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
only for a violation to see if the
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
device should be extended but but for a
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
hearing to see if the license should be
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
suspended based on a pattern of failures
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
although kind of at the beginning of
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
this program one case that we saw we
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
kept seeing repeated failures for this
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
man and eventually his license was
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
suspended the interlock was removed
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't supposed to be driving
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
he got in a car without an interlock
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
device got charged with a DUI luckily he
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
didn't hurt anyone but he called our
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
office complaining about that we
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
suspended him the interlock got taken
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
out and he he was blaming us for his
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
getting a duy saying if you didn't
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
suspend my license I would have still
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
had an interlock I wouldn't have gotten
 
01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.189 align:start position:0%
had an interlock I wouldn't have gotten
the

01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
duy which I thought was was kind of an
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
interesting set of set of facts that
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
happened in that particular
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
case another
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
question uh yes um
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the only actions we can
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
have are uh uh increasing the uh uh use
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the internal o device
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh is there no way we can uh have this
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
issue of alcoholism addressed by the
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
individual rather than just uh extending
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
the the amount of time he his license
 
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.149 align:start position:0%
the the amount of time he his license
has

01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
suspended I that's certainly a good
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
point representative bour because if you
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't address the underlying alcohol
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
issue although I think in terms of the
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
statutes the statutes would say the
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of completing the impaired
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
driver Care Management program before
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
license restoration addresses the the
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol issues although once someone has
 
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
completed that program and completed all
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
the Aftercare and then they get their
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
licenses back they're beyond mandatory
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
counseling although I think your point
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
is well taken is what can we do in the
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
law after someone leaves the idcm pro
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
idcmp program successfully in order to
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
address preventing future alcohol abuse
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
and I that's a good question I think
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
maybe it's one we continue to need to
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
work on to
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
much question thank you Mr chair my
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
question is very similar to the previous
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
one but uh I have a a few other things
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
that repres presid Gord did not uh ask
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
my question really it does center around
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
um cannot we at at some
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
point force a person to go through
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
treatment for their
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
addiction as part of the the program but
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh tied into that we have with the
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
opioid addiction seen a lot of um
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
driving well impaired that takes place
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh due to drugs that are not uh not
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol in major and I don't understand
 
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
how an interlock could work for somebody
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
who had habitually driven and been
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
charged with a DUI for heroin or another
 
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
substance and we do try to provide
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
support and treatment programs for those
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
who are addicted by other drugs but it
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like we're doing the same
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
for those who are addicted to alcohol
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm asking where does the the
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh Department stand on on those issues
 
02:01:53.069 --> 02:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
and what happens specifically with
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
interlock devices that wouldn't work
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
because the person's on a substance
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol that's a question representative
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
Spain and that's what I hear from people
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
at some of these interlock hearings that
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
were not convicted of a DUI alcohol they
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
were convicted of a DUI drug and that's
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
what they will tell us they say it my
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
issue didn't involve alcohol so this
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
interlock is not helpful for me for for
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
my case I'm not sure if the intellect
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
technology can ever advance to address
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
the drug cases or not if there's
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
scientifically I just don't know what
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
the answer is to that whether breath
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
whether drug impairment can ever be
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
detected in breath or whether there's
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
some type of an equivalent device that
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
could detect drugs or
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
not so I think at this point that that
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
question is is not able able to be
 
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
answered adequately although I think
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
treatment would would be the answer for
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
those individuals rather than an
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
interlock device followup further
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
question follow up y thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
I have a followup in that
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
um my my question now is um based on on
 
02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
the extent of the epidemic with the
 
02:03:14.669 --> 02:03:14.679 align:start position:0%
opioid situation here in New Hampshire
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
and and we are one of the the hot spots
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
in the country and has been have you
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
seen data that shows that more of our
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
DUIs percentage wise are uh by those
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
people not abusing alcohol but abusing
 
02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
people not abusing alcohol but abusing
other

02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
substances and should we not start to
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
focus on addressing the broader scheme
 
02:03:33.079 --> 02:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
focus on addressing the broader scheme
of

02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
things yes that's that's a point well
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
taken I'm not aware of what the
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
statistics are in terms of the breakdown
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
between DUI alcohol or DUI drug
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
convictions and I'm not sure what the
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
court statistics would be if someone's
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
convicted of DUI impairment if it splits
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
out in the complaint whether it's drugs
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
or alcohol I in the body of the
 
02:04:00.669 --> 02:04:00.679 align:start position:0%
complaint it would but I'm just not sure
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
what statistics the court has on on that
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
distinction between drug conviction DUI
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:19.629 align:start position:0%
 
alcohola

02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
alcohola
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh so um I'm wondering uh how aware
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
are drivers of what the penalties for uh
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh DUI are at the moment and whether uh
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
so would someone know that at the moment
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh the um panel potential jail time for
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
prison time for a uh negligent homicide
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
in with the DUI was 6 to 12 and would
 
02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
they be aware that it got increased to
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
10 to
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
20 yeah I'm not sure I think it would
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
depend on the individual although I
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
think there is a lot of public education
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of drunk driving and I
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
think the general public knows that if
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're driving drunk you you'll suffer a
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
penalty and you you should suffer a
 
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
severe penalty but it's hard to say if
 
02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
they really know about the prison terms
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
and the extended term of imprison
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
prisonment as opposed to what's
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
currently available under
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
you I see other questions Mr chair
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative true oh represent true
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr CCO for taking my question um uh
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's good to hear your voice again you
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
trans you uh you testifying
 
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation a lot the last couple of
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
here I know there's a division between
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
the penalty
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
DMV assesses I'm just trying to clear it
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
My Mind One More Time DMV is like a
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
civil case you you you could lose your
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
license from DMV or you could lose your
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
license at the same time being uh in a
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
criminal court for for negligent
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
homicide or other due to DWI there's two
 
02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.470 align:start position:0%
homicide or other due to DWI there's two
separate

02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
separate
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
um punishments going on could be going
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
on at the same time is that correct it
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
could be DMV losing license and criminal
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
losing uh
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
Freedom yes that's correct and in the
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide case scenario
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
typically there would be a court
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
suspension for someone convicted of
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide and usually that same
 
02:06:48.549 --> 02:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
case will go through an admin
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing for a license
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
suspension up to seven years for
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
involvement in a fatal motor vehicle
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
crash so those those are separate and
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
someone who is suspended through our
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
administrative process based on a fatal
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle crash has to have a second
 
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
hearing to be eligible to be restored so
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
they would serve the time it could be up
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
to seven years but it will be forever
 
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
until they come back for another hearing
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
and we review certain criteria make sure
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
certain things were satisfied even above
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
and beyond what the court may require if
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
alcohol was involved generally there
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be a ladak licensed alcohol and
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
drug abuse counselor evaluation is part
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
of our license reinstatement procedure
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
at the department of
 
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
safety thank you very much you're
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
welcome I see there are no other members
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
so representative clim you have ask
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
questions you may ask them thank you Mr
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
chair I did have another question that
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
just came up based on representative
 
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.830 align:start position:0%
just came up based on representative
tr's

02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
tr's
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
question is the suspension of
 
02:08:02.669 --> 02:08:02.679 align:start position:0%
license done concurrently or
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
consecutively to jail time because it
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that suspending a
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
license with someone serving their jail
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
time is really very helpful and I would
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
hope that if they get a seven-year
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
sentence in jail for manslaughter that
 
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
the seven-year license suion takes place
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
after they get out
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just not aware of how that's
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
done that's a good question I think it's
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
up to the how the court imposes the
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
sentence it is a sentence I've seen that
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
would commence the license suspension
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
after release from
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration the same thing I think we
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
can word our hearing orders in the same
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
fashion and I know there was legislation
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
I remember a bill many years ago now
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
that I believe representative Smith
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
introduced to make that mandatory to to
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
have all the license suspensions
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
commence after release from
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
incarceration my memory of that bill
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
though is that it it did not pass and
 
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
was kind of left up to the sentencing
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
sentencing I see no other hands up thank
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the opportunity I heard
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
you all speak about um a drug and
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol program um and whether that's
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
addressed and in our case Mr Leonard had
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
successfully completed two drug and
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol programs prior to killing my
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
son um in his sentence he did or the
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
judge did award six months off of his
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
prison sentence if he successfully
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
completed another drug and alcohol
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
program which we have since been
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
notified that he has completed and he
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
has been awarded six months off of the
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
sentence for completing that program for
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
a third
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
time and also as far as license
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
suspension in our cas case um his
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
license was suspended for 10 years and
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
during his six-year prison sentence
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
those six years will count towards his
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
10-year license suspension which is
 
02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:32.950 align:start position:0%
10-year license suspension which is
another

02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
failure of this process if he's
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and he cannot drive that
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
time should come after the fact of his
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
prison sentence being completed and
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's another huge failure when whether
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's the state the courts or
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
DMV but that I believe I believe needs
 
02:10:56.830 --> 02:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
hands John is anyone else uh Mr chairman
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
I do not see anybody with their hands up
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
or tell then we will close the hearing
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we we do have uh Katherine
 
02:11:31.709 --> 02:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
Cooper listed on the testimony list and
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
I do see her with her hand
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
raised yeah I didn't see that before
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
then it was not
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
there would you like me to allow that Mr
 
02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:41.650 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah M
 
02:11:41.650 --> 02:11:45.510 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah M
[Music]

02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
Cooper um thank you representative Walsh
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um this is
 
02:11:51.149 --> 02:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
Katherine Cooper here on behalf of the
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
02:11:55.390 --> 02:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers um we oppose both of
 
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
these V both of these bills um for
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
several reasons and I would like to
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
start by saying that I am so incredibly
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
sorry for the loss of um that young man
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
and I completely understand the
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
frustration and um just ongoing sadness
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
that that family is facing um because
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
there is no way to make these systems
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
perfect and um I know that's no
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
consolation but it is unfortunately the
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
reality um we do have issues with um HB
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
179 because this does create a major
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
escalation in the penalty for Fel um
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
aggravated driving and um I would note
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that these are for um firsttime
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.549 align:start position:0%
that these are for um firsttime
offenses

02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:50.599 align:start position:0%
there's also and I'm just being brief
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
here I did submit written testimony and
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
I would please ask you to refer to that
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
because there's a great more amount of
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
detail here and I'm trying to be quick
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
because I understand the time pressures
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
um but the language in this bill is
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
really confusing it looks like there is
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
a mandatory minimum trying to create be
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
created but then it says um the court
 
02:13:10.639 --> 02:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
created but then it says um the court
can

02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
consider so if both of these amendments
 
02:13:17.549 --> 02:13:17.559 align:start position:0%
are passed the maximum penalty for the
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
enhan offense will actually be less than
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
for the Baseline offense a 10 to 30 for
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
neg hom um or felony egg DUI with
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
serious bodly injury would be 10 to 30
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
but if you have one prior DWI it would
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
be 10 to 20 so there are some there are
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
some significant drafting problems here
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
for people who actually have to apply
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the statute and use it on a day-to-day
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
basis um also with regard to I'll move
 
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
on to House Bill
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
347 um um the fir and this is for the uh
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
operating after suspension
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
charges so the first part of this bill
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
essentially elevates kind of a garden
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
variety violation level operating after
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
suspense or operate operating after
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
suspension um from a violation to a
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and there were some
 
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions earlier about people
 
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
understanding penalties for the various
 
02:14:16.030 --> 02:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
driving offenses and I can tell you in
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
no uncertain terms that 9 9% of people
 
02:14:21.310 --> 02:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
who have sat in my office over the years
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
and the offices of my colleagues have
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no clue the penalties um that
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
they are facing from the violations and
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
crimes that they have committed while
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
driving it it's it's a complex system
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
even when you work in and work in it day
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
in day out and the average citizen has
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
really no clue so there's a great deal
 
02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
of there are huge problems with relying
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
on things as deterrents um in this area
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
law um
 
02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
law um
also

02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
also
the

02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:55.170 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:56.830 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:59.069 --> 02:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
um there's a problem with this because
 
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually an unnecessary elevation
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
and if what we're really after is trying
 
02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
to keep people who have convictions and
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
priors um in line and punish more
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
severely this already will happen
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
because if a person has an
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
administrative suspension and a
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
conviction for DUI they're already
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
subject to the 7-Day mandatory minimum
 
02:15:25.229 --> 02:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
jail sentence for DWI suspensions so and
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
also if the OAS is based on reckless op
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
they already are subject to a class A
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for operating under
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
suspension um finally just real quick
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the second part of this bill extends the
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
7-Day mandatory minimum jail sentence
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
for operating after suspension um to out
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
of state DUI convictions and I just want
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
to point out that it might seem
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable to to have a prior conviction
 
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
from another state used as an
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
enhancement for this but you need to
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand and be ready to devote a lot
 
02:15:59.310 --> 02:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
of money and a lot of time if you're
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to if you're going to make this a
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
crime and look for it to be enforced um
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
you have to get out of state records
 
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
certified the prosecutors and defense
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys are going to have to spend a
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
lot of time researching um outof state
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
laws and old case facts and of course
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know this is going to result in the
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
courts having to have more hearings and
 
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
trials because this is the kind of
 
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
charge that people will fight when
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to jail mandatory minimum
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
for seven days this is one of those
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
charges where judges don't even usually
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
want to give people a s-day jail
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
sentence so there's really no penalty
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
for going to trial you're you're likely
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
you're never going to beat the offer so
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
um we would request that both of these
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
bills be voted in expedient to
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislate thank
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
you co I have a question and and it's
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
related to something that you said said
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
how necessary is it for drivers to know
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the consequences of their
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
driving I think anybody would know you
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
can't drive drunk you shouldn't what why
 
02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.190 align:start position:0%
can't drive drunk you shouldn't what why
that

02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
statement um I I I I agree with you
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Welsh that
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
people know when they're sober that they
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't drive drunk part of the
 
02:17:14.589 --> 02:17:14.599 align:start position:0%
inherent problem with with drunk driving
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
offenses is that the reason we don't
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
want people driving being drunk is
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
because their judgment is impaired and
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
they make stupid decisions and one of
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
them is getting behind the wheel so it's
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a really tricky area of law when
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
you're trying to control people's
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
behavior and the people you're trying to
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
control are inherently being irrational
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
and exercising poor
 
02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:38.910 align:start position:0%
and exercising poor
judgment

02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
so that that's one of the the really
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
difficult parts of this and it's you
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
know we have made a lot of progress in
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
this country on discouraging drunk
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
driving and and trying to create a
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
cultural shift with using Designated
 
02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
Drivers and and making people think
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
about their drinking before they have
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
drinks and get behind the wheel um and I
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
I think in day-to-day life a lot of
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
progress has been made but there's
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
always going to be people that just
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
don't respond to those kind that kind of
 
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
social messaging and um you know
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
especially when there're people with
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
severe alcohol problems
 
02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
PR I have a question uh it goes
 
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
basically to the same question Mr Welch
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
asked representative Welch um don't you
 
02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
believe that after the first person is
 
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
sentenced to a STP or jail sentence for
 
02:18:31.629 --> 02:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
killing somebody in a motor vehicle
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
accident that the wood would spread you
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't think that uh the public would
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
realize after the first person was
 
02:18:40.349 --> 02:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
sentenc to jail for a longer sentence
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
that people would find out about that
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
that they would talk about it in the
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
bars talk about it in their
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
homes you don't think the would
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
sprad um with all due respect there's
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
actually studies that show that that
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
does not happen that the deterrence of
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
individual cases does not spread um and
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
in fact it's you know it's kind of
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
interesting a lot of times um my
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
practice over the years was based
 
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
primarily in the Sea Coast area of New
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in Southern New Hampshire
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
and we would have people come in and
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
complain about how um weak the
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
sentencing laws are and when you
 
02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
actually question people further it's
 
02:19:23.469 --> 02:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
because they were watching Massachusetts
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
television they didn't even recognize
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
that the laws they were discussing were
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
not the laws of our state and were
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
repeatedly shocked to find out the New
 
02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's laws were actually
 
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's laws were actually
significantly

02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
harsher so um you know it's when you do
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
dedicated public education programs I do
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
believe that it makes a big difference
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
but I don't see a lot of impact from
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
Individual cases over the years um even
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
when they are reported in the paper and
 
02:20:01.469 --> 02:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
not has a
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr Cooper for taking the question
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
coming from a different perspective then
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement one which I sort of
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
brought up the same
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
question how
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
how many of the uh the problems that
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing with DUI these days
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
are attributable to alcohol and how many
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
to other substances and do you feel that
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of the problems could be and
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
should be addressed by confronting the
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
underlying problem of addiction through
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory treatment programs uh as part
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
sentencing um thank you for your
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
question representative Spain um I 100%
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
believe that our state should spend a
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
lot more money on substance abuse
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
treatment um in general and for driving
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a dir of of places for
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
people to go and get help um we do have
 
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
Federal funding available and we some in
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
some parts of the state they don't even
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
have places to send the money to um
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the structure set
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
up to give people the help that they
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
need on the ground I I think that's a I
 
02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
problem I see no other hands
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
up much for your Tes oh hang on
 
02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.349 align:start position:0%
up much for your Tes oh hang on
representative

02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
question um what what is your opinion
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
about uh including in in the way the law
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
is being amended aggravated DWI in with
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide and and Ne and Murder
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
By DWI however that is do you think that
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
not um for I I'm sorry
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
what which section are you referring
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
to appreciate the
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
question yes we're we're it it
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
constantly refers to murder um negligent
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
um homicide
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
and I I think that including aggravated
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
DWI in with those two
 
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
crimes as I see it in the bill that
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
whether that's appropriate or not based
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
on the seriousness of the crimes and the
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
seriousness of
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
penalties um no we we would be opposed
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
to that um and the reason being those
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
are those are first offenses and what by
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
placing them there it also sort of
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
messes with the
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
entire um sentencing scheme by making
 
02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
sentences for crimes that are
 
02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
intentional versus negligent or you know
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
bad accidents unintentional um have
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
higher penalties than for example uh a
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault or a kidnapping I
 
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
mean this this bill what it does is it
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
would make the penalty for first offense
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
felony aggravated DUI
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
where the harm caused is
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
unintentional greater than for a first
 
02:23:23.950 --> 02:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
degree assault or a kidnapping where the
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
person is actually intentionally harming
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
someone so I I think that's a that's a
 
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:31.670 align:start position:0%
someone so I I think that's a that's a
major

02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%

she was kind of speaking to both of
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
these bills and she just brought a lot
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%

G
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um first of all enhance um
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
penalties I typically struggle with
 
02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
because I really don't believe that it's
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
a deterrent never has been for any
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
situation but even more importantly um
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
you I don't think you were were you in
 
02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
here when Katherine Cooper was talking
 
02:36:41.469 --> 02:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
because she talked about how
 
02:36:41.479 --> 02:36:44.510 align:start position:0%
because she talked about how
confusing

02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
um represent je I believe she was
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
confused by host 179 we're on this is
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
the executive
 
02:36:59.230 --> 02:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
S7 347 uh I'm aware that this bill 347
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
passed in transportation last year I
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
believe unanimously and all it is is was
 
02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
what was believed to be a housekeeping
 
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
matter where it was the only driving
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
offense that we could find where the out
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
ofate an out State Defense was not taken
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
02:37:20.269 --> 02:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh it did pass on Transportation
 
02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
believe unfortunately was not Tak
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
consideration in the
 
02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
Senate I'm not sure if it was table the
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
house the 19 pmic or t the
 
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
Senate all right can I just say that one
 
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that she had with the
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
out of state for 347 okay was the
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
expense not just for um let's say the
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
defendant but also for the state in
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
order to and and the lymph of a trial
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
and all those types of
 
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
things well I would say this when when
 
02:37:58.990 --> 02:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
I represented someone who's charged with
 
02:38:02.110 --> 02:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
you know offence and out of state
 
02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:03.870 align:start position:0%
you know offence and out of state
conditions

02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
considered the the state has the burden
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
of proving the prior offense so it's the
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
state's job or burden to really get the
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
certified copy of the conviction I know
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
as a defense attorney why would I I
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
won't request it because I would just be
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
requesting incriminating evidence
 
02:38:24.990 --> 02:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
against my client I feel ethically that
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea public record I will
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
leave it to the the government to to do
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
their job they're the ones that have to
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
prove the case if they fail to get that
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
information for whatever reason whether
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's by their own discretion or they
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
just failed to do it what would happen
 
02:38:43.710 --> 02:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
is they're not going to prove the prior
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
offense and that it would simply just be
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
to be considered a first offense if it's
 
02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
in state it's much easier to get that
 
02:38:53.950 --> 02:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
information so I is an expense request
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
certified copies of the from
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
theard uh I I suppose it's the charges
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
by state but it's it's it's really not
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
that when I say expensive it's not
 
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
something that I would say is uh overly
 
02:39:13.950 --> 02:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
certifi yes okay and the other thing is
 
02:39:21.630 --> 02:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
that um not only let's say Massachusetts
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
their laws are different from New
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in most places they a little
 
02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
bit different so that also meant as she
 
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
said that you had to learn the law of
 
02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:29.630 align:start position:0%
said that you had to learn the law of
that

02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
land so I thought that was quite
 
02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
interesting and my last question is
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
within the seven Why seven years
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
preceding the date of the
 
02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
second I mean verse two years ver 10
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
years the seven years is already the
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's I don't know where that number
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
came from I
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
just problem with seven I just this was
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
just simply allowing you to take into
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
consideration a oy conviction for a
 
02:39:58.240 --> 02:39:59.469 align:start position:0%
consideration a oy conviction for a
similar

02:39:59.469 --> 02:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
offense again it's the the government's
 
02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
burden to prove that it's a similar
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
offense if they can't prove that again
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're GNA have to make that
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
presentation otherwise I a problem heing
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
you're G have to I would you say provide
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
similar representative
 
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
Pratt that
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
same drivers Track Trail truck drivers
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
used to have a driver's license in every
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
state they used to have multiple
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
offenses go state to state have offenses
 
02:40:42.269 --> 02:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
all over the country and they said that
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
they could never r that in today there's
 
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
one commercial driver license you truck
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
driver and any any ticket or any find
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
you get in any other state goes against
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
that license so I don't think it would
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
be that much of a problem to prove
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
person in another state they had two or
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
three strikes against them and then they
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire to get away from
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
those two or three
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
strikes I don't think it be that hard to
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
prove where they came from they already
 
02:41:05.950 --> 02:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
have strikes against them on drun
 
02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.150 align:start position:0%
have strikes against them on drun
driving

02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
driving
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
charges or suspension
 
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
rication something that can't be done we
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
said that they could never do it
 
02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:18.750 align:start position:0%
said that they could never do it
on

02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:19.730 align:start position:0%
I think it's something that could
 
02:41:19.730 --> 02:41:20.990 align:start position:0%
I think it's something that could

he represent PR do you mind repeating
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
what you said just saying a little
 
02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:29.950 align:start position:0%
what you said just saying a little
louder

02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
louder
 
02:41:34.429 --> 02:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
yeah um so tractor trailer truck drivers
 
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago maybe 30 years ago
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
used to have multiple drivers license
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
across the country and they would get
 
02:41:42.670 --> 02:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
tickets or fines or violations in the
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
state that they were in and then if they
 
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
lost that license it was okay they had
 
02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
other licenses they had in other states
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
and they said at that time it would be
 
02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
impossible in order to bring all these
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
states together to try to figure out if
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
a person has charges in another state
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
that has all beened now one driver's
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
license when you're a truck driver
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
anything you do in another state goes
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
against that license and I don't think
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
this is much different I think if you're
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
driving under a revocation or suspension
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think it' be a problem that um
 
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
you can find that out in another state
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe somebody would move from a
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
that they've had two or three violations
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
in to a state where they didn't have
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
violations if this isn't isn't corrected
 
02:42:23.230 --> 02:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
they could move here from another state
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
where they have multiple violations and
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
then um it's not all over again it's not
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
the clock all over again so I think this
 
02:42:32.349 --> 02:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
is something that could be can be done
 
02:42:34.429 --> 02:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
reasonably you can find out from another
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
state if they have multiple strikes
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
against them and I think it's worthwhile
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to have somebody
 
02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
start on the clock all over three times
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
in another state or another state
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
multiple times so so I think it's
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
something that's easily easily it's a
 
02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
fix seeing no no hands raised uh the

02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
without parole for juvenile convicted of
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
homicide decades ago in the tough on
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
crime 80s and 90s many states stoked by
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
fear of teen super Predators enacted law
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
to punish juvenile criminals like adults
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
the us became an international sent
 
02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
sentencing offenders under 18 to live
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
out their lives in prison for homicide
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
and sometimes rape kidnapping or arm
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
robbery there has since been a
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
shift several years ago the US Supreme
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
Court banned mandatory life without
 
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
parole for juveniles in murder
 
02:47:42.269 --> 02:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
cases then last year and I think this
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
2019 the court went further saying the
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
more than 2,000 already serving such
 
02:47:52.870 --> 02:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
sentences must get an opportunity chance
 
02:47:55.590 --> 02:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
to show their crime did not reflect
 
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
irreparable corruption and if not have
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
some Hope For
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom so we say that because in
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example there's
 
02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.910 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example there's
roughly

02:48:08.910 --> 02:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:11.349 align:start position:0%
roughly
53

02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
53
 
02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
juveniles on life without parole
 
02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
in 2015 Vermont eliminated life without
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
parole 14 17 and younger New Hampshire
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
the statistics that I was able to get
 
02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
says that New Hampshire has five inmates
 
02:48:29.950 --> 02:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
life without parole for crimes committed
 
02:48:31.870 --> 02:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
at the age of
 
02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
17 um there were a hearing scheduled for
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
two and the other two have not been
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled and I believe that one was
 
02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled but refused to go to defend
 
02:48:44.429 --> 02:48:44.439 align:start position:0%
himself in that hearing and Maine has no
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
joke juvenile
 
02:48:49.469 --> 02:48:49.479 align:start position:0%
inmates so more importantly United
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
States is the only country that has life
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
without parole for juveniles and
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
medically speaking it's been documented
 
02:49:01.950 --> 02:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
over and over
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
again that a juvenile typically their
 
02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
reasoning and thought patterings do not
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
mature until in the mid
 
02:49:15.309 --> 02:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
20s so
 
02:49:19.229 --> 02:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
now I guess I could take questions if
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to but the prime spor
 
02:49:27.150 --> 02:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
does plan on being here later
 
02:49:30.229 --> 02:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
on and just just is the intent of the
 
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
chair to uh accomodate representative
 
02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
B's uh schedule I know
 
02:49:38.229 --> 02:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
he's yeah and I do know that there are
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
others that are
 
02:49:42.990 --> 02:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
testifying as well I'm just saying that
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
in case I forget someone can remind
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
it happens okay representative
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%

Ages were on the ones that killed that
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
woman in the Mount Vernon
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
case I'm just going to is this recently
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh about five years ago well then I
 
02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
would say that's one of these 17y
 
02:50:13.429 --> 02:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
olds I know the answer that
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank do you not know the
 
02:50:23.950 --> 02:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
answer well um like I said the paperwork
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
that I found said that all of them were
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
17 that were in prison here in New
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if uh representative
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
Spen um has some more updated
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
information I don't have a problem
 
02:50:39.229 --> 02:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative Spen you may want to
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
address that thank you Mr chair um one
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
was 17 and the other was 19 thank you
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Welch ask for
 
02:50:51.070 --> 02:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
question representative are you familiar
 
02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
with a Pamela Smart Case and the three
 
02:50:58.269 --> 02:50:58.279 align:start position:0%
juveniles who committed the crime yes
 
02:50:59.910 --> 02:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know where they are now they're not
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
in prison she
 
02:51:06.349 --> 02:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
is okay just thought i' bring that up
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
because not all
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
juveniles get life without parole and
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
those that
 
02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
those that
do

02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
a long
 
02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
time I'm to I believe that too they get
 
02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
a long time but what we're saying is
 
02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:26.790 align:start position:0%
a long time but what we're saying is
that

02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
um their lives matter as well and again
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
they're in a what I would say more a not
 
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
a mature state of mind and I would like
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
to believe that in this
 
02:51:45.150 --> 02:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
society that someone has that has been
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
in prison for a while and um is worthy
 
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
of Rehabilitation and especially our
 
02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.510 align:start position:0%
of Rehabilitation and especially our
young

02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
young
 
02:51:55.950 --> 02:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
people and there was speaking of this
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
but I left it at home I just happened to
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
be online yesterday and there was
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
African-American male that had been in
 
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
prisoned for murder 86 years old was
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
released yesterday and he had been there
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
kid so obviously some somebody had
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
decided what he was 86 years old and I
 
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
guess well at this point he cannot do
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
any damage in life so let's just release
 
02:52:24.590 --> 02:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
him but he was also one of those that
 
02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
him but he was also one of those that
were

02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:52:33.510 --> 02:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:36.429 --> 02:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
Coro seeing no further hands raised I
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:54.990 align:start position:0%
is representative Tony
 
02:52:54.990 --> 02:53:05.590 align:start position:0%
is representative Tony
[Music]

02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
chairman they raise their hand if
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
they're there if any members of the
 
02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
public wish to testify that have not
 
02:53:20.510 --> 02:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
testified already uh please raise your
 
02:53:24.229 --> 02:53:24.239 align:start position:0%

representative is there a someone here
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
to testify on behalf of the office of
 
02:53:32.030 --> 02:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
the child
 
02:53:35.630 --> 02:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
Advocates I see a hand of yes Mr
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%

testifying in support or opposition to
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:53:53.950 --> 02:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
632 good morning this is Moira O'Neal
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
can you hear
 
02:53:57.630 --> 02:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
me yes we can hear you great thank you
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Moira O'Neal I
 
02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
am the child advocate for the State of
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I appreciate the
 
02:54:07.550 --> 02:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity U Mr chair to speak uh in
 
02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
02:54:12.990 --> 02:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
632 um the office of the child advocate
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
is uh an independent oversight agency
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
recently our jurisdiction expanded to
 
02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
Children's Services All Children's
 
02:54:23.389 --> 02:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
Services that are provided or arranged
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
by the state however our Focus will
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
always be children who are involved
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
either in child protection or Juvenile
 
02:54:32.670 --> 02:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
Justice so we put we support House Bill
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
632 um sentencing a child to life
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
without parole even for a crime of
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
homicide runs contrary to what we know
 
02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
about the developing brain of children
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the brain continues to grow and mature
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
through early adulthood reasoning and
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
critical thinking capacity evolves as
 
02:54:52.590 --> 02:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
the brain grows and we know that
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
children are more susceptible to
 
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
influence given their developmental
 
02:54:58.670 --> 02:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
capacity so we think about children as
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
learning from mistakes or listening to
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
what they're told and that sort of part
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
of growing up but actually a far it's a
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
far more complex process than that um we
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
now know from really elegant Imaging
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
studies and other research that the
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
frontal lobe of the brain including that
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
front prefrontal cortex is still
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
developing well into the mid 20s and the
 
02:55:21.590 --> 02:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
structure and function of that part of
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
the brain determines a Young Person's
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
ability to think critically and to
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
reason um and to see even right from
 
02:55:30.309 --> 02:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
wrong so the lack of development in that
 
02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
area of the brain is often cited to
 
02:55:35.110 --> 02:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
explain antisocial behavior um children
 
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
may not actually have the capacity to
 
02:55:39.469 --> 02:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate their consequences of their
 
02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
actions um so this extent of brain
 
02:55:44.190 --> 02:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
development adolescence meaning from the
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
the ages of 10 to 24 can be influenced
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
by many factors that we're learning more
 
02:55:50.229 --> 02:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
about all the time including
 
02:55:52.590 --> 02:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
environmental stress risky Behavior drug
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
use sleep sex hormones nutrition and
 
02:55:58.030 --> 02:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
other things their psychological status
 
02:55:59.950 --> 02:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
and that means as these influences build
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
up in the developing brain a child's
 
02:56:03.790 --> 02:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
brain at age 12 is very different than
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
at 16 and then more different at 18 um
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so on so most importantly the part
 
02:56:12.510 --> 02:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
of the brain key to reasoning it insight
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
and cause and effect is the last part of
 
02:56:17.429 --> 02:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
the brain to develop um so these
 
02:56:19.309 --> 02:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
significant differences in children's
 
02:56:21.630 --> 02:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
capacity given their developing brains
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
and the unique circumstances in which
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
many of them come into the Juvenile
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
Justice System including trauma
 
02:56:29.349 --> 02:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
experiences should really be considered
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
in rendering sentences uh sentencing
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
decisions about their lives in the
 
02:56:37.269 --> 02:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
crimin criminal justice system children
 
02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
who commit the crime of homicide are
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
often severely abused and neglected and
 
02:56:44.349 --> 02:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
have experienced a tumultuous home home
 
02:56:46.750 --> 02:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
life similarities have been found among
 
02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
children who commit murder including
 
02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
having unreliable and ineffective
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%

02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
rejected or abandoned by a parent but
 
02:57:02.110 --> 02:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
the science tells us is the cause for
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
children's Behavior it also predicts
 
02:57:06.910 --> 02:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
children's brains that will grow past
 
02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
that behavior um if they're able to
 
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
engage and be provided with Supportive
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
Services so it's not entirely hopeless
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
um children will become better um
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
citizens so over the past 20 years and
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
what we've learned in science about the
 
02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
developing brain has influenced a series
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
of decisions by the United States
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court regarding juvenile
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
sentencing and proportional punishment
 
02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
in 2005 the United States Supreme Court
 
02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
decided in Roper V Simmons in which it
 
02:57:39.150 --> 02:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
ruled that the eth and the 14th
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
amendments of the Constitution ban
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
imposition of the death penalty on
 
02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
offenders who were under 18 at the time
 
02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
the crime was committed the crime found
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the court found that three
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
differences between juveniles and adults
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that juvenile offenders
 
02:58:00.229 --> 02:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
can't be reliable um to be classified
 
02:58:03.229 --> 02:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
among the worst offenders first as any
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
parent knows and as the scientific
 
02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
sociological studies um tend to confirm
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped
 
02:58:14.269 --> 02:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
sense of responsibility are found in
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
more often than in adults and are more
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
understandable among the young these
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
qualities often result in impetuous and
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
Ill considered actions and decisions
 
02:58:26.830 --> 02:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
second as I mentioned earlier juveniles
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
are more vulnerable or susceptible to
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
negative influences and outside
 
02:58:34.030 --> 02:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
pressures including peer pressure and
 
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
third the Supreme Court stated that the
 
02:58:39.309 --> 02:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
character of a juvenile is not as well
 
02:58:41.630 --> 02:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
formed as that of an adult so
 
02:58:43.990 --> 02:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
personality traits of juveniles are more
 
02:58:46.389 --> 02:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
transitory un less fixed that's all
 
02:58:49.150 --> 02:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
coming from the court um and then later
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
in Graham versus Florida um decided in
 
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
2010 the Supreme Court ruled that the
 
02:58:56.510 --> 02:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
eth Amendment to the United States
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution does not permit a sentence
 
02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
of life without parole for juveniles
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime other than homicide
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
in that case the court found that life
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
without parole is an especially harsh
 
02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
punishment for a juvenile under this
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
sentence a juvenile offender will on
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
average served more years and a great
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of his time in prison than an
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
adult offender and it further noted that
 
02:59:23.469 --> 02:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
deterrence does not suffice to justify
 
02:59:26.550 --> 02:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
the sentence and they cited Roper the
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
court stated that the same
 
02:59:29.469 --> 02:59:29.479 align:start position:0%
characteristics that render juveniles
 
02:59:31.110 --> 02:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
less capable and adults suggest that
 
02:59:34.030 --> 02:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
juveniles will be less susceptible to
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
deterrence again in another case in
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
2012 Miller versus Alabama drawing from
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
its decisions in roer and Graham the
 
02:59:43.870 --> 02:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
court decided that the eighth of
 
02:59:45.710 --> 02:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment forbids imposition of a
 
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
mandatory life without parole sentence
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
for juvenile offenders convicted of
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
homicide the court explained that
 
02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
children are con constitutionally
 
02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
different from adults for purposes of
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
sentencing so it found that Graham's
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
flatband on life without without parole
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
for non-homicide crimes noting that
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
Graham said about children is crime
 
03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
specific those features are evident in
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
the same way and to the same degree if a
 
03:00:14.349 --> 03:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
botched robbery turns into a Kill
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
so Graham's reasoning implicates any
 
03:00:18.590 --> 03:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
life without parole sentence imposed on
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
a juvenile even as its categorical bar
 
03:00:24.910 --> 03:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
relates only to non homicide offenses so
 
03:00:27.510 --> 03:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
most fundamentally Graham insists that
 
03:00:29.110 --> 03:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
youth matters in determining the
 
03:00:30.550 --> 03:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of a lifetime
 
03:00:32.830 --> 03:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
incarceration without the possibility of
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
Parole in 2014 the New Hampshire Supreme
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
Court ruled in Petition of the State of
 
03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that Miller decision
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
applied retroactively to four New
 
03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire respondents who had been
 
03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
convicted as juveniles of life without
 
03:00:50.110 --> 03:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
parole for homicide and while Miller
 
03:00:51.950 --> 03:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
while the Miller Court considered
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence of life without
 
03:00:56.349 --> 03:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
parole its reasoning applies equally to
 
03:00:58.750 --> 03:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
any sentence of life without parole for
 
03:01:01.469 --> 03:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
juveniles so Banning life without peal
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
sentences for juveniles who commit
 
03:01:05.309 --> 03:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
homicide will codify the principles
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
espoused in those cases regarding
 
03:01:09.870 --> 03:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
sentencing of juveniles will also bring
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire into alignment with other
 
03:01:14.429 --> 03:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
states there are 24 States and the
 
03:01:16.229 --> 03:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
District of Colombia that have banned
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
life sentences without the possibility
 
03:01:20.990 --> 03:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
of parole for juveniles four states have
 
03:01:25.150 --> 03:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:27.870 --> 03:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
parole we do have to limit testimony we
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
have been limiting two to three minutes
 
03:01:33.070 --> 03:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
for hearing okay sure sure so I'm happy
 
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
to take questions if you have any we're
 
03:01:38.110 --> 03:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
at seven minutes so we do need to uh I
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
do need to ask you to suspend the
 
03:01:43.150 --> 03:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
chair's a mistake for it not clarifying
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
that before you any teson sure
 
03:01:47.469 --> 03:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
understood if you have questions I'll
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
answer them otherwise thank you for
 
03:01:52.269 --> 03:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
taking my Tes question uh thank you Mr
 
03:01:54.190 --> 03:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
question um in your testimony you spoke
 
03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
of uh the brain development from 10 to
 
03:02:04.990 --> 03:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
24 years old now in the 2010 Kimberly
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
Gates case one individual that was
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
charged with first-degree murder was 17
 
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
the other one first-degree murder was um
 
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
19 you know this bill if I understand it
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
right is just anybody under 18 um so why
 
03:02:25.389 --> 03:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
not the 19y old if what you're saying is
 
03:02:29.070 --> 03:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the 10 to 24 year old
 
03:02:31.990 --> 03:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know brain isn't mature enough sure
 
03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much for that
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
question and and if we if we followed
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
the science then we would extend out the
 
03:02:40.349 --> 03:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
the age limit I think um what you're
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
considering is what is politically
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
expedient um but certainly the
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
scientists and the advocates for
 
03:02:49.150 --> 03:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
children would argue for um for an older
 
03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
age and I will tell you from experience
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
because we meet with children at the
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
cunu Youth Services Center often um that
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
I've actually um had the opportunity to
 
03:03:01.229 --> 03:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
meet and and um and know children who
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
are moving on not necessarily for life
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
without parole but for for children who
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
come into the system early say around
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
age 14 and then leave at 18 for an
 
03:03:13.710 --> 03:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
adults system um it's a completely
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
different individual um there's a
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
there's a child at age 14 who has done
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
something um that was wrong and
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
certainly acknowledges it but at 18 it's
 
03:03:25.950 --> 03:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a young adult who has
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
completed schooling is taken college
 
03:03:30.429 --> 03:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
courses is helping out with other
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
students um a completely different and
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
responsible person whose life um that he
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
has to look forward to um is behind
 
03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
has to look forward to um is behind
prison

03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
prison
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for your testimony
 
03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
and the chair would would uh inquire
 
03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
like to ask a question I want to thank
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
you in advance for taking my question uh
 
03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you stated that the
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
development of the human brain does not
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
complete is not completed
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
to an average adult reaches the age of
 
03:04:10.190 --> 03:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
the mid 20s if that is if that is the
 
03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
case why would this be this law what's
 
03:04:14.429 --> 03:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of having this simply be at the
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
age of you know the juvenile age
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be the age of mid
 
03:04:21.190 --> 03:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
20 thank you for that question Mr chair
 
03:04:23.790 --> 03:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
and and it's somewhat of a a repeat of
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
the other question in in in terms of the
 
03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
age limits um as I said the science
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
would support extending out um a piece
 
03:04:34.429 --> 03:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
of legislation like this to older youth
 
03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
up to age 24 um but as as as we all have
 
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
to consider in public policy what's
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
expedient for the community what the
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
community is comfortable with I would
 
03:04:48.750 --> 03:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
stand by um advocating for it to include
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
older youth um but understand that that
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.070 --> 03:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
pass thank you for take my question to
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative CL
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
night thank you chairman and thank you
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so if I'm
 
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying is that
 
03:05:14.229 --> 03:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
um the age that's written in this bill
 
03:05:16.510 --> 03:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
now is okay because we have to start
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere is that correct thank you for
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
the question yes it is it would be it
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be a far better Bill if it um if
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
it extended the age up to
 
03:05:29.250 --> 03:05:29.260 align:start position:0%
24 thank
 
03:05:29.260 --> 03:05:34.590 align:start position:0%
24 thank

you chairman Vice chair and uh committee
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
having me with you today um I am Eric
 
03:06:17.469 --> 03:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
Alexander and I serve as senior advocate
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
for the campaign for the fair sing of
 
03:06:21.229 --> 03:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
Youth where we work to replace like with
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
our parole and Other Extreme penalties
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
for children with age appropriate
 
03:06:26.190 --> 03:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
responses to their actions as mentioned
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
earlier the US Supreme Court has made
 
03:06:29.790 --> 03:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
several rulings on this issue and has
 
03:06:31.630 --> 03:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
concluded that it should be reserved and
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
applied only in cases where the
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
individual is determined to be
 
03:06:36.670 --> 03:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
encourageable went on to add that youth
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
should be awful a reasonable opportunity
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
for release since then the majority of
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
the country has moved away from life
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%

co-found which is I can um and you know
 
03:06:58.710 --> 03:06:58.720 align:start position:0%

03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
offenses and are now home living
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
productive lives as uh you know some as
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
Elementary School teachers some as
 
03:07:11.309 --> 03:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
substance abuse counselors paral leals
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs um um Etc contributing to
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
the communities in a variety of positive
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
ways with the understanding that you
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
know they could never repay what they
 
03:07:22.710 --> 03:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
took um you know they cons decided to
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
find their time in prison uh finding
 
03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
ways to repay Society for the mistakes
 
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
that they made um you know these youth
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
are not monsters you know I can testify
 
03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
to that because I was once one of those
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
children um at the age of 17 I was part
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
of a crime that cost a man his life and
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
two I was on a case with a 19y old um
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and you know also a 16y old
 
03:07:45.309 --> 03:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
the only way that I avoided life without
 
03:07:46.830 --> 03:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility of herole was that I
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
play guilty to two 25 year sentences I
 
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
served 10 years at that time and I'm
 
03:07:53.349 --> 03:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
home now um I've been home now for 17
 
03:07:55.150 --> 03:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
years since that time um I've been
 
03:07:57.389 --> 03:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
employed by organizations like the YMCA
 
03:07:59.070 --> 03:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
the Metro Public School System here in
 
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
Nashville Tennessee um and and now I'm
 
03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
um you know entering my fourth year in
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
my tenure with the campaign for the fair
 
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
sentencing of Youth so I said all you
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
know all of that to say that these are
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
the type of things that these youth are
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
capable of when they come home at a
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable time um again I went to
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
prison at the age of 17 and I came home
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
at 28 you know since then um you know
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a married man um I have two
 
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful daughters the age of of five
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
and three so I've been able to put my
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
life back together in a very meaningful
 
03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
way and I truly believe that this is
 
03:08:30.910 --> 03:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court said when they
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
meant that these children should have a
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity for release now
 
03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
as someone who spent time in prison I'll
 
03:08:38.910 --> 03:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that not all youth will meet
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
the parole board standard but you know
 
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
they should have an opportunity to sit
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
in front of parole board and have the
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
parole board to U have an opinion on if
 
03:08:49.830 --> 03:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
they are a citizen that's that's um
 
03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
available for release or if they are
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
someone who needs to spend more time in
 
03:08:55.469 --> 03:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
prison getting their lives together uh
 
03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands
 
03:09:09.309 --> 03:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
raised the witness is
 
03:09:12.190 --> 03:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
excused at this time uh the chair I
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Paul
 
03:09:17.630 --> 03:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
bur uh I did state that testimony will
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
be limited to two minutes per witness
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
however representative bur was the Prime
 
03:09:23.309 --> 03:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor was unavailable at the start of
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing so there will be some
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility with that respect for the
 
03:09:30.030 --> 03:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair I
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the courtesies I've received
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
from you in the committee I was tied up
 
03:09:37.309 --> 03:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
in judiciary doing execs until a few
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
moments ago um I am the prime sponsor of
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
HB 632 my name is Paul Birch I represent
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
chesher 1 which are the towns of West
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
Milan Walpole Chesterfield and Hinsdale
 
03:09:52.269 --> 03:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
along the banks of the beautiful
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River um I assume by now you
 
03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
have heard from uh various experts and
 
03:10:03.229 --> 03:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
and other folks who have an interest in
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I wasn't able to hear them
 
03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
because I was tied up but I will keep my
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
marks quite short so as not to repeat
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
what they likely said
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
um I filed this bill in part because
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually I got a pretty thoughtful
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
letter from an inmate at the conquered
 
03:10:22.750 --> 03:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
State Prison who would not be subject to
 
03:10:25.150 --> 03:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
this bill but felt that this would be an
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
important bill judging from uh what he
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
has learned and what he has seen um as a
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
former public defender and as a
 
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislator I get a lot of such mail this
 
03:10:40.269 --> 03:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
one kind of struck me uh in a certain
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
way so I I decided to file the bill uh
 
03:10:46.510 --> 03:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
as has been noted this bill does not
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee the release of any offender
 
03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
just a review after a reasonable period
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
of incarceration with an individualized
 
03:10:58.110 --> 03:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
assessment of course of unique
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances of each in offender and I
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to make a point I don't know if it
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
was made earlier but it also allows the
 
03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:06.990 align:start position:0%
was made earlier but it also allows the
victim's

03:11:06.990 --> 03:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
victim's
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
family and friends to possibly evolve
 
03:11:13.389 --> 03:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
their own thinking
 
03:11:15.389 --> 03:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
about what a just and a compassionate
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
sentence might be at uh a point in time
 
03:11:23.429 --> 03:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
maybe a year after the uh the loss of a
 
03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
loved one from a violent crime they may
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
have one point of view and 30 years
 
03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
later they may or may not have a
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
different point of view and I think it's
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
respectful of those folks to say yes we
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
want to hear your changed point of view
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
if you have it or you're not non-change
 
03:11:46.349 --> 03:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
point of view and take that into account
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
in figuring out the continued sentence
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
or not as you have heard Most states
 
03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
have either eliminated this Statute in
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
law or in
 
03:11:58.510 --> 03:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
practice uh and this is based on what we
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
know of Child
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
Development uh our knowledge of Child
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
Development has changed a lot over the
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
last few decades uh and that's been
 
03:12:09.229 --> 03:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
reflected in Court decisions which I'm
 
03:12:12.190 --> 03:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
sure have been mentioned to you uh in
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
the earlier testimony you know
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
immaturity of children Su
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
susceptibility to outside pressures and
 
03:12:22.830 --> 03:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
influences inability to assess
 
03:12:25.469 --> 03:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
consequences all suggest that punishment
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
for adults should be considered
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
different than punishment for children
 
03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
there's a cost factor of course it's
 
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
expensive to jail folks the national
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
average is about 35,000 a year it goes
 
03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:41.229 align:start position:0%
average is about 35,000 a year it goes
up

03:12:41.229 --> 03:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
tremendously for for geriatric prisoners
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that's larger than this
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh but it's an issue that uh uh
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
affects all of us who work in our County
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh budget committees and uh on our state
 
03:13:02.990 --> 03:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
budgets but the costs of care for
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
geriatric prisoners is double that of
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
younger prisoners so um it's an issue as
 
03:13:14.429 --> 03:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would like has to look at uh
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's an issue of Rehabilitation and
 
03:13:19.830 --> 03:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative programs if you have a
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
child who's locked up for life there's
 
03:13:25.229 --> 03:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
little incentive to give him or her any
 
03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
kind of meaningful Rehabilitation under
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the theory that they're not going to
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
ever be released um that's not good
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
penology it's not good uh it it's not
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
good corrections to have that approach
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
but it's there I hate to say it but
 
03:13:44.429 --> 03:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
there's racial
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
disparities in a lot of the criminal
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
justice issues and this one is no
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
exception uh the imposition of life in
 
03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
prison without parole for children is
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
has been found to be racially uh
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
disperate um similar in capital
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
punishment and and other kinds of
 
03:14:11.630 --> 03:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
similar issues so briefly that's uh
 
03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
where I'm at filing this bill it's a
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan bill it's not uh left or
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
right I it's uh it's a good government
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill um and basically sentences that
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
sentence juveniles to jail for the rest
 
03:14:31.950 --> 03:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
of their lives without the best
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of parole close the door on
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and Second Chances deny
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
the family and friends of the victim the
 
03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
chance to revisit rethink their position
 
03:14:46.229 --> 03:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
about what an appropriate sentence is
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
and it's basically cruel and misguided
 
03:14:54.750 --> 03:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will support uh passing HB
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.590 --> 03:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
you representative first I want first
 
03:15:06.030 --> 03:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
May inquire H
 
03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with the the
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
PRI Witness reference the Miller ver
 
03:15:13.359 --> 03:15:14.630 align:start position:0%
PRI Witness reference the Miller ver
Alabama

03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
Alabama
 
03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
case and I believe that my understanding
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the holding in that case and please
 
03:15:23.229 --> 03:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
just correct me if I'm wrong uh for a
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
juvenile the Supreme Court ruled that
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
they can't be a mandatory sentence of
 
03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
life without parole for a juvenile
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
however a juvenile could still be
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
sentenced to life without parole but
 
03:15:37.150 --> 03:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's just the law can't mandate that is
 
03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
that would you agree that that is the
 
03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
holding in the M Alabama case that is
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
correct and then my my thank you for
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question my followup question
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
is in the state of New
 
03:15:53.710 --> 03:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hamshire with the exception of
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
first-degree murder are there any
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
other offenses that you are aware of
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
where the mandatory sentence would be
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
juvenile where they would be sent that
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
that juvenile would be
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
sentenced life
 
03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
Al no I'm not aware of
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
any thank to this would really just
 
03:16:16.189 --> 03:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
apply to first degree murder we're aware
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
of I believe so I mean I have to check
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
on SEC with the penalty on second
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
deegree murder is because I think maybe
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's the same penalty
 
03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
for first and second but I'm not
 
03:16:31.349 --> 03:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
positive of that I think
 
03:16:35.389 --> 03:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
and someone I just up I was looking at
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
that right before I asked the question
 
03:16:40.990 --> 03:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
the uh RSA 630 would apply I believe
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
First to be murder it's
 
03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
life uple but second degree you can he
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
sent this to a have a life sentence but
 
03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:52.750 align:start position:0%
it's not
necessarily

03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
um the automatic
 
03:16:57.150 --> 03:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
Deni I'm only wear first agre I'm just
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's any other offenses
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
right but under uh you under the Miller
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
case the the mandatory life without uh
 
03:17:08.630 --> 03:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh parole for juveniles is not allowed
 
03:17:12.070 --> 03:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
anymore yeah so I guess the feeling is
 
03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:15.990 align:start position:0%
anymore yeah so I guess the feeling is
that

03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.269 --> 03:17:18.279 align:start position:0%
So based on the testimony and the your
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
understanding of the Miller vers Alabama
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
case RSA
 
03:17:26.670 --> 03:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
6301 if a juvenile was convicted of
 
03:17:27.790 --> 03:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
first degree
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
murder that sentence has applied in that
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance would violate
 
03:17:34.150 --> 03:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
that Supreme Court
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
holding if they were given the Mandate
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
given as a mandatory yes I
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
agree thank you representative none of
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.710 --> 03:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking my
 
03:17:56.429 --> 03:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
question um just wanted a little
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on the build of the way
 
03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's the way that it's actually written
 
03:18:03.189 --> 03:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
um is it possible under your bill for a
 
03:18:05.550 --> 03:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
juvenile to still receive a life
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
sentence for a crime but with the
 
03:18:10.830 --> 03:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
stipulation that uh that they would be
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
Point under this bill a juvenile could
 
03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
still be sentenced to life
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
imprisonment there's no guarantee of any
 
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
parole all this does is say that at some
 
03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
point in time the juvenile is entitled
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
to a hearing before a parole board which
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
can say yes or can say no in other words
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
if the parole board thinks each time or
 
03:18:46.630 --> 03:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
whenever they see this person that this
 
03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
person should remain in jail and that's
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the decision that is made for the rest
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
of that person's natural life that's
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
what will
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
happen thank you that was my assumption
 
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.389 --> 03:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
again represent the chair May inquire
 
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
follow question I'll this is just my
 
03:19:13.229 --> 03:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
reading of what would If This Were to
 
03:19:16.389 --> 03:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
pass and signed the law it would a new
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
section RSA
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
6307 would appeal I'm reading that to
 
03:19:25.229 --> 03:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
say that no juvenile convicted as an
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
adult for an
 
03:19:30.189 --> 03:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
offense can be sentenced to life prison
 
03:19:33.070 --> 03:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
so although that would satisfy the the
 
03:19:35.070 --> 03:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
Miller versus Alabama
 
03:19:38.830 --> 03:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
holding I'm reading this to not allow
 
03:19:44.790 --> 03:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
any circumstance where a is sentenced to
 
03:19:48.189 --> 03:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
life is on the second Dee murder it's
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
some discretionary facts May considered
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
by the judge to actually you know issue
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
a life sentence but it's just not a
 
03:19:59.189 --> 03:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory sent I guess my question is
 
03:20:01.950 --> 03:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that differ we
 
03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that differ we
testify

03:20:05.550 --> 03:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I'm not sure I follow
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I try to make it as clear me and Os
 
03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
can make it that I mean the Supreme the
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has ruled out for for this
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
category of offender uh life in prison
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
with uh mandatory life in prison without
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
parole that's off the
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
table this takes it that sentence of
 
03:20:35.469 --> 03:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
life in prison without parole for a
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
juvenile convicted of of this offense
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
off the table and means there has to be
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
some ability to face a parole board does
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
not guarantee parole it just says you
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
have a right to ask for parole or or
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:23.349 --> 03:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:30.910 --> 03:21:30.920 align:start position:0%

03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
since 2009 and so we have uh been active
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
in States all over the country you've
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
heard that 25 States uh so far U
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
including DC 25 have already passed this
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation so the only thing
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
that I really wanted to add uh was just
 
03:22:35.830 --> 03:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
to let you know that if you pass House
 
03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
to let you know that if you pass House
Bill

03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
636 I'm sorry
 
03:22:41.150 --> 03:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
632 you're basically bringing yourself
 
03:22:42.269 --> 03:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
in line
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
not just with your neighbor of of
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont um and Massachusetts but also
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and Virginia and
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
Ohio um Utah and Wyoming and
 
03:22:57.990 --> 03:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
Nevada uh and believe it or not Arkansas
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
and Texas Texas was one of the first
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
states to abolish life without the
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
possibility of parole for kids after the
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
Miller decision in 2012 the very next
 
03:23:10.910 --> 03:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
year Texas passed a law saying that no
 
03:23:13.510 --> 03:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
child could be sentenced to life without
 
03:23:15.790 --> 03:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
parole in their state they basically
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
said that you know if a kid is too young
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
to vote too young to sign a contract too
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
young to serve on a jury or in the
 
03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
military then that person is too young
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be uh condemned to die in prison and
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire would certainly be in
 
03:23:32.349 --> 03:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
good company both conservative and
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
Progressive States the bill we we just
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
saw passed in Ohio Republicans have
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
super majorities in both Chambers in
 
03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
Ohio uh and they took this issue up and
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
and really show that this this is a
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
conservative issue not just a
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
progressive issue and so we're really
 
03:23:50.590 --> 03:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
really happy for this opportunity that
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire has certainly we want
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be a resource for you if if there's
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%

hand thank you Mr chairman and members

of the committee my name is Jeanie hesa
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the political director for the ACLU
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I appreciate the
 
03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appear before you again
 
03:24:57.150 --> 03:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
today uh in support of HB 632 and ending
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
the inhumane practice of sentencing
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
children to life in prison without the
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of parole I want to respond
 
03:25:05.950 --> 03:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the questions that have been
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
asked about whether to extend this to
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
19y olds and I and I appreciate the
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
question and I want to know is as a
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
society we have put significance on the
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
age of 18 this bill does not F does not
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
come up with that distinction between 18
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
and afterwards minors are not considered
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
responsible enough to live away from
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
their parents to make decisions related
 
03:25:31.550 --> 03:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
to their education or medical treatment
 
03:25:34.990 --> 03:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
to vote to sign a contract and yet they
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
can be certified as a so-called adult
 
03:25:39.790 --> 03:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
and sentenced to spend the rest of their
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
lives behind bars
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
what a what an lwop sentence means is
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
that someone is
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
irredeemable I don't know how we say
 
03:25:51.630 --> 03:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
that about a minor who is still
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
developing including cognitively you're
 
03:25:57.550 --> 03:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
saying that a minor a minor somebody as
 
03:26:01.469 --> 03:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
young as 13 14 15 is
 
03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
irredeemable even if given decades to
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate I just don't know how we
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
say that um and I and I think it's
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
really worth noting that the United
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
States is the only country in the world
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
that sentences people under the age of
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
18 to life sentences without the
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
possibility of parole and as previous
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
Witnesses have noted the trend within
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
the United States is to do away with
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
these sentences 24 States plus DC have
 
03:26:32.550 --> 03:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
already done so um so it's a great
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for New Hampshire to
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
catch up um and I just want to note
 
03:26:39.189 --> 03:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
again this bill does not prevent young
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
people from being held accountable that
 
03:26:43.229 --> 03:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
is not the question if you commit a
 
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
heinous crime you should be held
 
03:26:47.349 --> 03:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
accountable this bill simply ensures
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that a minor is not condemned for life
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
for something they did when the world
 
03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
over recognizes them as immature and not
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
fully cognitively developed juveniles
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
who commit heinous crimes would still
 
03:27:03.189 --> 03:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
face accountability they would still
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
face stiff sentences and would still go
 
03:27:08.110 --> 03:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
before the parole board and have to
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
prove that they have been rehabilitated
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
and Worthy of parole so and I and I do
 
03:27:16.349 --> 03:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
want to know as as there have been a
 
03:27:18.269 --> 03:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
couple individual cases referenced in
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there and they're
 
03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
currently a couple cases pending like
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is a very relevant issue here and
 
03:27:26.790 --> 03:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
now um and this is a value question this
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
is a value of what of how our state
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
treats children um so I strongly
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to really
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
consider HB 632 I will know I understand
 
03:27:39.429 --> 03:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion about the wording
 
03:27:43.189 --> 03:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
um given the lwop termin ology um so
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe the wording could be
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
clarified so that the questions that the
 
03:27:48.429 --> 03:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
committee raised about the specific
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
phrasing of the bill um don't continue
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's very clear what the bill is
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
striving to do um but I very very much
 
03:27:57.870 --> 03:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
support the intent of the bill um and
 
03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
urge this committee uh to pass this
 
03:28:04.110 --> 03:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your testimony uh
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%

question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
you for my question and I I guess maybe
 
03:28:18.269 --> 03:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
I should have asked a previous speaker
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
but maybe you know the answered how many
 
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
are currently serving a life sentence
 
03:28:25.710 --> 03:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
that were sentenced under 18 in New
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how many um in the past
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
have been sentenced that and they may
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
not be with us
 
03:28:34.189 --> 03:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
today I don't know that off the top of
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
my head I think the number 17 was
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier today by but that's
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%

that information that I'll definitely
 
03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at but it I don't know if in the
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
information States what my question was
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that you know how many are currently
 
03:30:15.790 --> 03:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
serving life sentence that were
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
sentenced under 18 years of age
 
03:30:21.070 --> 03:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire and then
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
let's say back you know the 200 years
 
03:30:24.910 --> 03:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know 250 years we've been here how
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
many have done that uh representative
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
Bert it's actually a pretty detailed
 
03:30:31.510 --> 03:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
data set you'll find it gives you the
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
age they were at the date of offense it
 
03:30:36.030 --> 03:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
gives you the crime it gives you the
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
date of their crime you'll see a
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
reference to minimum and maximum the
 
03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
numbers 9 9 denote a life sentence Did
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
also give you additional data for people
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
who were serving 50 years or more that's
 
03:30:50.670 --> 03:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
pretty significant um and it has a
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of detail
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
there are public data sets um so we just
 
03:30:58.510 --> 03:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to get that to you I do not could
 
03:31:01.630 --> 03:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
not commit to um some long-term data as
 
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
we switched systems back in 2008 but
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'll try to see what I can find for
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
historical perspective with regard to
 
03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:16.600 align:start position:0%

honors yes people signing in on host
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
Bill 632 there were 152 people who
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
signed in in support uh there were five
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
opposition I'm just we're gonna
 
03:32:07.630 --> 03:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
go a recess very shortly but just
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
something for everyone to think about uh
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
what what I've least been reviewing
 
03:32:13.950 --> 03:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and what we heard
 
03:32:17.349 --> 03:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
from testimony the M Alabama
 
03:32:19.870 --> 03:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
case pretty clear you can't have a
 
03:32:22.590 --> 03:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory life sentence without the
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility eligibility of appr for a
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
juvenile answer the first-degree murder
 
03:32:29.720 --> 03:32:32.510 align:start position:0%
juvenile answer the first-degree murder
law

03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
RSA it's RSA
 
03:32:38.110 --> 03:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
630 one-
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
a states that that offense is is a
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory of Life above the whole
 
03:32:47.309 --> 03:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
so that as written applied to a juvenile
 
03:32:51.710 --> 03:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
would not pass the Supreme Court must
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
that's the holding of Miller versus
 
03:32:57.070 --> 03:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
Alabama uh but something to think about
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
is whether we would want to forbid a
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
life sentence without the possibility a
 
03:33:05.189 --> 03:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
judge can still make our or issue a life
 
03:33:07.469 --> 03:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
sentence it's just a matter
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
of it being mandatory that's doesn't
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
prevent a judge from doing that as part
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the sentence it's
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
just it's confusing but just something
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
to think about do we want to make it so
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to under any
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance for a juvenile to serve a
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
life sentence
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
without so we I think we least need to
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
consider whether we want we have to
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the Mandate of that because
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's the Law's pretty clear on so this
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
something to consider about we'll be uh
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing some executive sessions
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%

Wallace you wish to speak to the motion
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
yes I first like to say I um I apologize
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
I had my notes written on this
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill and I was talking on the
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
other Bill prior um both having to do
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
with driving out of the inflence I
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
apologize for that confusion but we had
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony today
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that is really
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
ringing the bell to me is um there was
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
testimon that well when a person is
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
driving out of influence they're not
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
able to make the best decisions and
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
therefore they shouldn't be held
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
responsible which is a little bit har me
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
and understand um and also listen to
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
miss Shaw's testimony as I was saying
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
before and her you know really bringing
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
to light just using the exact words what
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
they are the son was killed and it
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't by a person that was making a
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
mistake it's a person who made clear
 
04:20:31.119 --> 04:20:32.590 align:start position:0%
mistake it's a person who made clear
conscious

04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
conscious
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
decision to drive while they were drunk
 
04:20:35.880 --> 04:20:38.710 align:start position:0%
decision to drive while they were drunk
repeatedly

04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
and you know schools have a zero
 
04:20:42.429 --> 04:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
tolerance for bullying but yet we don't
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
have a zero tolerance for things like
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
this where you know words can be more
 
04:20:48.189 --> 04:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
harmful than someone drive and drunk is
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
really hard to understand so with that
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
being said
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
representa Muse you
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
recognized yes one of the things we've
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
heard you know over the course of uh you
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
know of this year in criminal justice is
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the the worst case
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
scenario cases don't necessarily
 
04:21:24.670 --> 04:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
translate into the best state
 
04:21:24.680 --> 04:21:26.830 align:start position:0%
translate into the best state
law

04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:21:32.429 --> 04:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
um I I have no doubt that uh that what
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
happened to to Misha and her family is
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
is terrible um but I do have doubts as
 
04:21:41.229 --> 04:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
to whether or not this bill is actually
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to move us any farther towards
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
fixing this problem um I think one of
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard in the
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh were a lot of people who
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
were um uh extremely well-intentioned um
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
who were also trying to explain to us so
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
some other holes that you know that we
 
04:22:05.229 --> 04:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
needed to fix um there were things
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the the instrumentation that
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
takes uh or that uh uh that offenders
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to breathe into uh in order to
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
start their cars
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
um we're looking
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
at an extremely significant increase in
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
the penalty uh for this uh and and I and
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think the and I think one of the
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
things that uh Miss Cooper pointed out
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
to us is that we would actually be
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
making a crime that um I'm not sure
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
anyone would intentionally ever commit
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
um into an offense with a greater
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
punishment into you know then a lot of
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
offenses on our books that people commit
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
with full
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
intent so um I'm regretfully I have to
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
say that uh as the bill currently stands
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.870 --> 04:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I agree with representative Muse and
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
my primary objection to the bill is that
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
there are many ways that you can uh
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
commit aggravated uh DWI and the
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
inclusion of aggregate aggravated
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
DWI Al into the uh laws that cover uh
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
manslaughter and and murder DWI I think
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
is just not appropriate so I'm going to
 
04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
you representative green thank you Mr
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
chair being in Criminal Justice and
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
public safety for four terms and seeing
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills come through where
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're trying to protect the guilty and
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
not the
 
04:24:22.149 --> 04:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
victim and uh I just uh feel bad the
 
04:24:24.670 --> 04:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
victims aren't looked at so much in this
 
04:24:27.109 --> 04:24:27.119 align:start position:0%
state or maybe not this state but just
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
across the
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
you recognize go back several terms ago
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
we had another DWI bill which had a
 
04:24:45.640 --> 04:24:47.189 align:start position:0%
we had another DWI bill which had a
mandatory

B you wish to speak to the amendment yes
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um what the amendment does
 
04:29:55.870 --> 04:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
it basically removes the
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
$1,500 amount out
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
of the current bill that is being
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
proposed and the reason um
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it's hard to determine what
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
values are on some items
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to certain
 
04:30:24.990 --> 04:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
items you know the value may be less but
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
to the person it's
 
04:30:31.469 --> 04:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
everything um so by allowing not to have
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
any amount I think just makes the bill
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
more enhanced
 
04:30:45.550 --> 04:30:45.560 align:start position:0%

04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
much like this one without
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
specifying uh where it would occur um I
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is needed RSA 6274
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
clearly uh addresses this exact same
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
scenario considered in the bill the bill
 
04:34:28.029 --> 04:34:28.039 align:start position:0%
makes it less clear the current statute
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh perfectly addresses this we don't
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:35.840 --> 04:34:42.590 align:start position:0%
bill
representative

04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
Muse you one of my biggest concerns with
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and some others that we've had
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
in this session um that are similar is
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
that uh to a large extent uh these bills
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
are motivated by fears of protests uh uh
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
in other states that simply haven't
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire um I have a
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:07.349 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire um I have a
problem

04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
sorry this it's we as to the quum we not
 
04:35:13.949 --> 04:35:13.959 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak to other members
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
motivate uh motivations for filing the
 
04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill so I just ask if you refrain
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
from that I however you make you may
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
continue I thank
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you I I I I have a general
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
problem with people uh trying to settle
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
arguments or disputes with a with a gun
 
04:35:35.629 --> 04:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
um that's what words are for um and
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
another thing that I worry about in a
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
state that has a first in the nation
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
primary and then one where um where
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
politics seems to be our state sport
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
instead of uh football uh basketball
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
baseball or hockey uh is I worry about
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
the impact on
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
canvassers um I've actually uh
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
experienced an incident myself where uh
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
where I was uh going up to knock doors
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
back in the in the 2016 election uh and
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
I was looking to uh to talk with the uh
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
with the woman of the house uh and the
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
man of the house was outside raking
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
leaves and asked me who I was canvasing
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
for and when I told him uh he pointed at
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
a pistol on at his side so you know
 
04:36:21.551 --> 04:36:21.561 align:start position:0%
these are these are the sort of things
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we open the door to with this bill
 
04:36:26.429 --> 04:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
and I think it's one of the reasons why
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
we really really need to think twice U
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:38.109 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.119 --> 04:36:39.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
gab I just want to remind us that when
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
um and the sign of sheet there was 12 to
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
support and 53 in opposition to this
 
04:36:49.629 --> 04:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that sometimes we
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
really need to take a look at that as
 
04:36:53.949 --> 04:36:53.959 align:start position:0%
why people are opposing bills and or why
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
they're actually supporting a
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:08.429 align:start position:0%
 
information

04:37:08.429 --> 04:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank thanks for letting me
 
04:37:14.551 --> 04:37:14.561 align:start position:0%
speak this bill would provide legal
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
protection to a property owner who is
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
taking an offensive posture with a
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
firearm or another means of
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
self-defense to neutralize or deescalate
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
threat in a criminal threatening
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
situation this doesn't have anything to
 
04:37:29.230 --> 04:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
do with canvasing or being at the mall
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to help you deescalate a
 
04:37:36.750 --> 04:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
situation on your own property or cour
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.390 --> 04:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
that representative true thank you Mr
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
chair um I do support uh this uh this
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe it is it is very
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
possible for uh somebody who
 
04:38:05.949 --> 04:38:05.959 align:start position:0%
is to be found innocent of uh
 
04:38:08.670 --> 04:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
of such an action to be financially
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
ruined just by defending himself in
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
court this CER this restates and
 
04:38:20.349 --> 04:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies the situation where a person
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
is certainly within his legal rights to
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh protect himself in his
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
chair just expand on that by expanding
 
04:38:41.470 --> 04:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
on when a person can defend thems and
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
specifically display a firearm in
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
defensive matter it
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
also specifies and implies when it's not
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate I believe the example
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
provided by representative news just
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
based on what he said to us that would
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
sound very inappropriate display of a
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
fire because it doesn't sound and
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
knowing represented me very well it
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound to me like there was any
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
reason we know what a reasonable person
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
believe that represent whatever caused
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
property damage seriously B injury or
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
death to anyone so that I would say that
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
this clarifies when it's
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate and unfortunately sometimes
 
04:39:18.269 --> 04:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
when laws are more broad it makes it
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
very difficult to prosecute this this
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
really Narrows when it is appropriate so
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
this could be interpreted really as a
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
narrowing of when it's appropriate by
 
04:39:31.830 --> 04:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.840 --> 04:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:44.070 align:start position:0%
so
ause

04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
something that I think we need to
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
consider is um the fact that yes people
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
can interpret the law differently but I
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
think that there's a real risk of this
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
particular statute being
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted um into um just a broad
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowance of exactly the kind of
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
behavior that I that I described um most
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
citizens don't write the laws um most
 
04:40:08.910 --> 04:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
citizens never read our laws what they
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
do is they hear about our laws um and um
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
I have a con I have a I think I have a
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern that there are going
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
to be people who
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
misinterpret this
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um and who think they have
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to something to do something
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't think the people who
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
drafted this law intend for them to do
 
04:40:32.830 --> 04:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that there's a real danger
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
here of unintended consequence and and I
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
really think that sometimes we do need
 
04:40:45.390 --> 04:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
legislators see seeing no further the
 
04:40:47.878 --> 04:40:51.190 align:start position:0%
legislators see seeing no further the
hands

04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
raised the matter will now be put the

04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
04:43:26.430 --> 04:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony today my name is
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
Amanda Balin and I represent Hillsboro
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
District 12 which is Manchester Ward
 
04:43:35.708 --> 04:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
five um in introducing House Bill 557 I
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify some terminology
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
close confinement solitary solitary
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
confinement um are all the same
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
generally um they represent the same
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
ideas um in our state facilities they
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
refer to it as C5 status but I
 
04:43:52.830 --> 04:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that um the commissioner of
 
04:43:55.390 --> 04:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections um might
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
testify today as to the difference
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
between C5 status and what you might
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
think solitary is based on um tell shows
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
things like that um so the intent of
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is to repeal Antiquated laws
 
04:44:13.230 --> 04:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
and to preserve the currently accepted
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
use of solitary confinement in our
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
facilities um basically bring an update
 
04:44:22.270 --> 04:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
to the law and put it in line with the
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
current practice in our
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
facilities the original law that created
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
the county prison system in the 1800s um
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
at the time it was only a County
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
facility I don't uh we didn't have a
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
state facility and in the um and it was
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s that the uh the rsas forked
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
and we sort of set up a separate uh
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
County system and a state system that
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
were run by different bodies and had um
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
eventually a very different set of laws
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
um dictating what goes on in those
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
facilities um so over time they were
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
recodified and in the last century and a
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
half the original
 
04:45:05.400 --> 04:45:06.708 align:start position:0%
half the original
[Music]

04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
um the original terminology has been
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
slowly peeled away by subsequent
 
04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislatures um and right now very
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
little remains of what was originally
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
the um the laws for the county
 
04:45:22.270 --> 04:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
facilities in the
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
1800s so for
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
example um the section of law that uh
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill repeals
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
originally said um in part if any any
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
prisoners are refractory and stubborn
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
and refuse to work or to perform their
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
work in a proper manner then the
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent may put them in close
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
confinement until they submit to perform
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
their task and obey his order and in the
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
case of great obstinacy and perverseness
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
may reduce them to bread and water till
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
they submit and Obey so in the 1800s
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
concepts of um criminal justice and
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
reform were a little different and you
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
can see that over time at a minimum if
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
you've if you've looked the RSA that
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
section two repeals then you would
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
observe that the at a minimum the
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
portion about only feeding prisoners
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
bread and water has been repealed since
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
then um and another now repealed section
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's completely gone from the law says
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
that if any prisoner shall abscond
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
Escape or depart a house of correction
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
without license um that they can be
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
restrained using Fetters or shackles um
 
04:46:34.590 --> 04:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
so a lot like the um the law against uh
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh adultery that was repealed by this
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
body um maybe four bium ago um New
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a lot of really outdated
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
laws on the books um the terminology
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
certainly outdated but so are the
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
policies um as members of the criminal
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
justice committee you've probably heard
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
before that the Quakers are believed to
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
have originated the concept of solitary
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
confinement um in the 1800s and I think
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
in the 1700s as well the Quakers hoped
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
that by giving someone Solitude and a
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
Bible and maybe a skylight they could
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
look to God uh look upward to God and
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
consider their their
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
sinfulness and um consider how they
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
might become better people and this
 
04:47:25.390 --> 04:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
method became popular because it was
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
considered it it became popular outside
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
of Quaker groups um in the nation in
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
general because it was considered to be
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
more Humane than public floggings or
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
hangings um at the time but eventually
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
the Quakers abandoned the practice when
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
they noticed that the people that they
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
were trying to reform so that they could
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
be productive members of the community
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
were coming out of their solitary
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
confinement violent and very different
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they um you know without access to
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
science and Concepts like that they they
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
in regardless began to question whether
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
their program was effective um and keep
 
04:48:04.270 --> 04:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
in mind when solitary confinement became
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
popular um popular as a a Humane
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
alternative to public floggings and
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
hangings these were people that were
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
only a couple Generations removed from
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
the SE and Witch Trials and this was
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
really before the birth of our nation um
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
that these were cuttingedge Technologies
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
for um enacting reform among prisoners
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh so this is certainly under a
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
different uh system of government um in
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
a different
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Society so so the thing about solitary
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
confinement is that because mental
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
health issues often already pre-exist in
 
04:48:42.990 --> 04:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
so many um offenders it can be really
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
hard to determine what mental health
 
04:48:49.110 --> 04:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
issues um an offender is experiencing
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
that predate imprisonment and predate
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement and which are the
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
result of the exposure to solitary
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
confinement but studies showed that the
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
majority of those who experien solitary
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
confinement end up reoffending and at a
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
higher rate than the overall population
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:49:08.190 --> 04:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
facility um there is an amendment that
 
04:49:10.510 --> 04:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
the committee should have
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
received on this bill and it was
 
04:49:15.190 --> 04:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
proposed by uh the commissioner of the
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections um in OS I
 
04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
guess both I and Os overlooked a portion
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we were striking in section one
 
04:49:26.670 --> 04:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
went a little heavy with the the Sharpie
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
there and um it turns out that section
 
04:49:33.628 --> 04:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
one in part gives the Department of
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
Correction the um authority to
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
discipline whatsoever and the intent of
 
04:49:39.310 --> 04:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is just to remove solitary
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
confinement as a method of discipline um
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a variety of other ways to
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
discipline an inmate and um as it turns
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
out the State Department of Corrections
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
is not using solitary confinement to
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
discipline inmates they do use solitary
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
confinement but for reasons other than
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
discipline um so if someone is a safety
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
risk um they're they're at risk of
 
04:50:01.390 --> 04:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
harming others or maybe others are at
 
04:50:04.548 --> 04:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
risk of are likely to harm them um there
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
may be health issues uh the current
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic certainly an example of how
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
isolation can prevent the spread of
 
04:50:14.548 --> 04:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
disease um so there's a lot of reasons
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
why solitary confinement has benefits in
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh Correctional institution and probably
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
in life in general um but as a form of
 
04:50:26.910 --> 04:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
punishment it's not um a regular
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
practice anymore and it's not considered
 
04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate um but I look forward to
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the commissioner's uh testimony
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
in that regard because I know that she's
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
um if she does plan on testifying um I
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
know that she's obviously the authority
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
on the system that is used in the
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
facility to determine who's given
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement and for what reason
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
and uh how that decision's arrived at um
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
also there's a misunderstanding that I'd
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
like to address which is the belief that
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
section two would repeal the ability for
 
04:50:59.230 --> 04:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
the County facility to discipline in any
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
manner um this is not the unfortunately
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
because section two is a straight repeal
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't print the language in the law
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
um but you can uh look it up online if
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
you like um but section two is not what
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
gives County facilities the authority to
 
04:51:18.190 --> 04:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
discipline in fact section two very
 
04:51:20.708 --> 04:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
specifically gives the county
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
authorities the authority to
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
discipline when a prisoner refuses to
 
04:51:30.030 --> 04:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
work so for example in the cafeteria in
 
04:51:32.430 --> 04:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
the laundry Center um if a prisoner
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
refuses to work then uh section two
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
repeals the authority to give them
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement as a method of
 
04:51:44.190 --> 04:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
discipline in that situation and that's
 
04:51:47.070 --> 04:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
one of the laws going back to the 1800s
 
04:51:49.150 --> 04:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
when typically next to the jail you'd
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
find a field maybe they'd be building
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
things um maybe their labor would be
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
farmed out to nearby businesses as a way
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
of um paying back their debt to society
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
and that's not something that's really
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
going on anymore in
 
04:52:07.510 --> 04:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
facilities and um the county facilities
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
have by Statute Ru making Authority
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
where they can um they can determine how
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
they will discipline inmates and uh in
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
in essence section two repeals a sort of
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
like appendix um it's a section of law
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's not being used anymore it's not
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
necessary it doesn't really have a
 
04:52:28.830 --> 04:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
purpose and we've already found
 
04:52:31.270 --> 04:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
workarounds where we've written new laws
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
since then that enable the count
 
04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
facilities to handle issues like this um
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
in other ways and additionally um
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
because section to repeals the County's
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
authority to punish people who refuse to
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
work you can see that this isn't the the
 
04:52:52.548 --> 04:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
section of law that gives the counties
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
the authority to discipline whatsoever
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would never be able to
 
04:52:58.310 --> 04:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
discipline people for violence or
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
attempting to escape because that's not
 
04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
delineated in the RSA that's repealed in
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
section two
 
04:53:05.548 --> 04:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
um so there's a lot of different ways
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
that someone could be disagreeable or
 
04:53:09.548 --> 04:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
hard to work with when they're
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um aside from just refusing
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
laundry and um because the uh the RSA in
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
section two was written in the 1800s and
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
times have changed and so much has
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
changed in the way that we really do
 
04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
corrections in on this planet um it's
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
just outdated the terminology doesn't
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
work it doesn't fit into their program
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
anymore um so I think that that's all
 
04:53:38.510 --> 04:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
that I really wanted to communicate to
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the committee I really encourage you to
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
look up the RSA that's repealed in
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
section two to get clarification on the
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
um archaic and outdated and unnecessary
 
04:53:55.948 --> 04:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
question has a question thank you Mr
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank the member for taking my
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
question I actually have three questions
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
but I'll start with the first one which
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
is that I do not see an amendment and I
 
04:54:15.628 --> 04:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
know that I'm substituting on the
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
committee but um you had mentioned an
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
amendment which I assume would unstrip
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
the words and may punish and convict
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
guilty insolence or ill language to any
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
officer of the prisons or guilty uh of
 
04:54:31.230 --> 04:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
obstinate and refractory Behavior period
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
giving them the ability to punish but
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
take taking out the method of punishment
 
04:54:37.830 --> 04:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that amendment in my
 
04:54:39.430 --> 04:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
packet and I'm just I took everything
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
that was available and I don't see it so
 
04:54:42.510 --> 04:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm was wondering if that actually got
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
drafted and is available to people today
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
and was going to be offered today or if
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's an
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
oversight the um thank you for the
 
04:54:54.190 --> 04:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
question in our committee the committee
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
assistant emails out amendments to the
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
list of committee members and I'm
 
04:55:00.510 --> 04:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that I don't know how recently
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
you were assigned to be a sub today but
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that um when that went out
 
04:55:07.150 --> 04:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
you weren't copied but I'd be happy to
 
04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
send it to you in um whenever we're done
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
talking um I suppose whenever I'm done
 
04:55:14.670 --> 04:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
answering questions I can forward that
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
to you because I can't do that many
 
04:55:18.910 --> 04:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
things with my brain at once um but the
 
04:55:22.590 --> 04:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
amendment language was drafted by the
 
04:55:24.510 --> 04:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the State Department of
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
Corrections um so I so that way we can
 
04:55:28.830 --> 04:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
have confidence that it fits in with um
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
what they're doing at their
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
facility thank you followups
 
04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
have a followup question um does this in
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
any way
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
impede the Department of Corrections
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
either at the county level or the state
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
level from using solitary confinement to
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.030 --> 04:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
prisoner I think I opened a program on
 
04:55:55.470 --> 04:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
my computer by accident um no it thank
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
you for the question it does not impede
 
04:55:59.788 --> 04:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
um the use of solitary for other
 
04:56:03.070 --> 04:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
purposes and that kind of goes back to a
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
lot lot of the rules that we have in
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
place dictating how our County and state
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
and prison facilities are run um is is
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
mostly administrative rules that go
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
through um Jael car for example and
 
04:56:18.270 --> 04:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
they're not really in the rsas anymore
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what makes this set
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
of rsas Stand Out is that they speak to
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
really specific
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
situations um specific problems with
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
specific um uh really controlled ways of
 
04:56:32.470 --> 04:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
addressing them um and that doesn't fit
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
into the overall scheme of how we're
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
operating these Correctional
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
institutions anymore I hope that that
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
makes sense does and one final follow up
 
04:56:44.708 --> 04:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
question the last one that I had was uh
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
in the repeal of section
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
toly at the county level would this
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
actually repeal them from being able to
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
punish in any way for refusing to work
 
04:57:01.948 --> 04:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
or is this only taking the option of
 
04:57:04.548 --> 04:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement the list of options
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have for refusing to work because I
 
04:57:09.868 --> 04:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
know that I still see the prisoners out
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
collecting trash on the side of the
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
working I thanks for the question you
 
04:57:18.270 --> 04:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
broke up a little at the beginning I'm
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that's my connection um but I
 
04:57:23.790 --> 04:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
think that I understood your question
 
04:57:23.800 --> 04:57:25.110 align:start position:0%
think that I understood your question
[Music]

04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
um a different RSA in the same uh
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
section of law gives the county
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
facilities um Ru making Authority
 
04:57:36.990 --> 04:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
through the Commissioners and they're
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
free to set rules for their facilities
 
04:57:42.510 --> 04:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
um as to how they want to discipline
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
inmates so I hope that that clarifies
 
04:57:46.510 --> 04:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
like this that's what really makes this
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
sort of like the appendix is you're
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
muted you're muted question
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
repres yes why did I
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
mute my other question
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
that's right it should stay muted um my
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
other my other part of the question that
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
you missed when I asked it was does this
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
actually take away from their ability to
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
punish or not want them to work or
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
refusing to work I don't care about all
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
the other ways they can punish people
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
for other things they do wrong I don't
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
want to take away the ability for the
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
counties to punish people who refuse to
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
work on work detail because we do still
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
send people out on work details um and
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
they should be able to be punished for
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.510 --> 04:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
there a question there yes I'm asking
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
does this remove the ability to punish
 
04:58:41.600 --> 04:58:44.110 align:start position:0%
does this remove the ability to punish
at

04:58:44.110 --> 04:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
all thanks for the question the answer
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
is no um I hope that that the way that
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm phrasing my answer makes sense but
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
no this does not remove that
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
Authority thank
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions from the
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
committee Mr
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Wallace thank you Mr chairman
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um will
 
04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
this eliminate the practice of close to
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
term thank you for the question I'm a
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
little confused can you um you said the
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
the practice or just the term are you
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
asking me if I'm cleaning up vocabulary
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
in the rsas is that what you're asking
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman well
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward um looking
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the amendment and looking at the
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
original bill um and based on what you
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
said it's unclear to me if this is just
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate the term close or
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement and by your
 
04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
testimony you said it would still be
 
04:59:49.948 --> 04:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
able to be used for the purpose of
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
protecting an inmate so the question
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
remains will this eliminate the practice
 
04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
of close to solitary confinement for
 
04:59:57.670 --> 04:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
just the
 
05:00:00.030 --> 05:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
terminology um thanks for the question I
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
think my answer is that it does not
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate terminology and it does not
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate the practice so neither um
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
because I think there's just a
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the bill in
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
general the bill does not eliminate the
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
practice of solitary confinement it
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates um it repeals language and
 
05:00:18.750 --> 05:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
rewrites language that in the 1800s gave
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
um superintendents and um and leader uh
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
people running uh Correctional
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
institutions uh the authority
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
to um confine people who refuse to work
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
or to use solitary confinement as a form
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
of punishment in uh for other activities
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
and um as I said earlier the Department
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
of Corrections is not using and when I
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
say the Department of Corrections I'm
 
05:00:48.548 --> 05:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
referring to the state facility and then
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
when I say the um the County facility
 
05:00:53.708 --> 05:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to the counties so um the
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections um at the
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
state level does not use solitary
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
confinement as a punishment they use
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement for protection for
 
05:01:04.990 --> 05:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
Health um to limit the movement of a
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
prisoner who's likely to be violent or
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
um cause other problems in the facility
 
05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
that warrant uh confinement um they have
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
a system that I hope when the
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh speaks she's asked um
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
about the grading system but they have a
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
a very thorough grading system set out
 
05:01:27.070 --> 05:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
in in rules that were approved through
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
Jael car to determine when um an inmate
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
should be confined and um as I
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
understand it multiple staff members are
 
05:01:41.110 --> 05:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
required to um uh evaluate the prisoner
 
05:01:43.230 --> 05:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
separately U so that the system can't be
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
gamed and there can't be someone um to
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
like prevent someone from who maybe has
 
05:01:49.628 --> 05:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
a personal problem with an inmate uh to
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
prevent them
 
05:01:54.548 --> 05:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
from uh sending someone to solitary as a
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
punishment when they they just maybe
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
have a personal problem with them so
 
05:02:01.110 --> 05:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
multiple people need to be involved in
 
05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
evaluating The Prisoner there um a
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
grading system this the prisoners given
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
certain ratings on certain um on certain
 
05:02:12.548 --> 05:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
fronts um for example their propensity
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
for violence things like that the also
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
was taken into consideration is the
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
reason that they were incarcerated in
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
the first place uh the severity of that
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
crime and those are the criteria that
 
05:02:26.590 --> 05:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
are used to determine who goes to
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
solitary and none of the criteria are if
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
they need to be punished for something
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
um so the Department of Corrections is
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
not using uh the is not taking advantage
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
of what current law allows them to do
 
05:02:44.548 --> 05:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons behind um
 
05:02:44.558 --> 05:02:45.670 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons behind um
a

05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
and if I might ask representative what
 
05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh thanks for the question I was
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about that today and I couldn't
 
05:03:02.440 --> 05:03:03.350 align:start position:0%
thinking about that today and I couldn't
remember

05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
remember
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
um but commonly I'm uh searching for
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
something else on the Gen Court website
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then I stumble across a dumb old law
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm like wow this law is dumb and
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's old and uh we should repeal it and
 
05:03:19.310 --> 05:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
then come September I file a bill um and
 
05:03:19.320 --> 05:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
then come September I file a bill um and
that's

05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
usually that's usually how things go um
 
05:03:25.628 --> 05:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
if you look at if you look up the RSA
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
that's repealed in section two the uh
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
terminology is really entertaining
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I don't have it in front
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
front of me but um refractory stubborn
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
refuses to submit to work um these are
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know rules words from a different
 
05:03:43.948 --> 05:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
Society with different
 
05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
standards and um while there's certainly
 
05:03:48.190 --> 05:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
documents that were written a very long
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
time ago that are really important to us
 
05:03:50.750 --> 05:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
today and we want to preserve them and
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
continue to live by them um there's
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
obviously um rules that we like to get
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
rid of over time as we learned better
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
for example you know um in the time of
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
the saale and Witch Trials there was
 
05:04:04.830 --> 05:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of Concepts and beliefs
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
that people had back then that were not
 
05:04:09.070 --> 05:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
accurate lives were lost as a result of
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
these misunderstandings and it's always
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
Inc coming upon um a good Society to
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
evaluate the laws that has in place and
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
update them and um I'm hoping to follow
 
05:04:24.750 --> 05:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
in the footsteps of the the commissioner
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
in um updating uh the the existing laws
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
to reflect what's actually going on in
 
05:04:29.638 --> 05:04:31.548 align:start position:0%
to reflect what's actually going on in
our

05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:34.788 align:start position:0%
our
facilities

05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
me a question yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:04:40.430 --> 05:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative for taking
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
my question um the uh in the uh
 
05:04:49.948 --> 05:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment there is a um a line that says
 
05:04:51.788 --> 05:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
uh that the commissioner may use
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate Correctional best practices
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in responding to VI violent Behavior es
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
Escape threats rioting and behavior that
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
adversely affect safety security or
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
facility operations are those best
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
practices going to be part of the uh rul
 
05:05:07.878 --> 05:05:09.670 align:start position:0%
practices going to be part of the uh rul
making

05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
process uh thanks for the question I
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe that they already are and that's
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that that the commissioner
 
05:05:17.948 --> 05:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
looked at this uh bill as an opportunity
 
05:05:21.310 --> 05:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
to update existing law um to cover
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
things that probably weren't considered
 
05:05:25.548 --> 05:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
either weren't considered in the 1800s
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
or were delineated in areas of law that
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
have since been repealed I know that um
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
when this little snippet on
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
um solitary if you refuse to work was
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
put into place um there was also that
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about um if you're really
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
fussy we'll only feed you bread and
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
water and then there was also at the
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
time another section of law that dealt
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
with um how to handle people who try to
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
escape what happens to them once they're
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
captured um who's to pay for the
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to find them and all
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
of that's been repealed since then um so
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
that that is covered in other areas of
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
law now and it's just I mean in their
 
05:06:06.270 --> 05:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
rule making um process and it's just
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to update the law to reflect
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
that okay uh so followup I just I just
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
want to make Absol absolutely clear that
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
the that what what's going to be going
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
into statute is pretty pretty General
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
there's going to be very much something
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
much more specific in the
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
rules there is yeah thank thank

Hanks the commissioner of the Department

of Corrections for the record I am in my
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
office with the door closed alone I
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank representative Balden for bringing
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation forward you'll
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
see me signed in opposed my opposition
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
was to the original Bill not to the
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment as we did work
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively on trying to provide
 
05:07:34.868 --> 05:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
some current language representative of
 
05:07:38.110 --> 05:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and I
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the adjustment because we are
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
a rehabilitative organization and we
 
05:07:44.670 --> 05:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
should be using appropriate Correctional
 
05:07:46.590 --> 05:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
best practices and to representative
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
bixby's comment we want to be careful
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
not to
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
overprescribed in law and not be able to
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
grow as a state department of
 
05:07:57.150 --> 05:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
corrections as those practices adjust
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
but if you if you do the research when
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
you do the research I know you will as
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
you are likely have done before today uh
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
you'll find things like the Department
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
of Justice published guidelines on the
 
05:08:10.590 --> 05:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
use of uh restrictive housing so the
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
term solitary confinement we don't use
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
that term in state corrections you'll
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
see in my testimony has submitted at the
 
05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
beginning of this week or it could have
 
05:08:20.350 --> 05:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
been last week I do lose track of time
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
at the pace in which we work here in the
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that we Chang
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
significantly as far back as 2005 with
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
regard to our practices as a result of
 
05:08:31.230 --> 05:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
very appropriate cases brought forward
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
and those practices have have not
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
changed um in fact when you when you go
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
to sites such as the national Commission
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
on Correctional healthc care American
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections Association when they Define
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
those practices it's 22 hours or more
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
locked in a Cell we haven't engaged in
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
that practice in more than a decade and
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
and nor should any Correctional agency
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
do so in the future um those
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
classification rules as represented
 
05:08:59.708 --> 05:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
Balden reference those are available all
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
under the correctional rules chapter 400
 
05:09:05.350 --> 05:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
talk about how we analyze and assess
 
05:09:08.430 --> 05:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
individuals um with regard to the
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
section of law here uh discipline when
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bolan and I first
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this I had not realized that I
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
had agreed to striking all my authority
 
05:09:18.270 --> 05:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
to engage in discipline so I want to
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate her publicly for allowing me
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure we maintain safe
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
Correctional institutions for the men
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
and women incarcerated in the state of
 
05:09:26.160 --> 05:09:26.910 align:start position:0%
and women incarcerated in the state of
New

05:09:26.910 --> 05:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:09:29.548 --> 05:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I would also point you to
 
05:09:33.548 --> 05:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
RSA 21 h13 rul making it described all
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
the rul making requirements of the state
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
agency and we have been updating those
 
05:09:40.708 --> 05:09:40.718 align:start position:0%
rules and moving them forward both at
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
the beest of this committee and other
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
members of the department and
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
constituent groups um you'll find that
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
in section 21 h14 however we've asked to
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
make and you have maintained this uh
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
privilege under law that the behavior of
 
05:09:58.350 --> 05:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
and it's the term in law inmates is not
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed in rule writing and I just
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
want to point out to you for example the
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
agency has to be nimble in response to
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the activities within the agency and to
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
try to engage in rule writing to predict
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior would be a significant
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
challenge most recent example is we have
 
05:10:16.510 --> 05:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are remitting letters on
 
05:10:18.750 --> 05:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
K2 soaked paper I would not have
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
predicted that six months ago so we have
 
05:10:23.708 --> 05:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
to engage in behavior and discipline
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
standards for that type of activity it's
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
both adverse to our residents and
 
05:10:29.948 --> 05:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
obviously the introduction of
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
contrabands such as substance substance
 
05:10:35.310 --> 05:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
es of abuse create for um inappropriate
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
environments with people under the use
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
of those elicit substan substances so
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm careful that the discipline rendered
 
05:10:44.430 --> 05:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
should be rehabilitative in nature the
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
behavior needs to be the behavior
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines which are published internal
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and certainly available to
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
the public are available and people
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
understands understand what those
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
standards are so we're

resources uh and the access um that I
 
05:15:12.910 --> 05:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
the incredible access to these resources
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:32:23.548 --> 05:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
you representative kly night will you be
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
123 um yes thank you chair you're now
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you um House Bill 123
 
05:32:42.190 --> 05:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
is um a repeat from last year it passed
 
05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
with consent 19 to
 
05:32:48.750 --> 05:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
zero um it was worked on by both
 
05:32:52.270 --> 05:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative Welch and representative
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh panelas last term and um there is
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
going to be an amendment introduced uh
 
05:33:04.190 --> 05:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
by by I hope hopefully by our chair um
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not sure if I should speak to
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
that or we should wait till exec session
 
05:33:12.190 --> 05:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to get that on your
 
05:33:17.390 --> 05:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
radar and that would make the bill um a
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
little stronger for victims that are
 
05:33:26.350 --> 05:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
um they they they shouldn't have to
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
prove that they're victims in that
 
05:33:31.110 --> 05:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
moment to receive Medical care so that's
 
05:33:35.708 --> 05:33:35.718 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does um and we had
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
for people that weren't in the committee
 
05:33:41.470 --> 05:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
last year really compelling stories of
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
women um not just women but um mostly
 
05:33:49.230 --> 05:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
from women being held basically prisoner
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
and being raped
 
05:33:53.310 --> 05:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly under the guys that they
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't leave and get themselves the
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
help that they needed um because that
 
05:34:02.070 --> 05:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
they were conducting in a form of a
 
05:34:06.230 --> 05:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
prostitution so it's used by harassers
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
um to keep their
 
05:34:12.190 --> 05:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
victims compliant and that means we get
 
05:34:15.548 --> 05:34:15.558 align:start position:0%
less reports for crimes on these issues
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
as well so uh I'll again um hopefully
 
05:34:23.830 --> 05:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
this this makes it pass this time and
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.878 --> 05:34:32.670 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:34:32.670 --> 05:34:32.680 align:start position:0%

for um thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
Comm for hearing my testimony again
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
today um on House Bill 546 so this is a
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill that came through this committee um
 
05:35:40.270 --> 05:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
before coid and it uh never made it
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
through the Senate because of the
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I believe it was voted 18
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
to2 um ought to pass um originally and
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
was on the consent calendar at the time
 
05:35:55.150 --> 05:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
and um for what it's worth the bill that
 
05:35:58.590 --> 05:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
was just heard was I believe unanimously
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed by this committee before coid and
 
05:36:03.788 --> 05:36:03.798 align:start position:0%
was on consent um both of the bills
 
05:36:06.350 --> 05:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
operate on the back of the
 
05:36:09.628 --> 05:36:09.638 align:start position:0%
same the concept that already exists in
 
05:36:12.990 --> 05:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law um I know that the
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
makeup of this committee has changed a
 
05:36:17.310 --> 05:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
lot but one thing that's stayed the same
 
05:36:19.030 --> 05:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
more or less over the years has been the
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
presence of uh representative John Bert
 
05:36:24.868 --> 05:36:24.878 align:start position:0%
and he would surely remember sitting
 
05:36:26.430 --> 05:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
through the
 
05:36:30.910 --> 05:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings on the 911
 
05:36:33.310 --> 05:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
immunity um law that we were trying to
 
05:36:37.390 --> 05:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
pass back then and I think the the
 
05:36:39.270 --> 05:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of the subcommittee was a
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislator who's not here anymore I
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
think um renie Cushing was on the
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and so was representative F
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
and the focus of that subcommittee was
 
05:36:52.830 --> 05:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
what to do with a proposal to give
 
05:36:55.628 --> 05:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
immunity to people um for the possess
 
05:36:58.350 --> 05:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
for the charge of drug possession if the
 
05:36:59.948 --> 05:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
evidence for that charge is found when
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
they report an overdose and something
 
05:37:05.868 --> 05:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
that um 911 Personnel were running into
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
at the time was bodies in snowbanks and
 
05:37:13.230 --> 05:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
bodies in alone in rooms with just a
 
05:37:14.910 --> 05:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license left and all the drug
 
05:37:16.868 --> 05:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia cleaned out and the
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
problem at the time was that um people
 
05:37:21.708 --> 05:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
would unfortunately when faced with the
 
05:37:24.510 --> 05:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
choice between um getting their their
 
05:37:26.310 --> 05:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
friend if you want to call it that
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
medical help when they're overdose
 
05:37:30.390 --> 05:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
overdosing or um saving themselves they
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
would save themselves more often than
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
not and um so
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately um when Governor Hassen um
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
was governor uh Senator hen was governor
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
um the a republican Le House and Senate
 
05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
passed a law to give immunity um for the
 
05:37:55.548 --> 05:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
charge of possession if the evidence is
 
05:37:58.030 --> 05:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
found when someone's calling 911 to
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
report an overdose
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
so there's it's a really well-written
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
area of Law and this bill just amends
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
that area of law to include um immunity
 
05:38:10.030 --> 05:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
from the charge of possession if you're
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
reporting a violent crime in general and
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
then the bill references a specific list
 
05:38:18.270 --> 05:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
of violent crimes um and uh so the way
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
that the existing law works is if you
 
05:38:21.910 --> 05:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
call the police and you say I'm
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
reporting an overdose and they show up
 
05:38:26.430 --> 05:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
and there's people tied up in your
 
05:38:28.270 --> 05:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
basement you're going to get in trouble
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
for that and if they show up and you
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
have a meth lab you're going to get in
 
05:38:33.070 --> 05:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
trouble for that but if they show up and
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
you have um such a small amount of drugs
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
on you or drug paraphernalia that it
 
05:38:39.468 --> 05:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
only qualifies for the charge of
 
05:38:40.990 --> 05:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
possession then you're not going to get
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
in trouble for that and the goal is to
 
05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
encourage with the existing law
 
05:38:47.548 --> 05:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
encourage people to communicate with
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
police and communicate with 911 and save
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
people's lives so that they have the
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to turn their lives around
 
05:38:56.030 --> 05:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
I've certainly met people who've been
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
who've gotten Naran five six seven times
 
05:39:01.548 --> 05:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
in their lives and they're now pastors
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
or youth leaders and they finally had
 
05:39:06.270 --> 05:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to turn their lives
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
around and the data um the the law that
 
05:39:12.590 --> 05:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
was originally passed had a sunset in it
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
and there was
 
05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
a GOP bill in um a subsequent year to
 
05:39:20.590 --> 05:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
repeal the sunset because data was
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
showing that the existing law was very
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
effective and encouraging people to call
 
05:39:28.750 --> 05:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
911 in the uh event of an overdose so
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
what I had in mind with this bill and
 
05:39:31.990 --> 05:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
what I communicated to the committee
 
05:39:33.750 --> 05:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
last year was that we should extend that
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
to people who are um either have been
 
05:39:38.670 --> 05:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
victimized themselves or may have
 
05:39:40.110 --> 05:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
information that they'd like to share
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
with police about a crime um because as
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
we know from at a minimum watching
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
gangster movies um that oftentimes in
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
certain um
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
communities there's it's less important
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
that someone's committed a crime and
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
more important that you maintain your
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
freedom from um you know jail or
 
05:40:02.670 --> 05:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
something like that and people are not
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
willing to communicate with police and
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's so many articles on the Union
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
Leader Manchester inklink and so forth
 
05:40:10.110 --> 05:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
where Manchester police that's where I
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
live are um complaining that there are
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
people showing up at the Elliott
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
hospital with stab wounds gunshot wounds
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
they won't talk they won't tell anyone
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
what happened and how are they supposed
 
05:40:21.868 --> 05:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
to address that these are real victims
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
of a crime there's someone who's
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
committed a crime who's walking around
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
free and it's because there's something
 
05:40:29.670 --> 05:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
going on in the victim's life life that
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
they're not willing to cooperate with
 
05:40:32.910 --> 05:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
police and for whatever reason they've
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
decided that they'd rather um that the
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
person who hurt them go free than have
 
05:40:40.510 --> 05:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
to interact with police because of
 
05:40:43.030 --> 05:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
whatever's going on
 
05:40:46.830 --> 05:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
and interestingly enough um we heard
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
this bill well your committee our
 
05:40:50.350 --> 05:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm on the committee now heard
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
this bill um January of 2020 before the
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
house really shut down over coid and um
 
05:41:00.430 --> 05:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
at the time you know I was proposing
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
this bill based on complaints that I'd
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
seen in the news where people weren't
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
cooperating with police and just that it
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
seemed common sense that if someone's
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
willing to cooperate with police to
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
report information about a bank robbery
 
05:41:13.150 --> 05:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
that they'd overheard someone bragging
 
05:41:14.430 --> 05:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
about or if they wanted to report that
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
they'd been assaulted or abused in some
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
way raped or something like that it just
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
seemed like common sense that someone um
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be arrested if the thing
 
05:41:25.390 --> 05:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
they're being arrested for is just
 
05:41:26.990 --> 05:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
really small and insignificant it
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve a victim um
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
but then interestingly enough uh it was
 
05:41:36.430 --> 05:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
probably like three or four weeks into
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
um like I guess what I would call Peak
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
coid you know sometime in March um we
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
came home from getting groceries which
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
we were only doing about every two weeks
 
05:41:49.628 --> 05:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
at the time and turned the corner near
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
our house and there were two men on the
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
side of the road in the grass fighting
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
and my husband uh I was the passenger my
 
05:41:59.548 --> 05:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
husband pulled over and started honking
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
like telling them stop it you know he's
 
05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
just reacting like what do we do but we
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
can't just drive past this you know this
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
isn't New York you you don't just drive
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
past something like that in New
 
05:42:10.510 --> 05:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um so he pulled over he's
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
honking he's yelling at them and we look
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
closer and the guy who was on top had a
 
05:42:19.150 --> 05:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
full champagne bottle in his hand and
 
05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
was beating the other guy in the face
 
05:42:23.310 --> 05:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
and there was blood everywhere it was
 
05:42:26.670 --> 05:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
horrifying and um let of you know me I'm
 
05:42:30.030 --> 05:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
a little nuts I got out of the car and
 
05:42:34.430 --> 05:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
the guy who's um on top with the
 
05:42:37.150 --> 05:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
champagne bottle leaves and we were in
 
05:42:40.110 --> 05:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
touch with 911 at the time and they said
 
05:42:42.190 --> 05:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
that they were coming and I'm saying to
 
05:42:44.468 --> 05:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
this guy who has blood all down his face
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
down his clothes all over the things
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
he's carrying I'm like please wait uh
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's an ambulance coming you probably
 
05:42:54.150 --> 05:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
need stitches he seemed to be in shock
 
05:42:56.548 --> 05:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
and he just walked away like into our
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in the direction we were
 
05:42:59.788 --> 05:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
going so I followed him
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I was like my husband's just going
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
to keep driving behind us he knows me
 
05:43:05.868 --> 05:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
he's not going to talk me out of this if
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
you're walking this way guess what we're
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to pass by my house we can get you
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
some paper towels and I was trying to
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
reason with him and I was like please
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
just wait for the ambulance um you might
 
05:43:16.110 --> 05:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a concussion you shouldn't go to
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
sleep if you have a concussion Etc and I
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
could tell based on how he was dressed
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the things he was carrying that he
 
05:43:25.230 --> 05:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
might not have a place to live um and he
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said to me I don't want to
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
talk to the police I don't want to
 
05:43:29.590 --> 05:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
interact with them
 
05:43:31.390 --> 05:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want the police around me I
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
don't want them in my life I'm not going
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
to talk to the cops you need to leave me
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
alone lady um and I refused and then uh
 
05:43:40.750 --> 05:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere along our long walk through my
 
05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um the police caught up to
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
us and eventually an ambulance and I um
 
05:43:48.990 --> 05:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
said to the police will you please um
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
don't give them a hard time because I
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
guess something's going on and you know
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
um he doesn't want to interact with you
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
and uh anyway later on because we were
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
Witnesses the police called me and and
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
asked me if I would uh give my statement
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
over the phone as to what happened so
 
05:44:06.628 --> 05:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
that they could pursue the person who
 
05:44:08.310 --> 05:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
was Vally caught and arrested for
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
assault and they told me that the person
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
who was um assaulted refused to
 
05:44:15.788 --> 05:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
cooperate um so I was the only person
 
05:44:17.230 --> 05:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
who could really speak to what had
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
happened that day aside from my husband
 
05:44:22.590 --> 05:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just funny how um you know I
 
05:44:24.190 --> 05:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
put in the bill and then a couple months
 
05:44:26.670 --> 05:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
later when Co had had already eaten the
 
05:44:28.670 --> 05:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
bill or the Senate you know um wasn't
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to take it up as they did with so
 
05:44:32.310 --> 05:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
many pieces of legislation last year
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's funny that I would walk right into
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
a situation and basically live out the
 
05:44:40.990 --> 05:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
concepts in this bill um so I'm happy to
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
take any questions about how it's worded
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the bill looks a little complex
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
but in a
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
reality it's just uh tapered onto um the
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
edges of the existing law that relate to
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
um calling in an overdose and the you
 
05:44:56.030 --> 05:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
know again the idea here is for someone
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to call in um information
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
they have about a burglary a robbery a
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
violent crime against another person um
 
05:45:04.510 --> 05:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
if they've been victimized for them to
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
be able to report that and feel
 
05:45:08.310 --> 05:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing so um so I think
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to share with the
 
05:45:13.468 --> 05:45:13.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony if you don't mind the
 
05:45:19.868 --> 05:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
chair would like inquire of a question
 
05:45:23.390 --> 05:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
on on the bill line six and then again
 
05:45:24.868 --> 05:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
on line
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
n it uses the the another
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
person so is this intended to apply when
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
someone themselves is a victim of a
 
05:45:36.958 --> 05:45:37.990 align:start position:0%
someone themselves is a victim of a
violent

05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
violent
 
05:45:41.230 --> 05:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
crime and they wish to report the crime
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
because if it says another person
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
05:45:46.750 --> 05:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
exclude individual call on their their
 
05:45:50.230 --> 05:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
own behalf when they are the
 
05:45:52.510 --> 05:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
victim thanks for the question so
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
section two um or Roman two refers to
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
another person and r R 3 refers to the
 
05:46:00.080 --> 05:46:01.150 align:start position:0%
another person and r R 3 refers to the
person

05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
reporting so Roman 3 um 17 line 17 in
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
good faith in a timely manner reports
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
that he or she has been a victim of a
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
violent crime or is the victim in a good
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
faith in timely report of a violent
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
crime so the ideas that the um the
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
caller and the subjects of the crime are
 
05:46:24.190 --> 05:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
covered the idea being that um you know
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
someone might be reporting a rape or an
 
05:46:27.948 --> 05:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
assault or something but they might also
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
be reporting
 
05:46:32.590 --> 05:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
um a theft and maybe the the victim of
 
05:46:34.670 --> 05:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
the theft isn't even present maybe you
 
05:46:36.750 --> 05:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
know someone uh breaks into my house and
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
steals something and uh then they brag
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
and someone else hears about it and then
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
that person would call in by themselves
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
so they would be personally covered um
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
but then
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
also um you know if someone's personally
 
05:46:50.750 --> 05:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
victimized and maybe there's also a
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
witness to that incident um then either
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
the person who's victimized or the
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
person who witnesses it could call in I
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
hope that
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies it does it did raise so but we
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
can talk about the rest on the executive
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%

some way with many of you on this
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm glad to see that this
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
has gone to a different level I
 
05:48:15.628 --> 05:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
regularly work with people doing syringe
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
exchange and in the recovery Community
 
05:48:20.270 --> 05:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
who have been victims of uh violent
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
crimes or or even sexual assaults and
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
have not reported these crimes I've
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
actually personally witnessed people
 
05:48:29.070 --> 05:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
being assaulted or sexually assaulted
 
05:48:30.270 --> 05:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
not witness sexual assault but witness
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
people being assaulted or um being the
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual assault and I've
 
05:48:35.468 --> 05:48:35.478 align:start position:0%
treated some of these people medically
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
in some of my training in the past um
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
none of them that I've met wanted to
 
05:48:41.868 --> 05:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
come forward and and file charges and
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
prosecute the people who had assaulted
 
05:48:46.350 --> 05:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
or sexually abuse them because of fear
 
05:48:49.110 --> 05:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
of uh retaliation for either drugs or
 
05:48:49.120 --> 05:48:50.390 align:start position:0%
of uh retaliation for either drugs or
prostitution

05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
prostitution
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly uh I it's it's also very
 
05:48:57.390 --> 05:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh clear that uh sex workers in general
 
05:48:59.788 --> 05:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
are very reluctant to forward as are all
 
05:49:01.390 --> 05:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual violence we know that
 
05:49:02.910 --> 05:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers of people who actually come
 
05:49:04.750 --> 05:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
forward and report sexual violence are
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
are dismally low it's in the the teens
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
in in many studies that you look at of
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
how many people actually report these
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
crimes and in in instances of people in
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
the sex work industry that's even lower
 
05:49:17.628 --> 05:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
I think we need these laws uh
 
05:49:19.468 --> 05:49:19.478 align:start position:0%
desperately to keep people safer and not
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
just protect people who are using drugs
 
05:49:22.990 --> 05:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
and sex workers but to protect other
 
05:49:25.708 --> 05:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
victims uh who may be victimized by
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
people who were not put in jail because
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
they victimized someone who just
 
05:49:30.468 --> 05:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
happened to be doing drugs or in sex
 
05:49:32.310 --> 05:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
work so this doesn't just protect them
 
05:49:34.110 --> 05:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
it protects society as a whole and I
 
05:49:36.070 --> 05:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
implore you to please pass both of these
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.030 --> 05:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
go it's the first time you made it up in
 
05:49:47.280 --> 05:49:48.450 align:start position:0%
go it's the first time you made it up in
two

05:49:48.450 --> 05:49:48.460 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:49:48.460 --> 05:49:50.190 align:start position:0%
two

05:49:53.110 --> 05:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
minutes representative uh representative
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'm speaking on House Bill
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
546 thank you for taking my question um
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
Do You Believe by introducing this kind
 
05:50:14.830 --> 05:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
of legislation you'll see a reduction in
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
crime um I don't know if I I mean I'd
 
05:50:19.948 --> 05:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
hope so but I I definitely think you'll
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
see uh an increase in reporting of
 
05:50:24.750 --> 05:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
crimes which could lead to to less
 
05:50:26.830 --> 05:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
crimes being perpetrated in the future I
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
think people are less likely to commit a
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
crime if they know that that victim is
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
not afraid to come forward so yes I do
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
think that will may be the case in many
 
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
followup repres night you recognized for
 
05:50:45.468 --> 05:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
a followup question thank you um do you
 
05:50:48.110 --> 05:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
think there's potential then
 
05:50:52.510 --> 05:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
for more data gathering on this
 
05:50:54.750 --> 05:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
subject oh absolutely I right now we
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
don't hear anything I mean even just
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
people who are not uh in the sex work
 
05:51:00.190 --> 05:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
field or using drugs don't come forward
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
in such high numbers we don't know about
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of these uh specifically sexual
 
05:51:06.990 --> 05:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
assaults um most people are are more
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
inclined to report an assault in simple
 
05:51:11.670 --> 05:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
assault or a battery assault and battery
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
if they're not involved in those those
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
areas but I think this will definitely
 
05:51:17.708 --> 05:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
increase um the the bring it to light
 
05:51:19.548 --> 05:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
light is the best disinfectant so people
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
being able to come forward definitely
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
will help solve some of the
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%

thank you so much good afternoon Mr
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
05:52:06.510 --> 05:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
name is Lynn chalette and I am the
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
05:52:09.628 --> 05:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
Violence and I'm here to speak in
 
05:52:14.430 --> 05:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 123 thank you for
 
05:52:14.440 --> 05:52:15.230 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 123 thank you for
this

05:52:15.230 --> 05:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity we fundamentally believe
 
05:52:19.708 --> 05:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
that the fear of being arrested should
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
never prohibit any victim from reporting
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
that they have been sexually assaulted
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and this protection should apply to
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
any rape victim including those who have
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
engaged in prostitution tion we
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
generally support this legislation
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
including the amendment that was
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
referenced by the sponsor in her opening
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
comments um and I'd like to touch um
 
05:52:38.990 --> 05:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
just for a few minutes on that specific
 
05:52:41.548 --> 05:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
language less than two minutes um the
 
05:52:43.468 --> 05:52:43.478 align:start position:0%
reason that we support this amendment is
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted currently violates
 
05:52:48.628 --> 05:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
the spirit and the letter of the law of
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
the federal violence against women act
 
05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
the violence against women act is a
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
federal statute that grants funding
 
05:52:57.310 --> 05:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
rights and protection to victims of
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual ual
 
05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
violence specifically when vow was
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
passed in 2005 it includes language that
 
05:53:07.868 --> 05:53:07.878 align:start position:0%
prohibits States from requiring victims
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
to participate in the criminal justice
 
05:53:11.310 --> 05:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
system or to cooperate with law
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement in order to be eligible to
 
05:53:14.910 --> 05:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
receive Medical Care and forensic
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
evidence collection so the Coalition
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
would support an amendment that removes
 
05:53:21.468 --> 05:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
two pieces of language in this bill
 
05:53:23.468 --> 05:53:23.478 align:start position:0%
first removing the requirement that
 
05:53:25.510 --> 05:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
provides that a victim must cooperate in
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
an investigation that's in the
 
05:53:30.030 --> 05:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and also in section 7
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
removing the language that requires a
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
victim to assist law enforcement to
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
identify the
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
perpetrator the goal of the violence
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
against women Act was to make sure that
 
05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
any person who's sexually assaulted is
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
able to get critical Medical Care
 
05:53:45.468 --> 05:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
screening and evidence collection
 
05:53:47.708 --> 05:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
victims face so many barriers when they
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
come forward to report a rape or to
 
05:53:52.270 --> 05:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
report domestic violence and it's
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
critical that this state legislation
 
05:53:56.110 --> 05:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
mirror the protections provided to
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
victims on the federal level to ensure
 
05:54:00.670 --> 05:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they have access to that care
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the opportunity to come
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
before you today um
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
and I bet that's my timer so thank you
 
05:54:10.990 --> 05:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
very much for for your support and
 
05:54:11.000 --> 05:54:15.830 align:start position:0%
very much for for your support and
consideration

05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
today I want to thank you again for your
 
05:54:20.548 --> 05:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
testimony representative true you
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:54:26.190 --> 05:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh
 
05:54:30.310 --> 05:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.350 --> 05:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
eight of the bill I don't understand it
 
05:54:37.548 --> 05:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
um victim seeking medical
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
treatment uh doesn't need to make a
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:46.948 --> 05:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement if somebody's going to a
 
05:54:49.868 --> 05:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
hospital in need of medical
 
05:54:52.190 --> 05:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
treatment aren't they going to get
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
medical treatment at the
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
hospital or is the is the doctor at the
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
hospital going to say must cooperate
 
05:55:01.390 --> 05:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement before I treat you
 
05:55:04.750 --> 05:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't understand that whole
 
05:55:07.150 --> 05:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
scenario right um thank you for your
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
question representative so the scenario
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about is if someone
 
05:55:13.708 --> 05:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
who is sexually assaulted comes forward
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
and in the process of receiving that
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
care tells the doctor or tells the nurse
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
or the sexual assault nurse examiner
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
that they were engaged in prostitution
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
when they were sexually assaulted we the
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is to make sure that
 
05:55:29.708 --> 05:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
that individual can still receive the
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
care and the evidence collection if they
 
05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
want it and that they won't be at risk
 
05:55:35.150 --> 05:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
of being arrested for engaging in
 
05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
prostitution because they reported a
 
05:55:39.070 --> 05:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
rape so the scenario you're describing
 
05:55:40.750 --> 05:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we want to prevent we
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that any evidence
 
05:55:44.830 --> 05:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's collected or any statement that a
 
05:55:46.590 --> 05:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
victim makes about engaging in
 
05:55:49.230 --> 05:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
prostitution is not used as evidence in
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
them seeing no further hands raised I
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for her
 
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
much at this time the chair recognizes
 
05:56:07.680 --> 05:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
much at this time the chair recognizes
Joseph

05:56:12.390 --> 05:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.430 --> 05:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
Eber good afternoon members of the
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Ebert it's
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
EBT I'm a captain with the New Hampshire
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
State Police I oversee the Investigative
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau so thank you very much
 
05:56:25.868 --> 05:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
for giving me the opportunity to speak
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
today um I want to say say that uh I
 
05:56:31.628 --> 05:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
will be speaking to
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
546 uh and 546 only and I I want to
 
05:56:40.030 --> 05:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
start by saying that we absolutely uh as
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
a division of State Police support the
 
05:56:43.990 --> 05:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
notion of of what's trying to be
 
05:56:46.270 --> 05:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished uh but as we reviewed this
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing I wanted to bring to the
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee is it does
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
not appear as though there is a
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
restriction on the amount of Narcotics
 
05:56:59.788 --> 05:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
that uh somebody could be um not
 
05:57:02.468 --> 05:57:02.478 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for so in other words I when
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
the bill was introduced there was
 
05:57:06.510 --> 05:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about a small amount of drugs
 
05:57:08.190 --> 05:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think everyone can understand why a
 
05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
small amount of drugs is uh is clearly
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
not outweighed by somebody's um Health
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
um and not that a large amount
 
05:57:18.430 --> 05:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily is but there with there no
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
being no top end on that uh that was uh
 
05:57:22.510 --> 05:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
something that we wanted to bring
 
05:57:25.070 --> 05:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee uh to at least
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh have a discussion point that perhaps
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
there should be some limitation on the
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
amount of Narcotics that you could be
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
forgiven for possession um in this given
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
scenario um so having said that thank
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity to uh to
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
address you today and I'm certainly
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions that you
 
05:57:42.080 --> 05:57:47.868 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions that you
may

05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:50.830 --> 05:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
have I want to thank you for your
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
05:57:56.030 --> 05:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:57:59.628 --> 05:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do do you have um
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
an amount in mind that you were thinking
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
about I don't ma'am um thank you for the
 
05:58:08.190 --> 05:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh the question I I don't I I simply
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring forward as a a point of
 
05:58:11.708 --> 05:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
discussion it's it's an incredibly
 
05:58:15.548 --> 05:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
difficult topic to um try and weigh out
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know the uh the value of reporting
 
05:58:21.548 --> 05:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
harm that has been done to somebody uh
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
and and giving somewhat of a free pass
 
05:58:27.070 --> 05:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
on a possession of some level of drugs
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that uh where that
 
05:58:32.990 --> 05:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
break even point is um or if it exists I
 
05:58:34.590 --> 05:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
I simply wanted to bring forward to the
 
05:58:37.708 --> 05:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh the committee for uh discussion that
 
05:58:40.110 --> 05:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
topic thank
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
you representative expain you recognize
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I thank you for
 
05:58:48.910 --> 05:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this is not uh
 
05:58:51.310 --> 05:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is not replacing the uh the
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
ACT we already passed that um gives
 
05:58:58.230 --> 05:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
somebody the ability to report a drug
 
05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
overdose with immunity um I would
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
imagine that we already addressed the
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
situation of a quantity in that act did
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
we not and um would there be no problem
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
modeling this after after
 
05:59:16.270 --> 05:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
that and Sir that may be a question that
 
05:59:18.190 --> 05:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
is best answered by the other members of
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
the committee I think it's a a valid
 
05:59:25.030 --> 05:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
point certainly um but again as a topic
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
of discussion Perhaps it is something
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
that was already meet it out through the
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
process of committee work before I'm not
 
05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
aware of what that committee work was on
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Klein night
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
05:59:49.628 --> 05:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
question thank you um thank you for
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I believe the
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor this is about HB 546 excuse me
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh I believe the sponsor representative
 
06:00:02.910 --> 06:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
Balden said that um there's certain
 
06:00:04.948 --> 06:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
limitations already in this bill and
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
that you know there's certain things
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
that you can go after someone for and I
 
06:00:11.468 --> 06:00:11.478 align:start position:0%
just want to know in your experience
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
when you go to someone that's really a
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
danger are more often than not aren't
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
there other crimes that you can find to
 
06:00:21.430 --> 06:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
go after them
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
for I so I answer both parts of your
 
06:00:28.030 --> 06:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
question um and perhaps representative B
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
I note uh that she did reference that I
 
06:00:33.670 --> 06:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
didn't when I looked at the bill itself
 
06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
it seemed to reference 318 B2 I looked
 
06:00:38.990 --> 06:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
up 318 B2 and it talked about possession
 
06:00:41.548 --> 06:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
and possession with intent so I I didn't
 
06:00:44.270 --> 06:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
see I I know that she had said a a small
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
amount and that's that's why I was
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
referencing um everyone can I think
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
everyone can understand a small amount
 
06:00:53.230 --> 06:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
of drugs is not nearly worth uh taking a
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
risk at somebody's Health um but I
 
06:00:57.230 --> 06:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
didn't see within that that bill where
 
06:01:00.868 --> 06:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
there was um a quantity that was
 
06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
regarded as being forgiven for lack of a
 
06:01:05.150 --> 06:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
better term so that may be somewhere
 
06:01:07.788 --> 06:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
else so and I apologize greatly if I if
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
I've missed that but I didn't see it
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
within the bill um and in terms of uh
 
06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
when we respond to a call and whether or
 
06:01:17.548 --> 06:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
not there is a um there could be another
 
06:01:20.270 --> 06:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
crime that could be charged um you know
 
06:01:22.750 --> 06:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
what I would say is you you it's been my
 
06:01:24.628 --> 06:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
experience that when I uh respond to
 
06:01:26.708 --> 06:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
calls or when I'm in the presence of
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
others who respond calls um we charge
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
people with the the crimes that they've
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
committed um and we aren't we aren't
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
there to to search for necessarily a
 
06:01:39.868 --> 06:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
just a crime uh to charge so I it is
 
06:01:44.110 --> 06:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
what you're presented with um at that
 
06:01:46.230 --> 06:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
time representative Klein now you have a
 
06:01:49.468 --> 06:01:49.478 align:start position:0%
followup question yeah I'm just I'm just
 
06:01:52.110 --> 06:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
trying to know what your rights are as
 
06:01:55.510 --> 06:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you so it's let just a
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
scenario you go in there some somebody
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
called 911
 
06:02:03.708 --> 06:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
and uh they have some possession on them
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
and you can't convict them for that and
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
you save the life but if you think
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
something else nefarious is going on in
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
this home when you look
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
around are you allowed to pursue a
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
warrant or another Avenue of of
 
06:02:25.230 --> 06:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
conviction for somebody that is a
 
06:02:27.548 --> 06:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
criminal yeah absolutely if there
 
06:02:30.030 --> 06:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause that exist as you enter a
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
dwelling to lead you to believe that a
 
06:02:33.430 --> 06:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
crime has been committed you can
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh apply for a warrant um I
 
06:02:38.468 --> 06:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
think what I was uh getting at was was
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
more uh if you were to uh walk into a
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
home and there was say uh 25 to 30 kilos
 
06:02:47.788 --> 06:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
of uh methamphetamine sitting in the the
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
home is there a provision within this
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill that says uh that then again I may
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
not be aware of and I apologize if I've
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
wasted the committee's time on that but
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
is there a provision Within this bill
 
06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
that says well at that level at 30 kilos
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
there uh there could be a criminal
 
06:03:05.708 --> 06:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
repercussion to this uh but but
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely once once you're uh on in a
 
06:03:11.708 --> 06:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
in a premisis and you're uh you know you
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
may see evidence of another crime you
 
06:03:15.310 --> 06:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
could certainly seek a warrant but I
 
06:03:17.510 --> 06:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
think that uh the from what I understand
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
from this bill I wouldn't be able to
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:26.280 --> 06:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
crime

06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
crime
 
06:03:30.510 --> 06:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative Spain you recognized
 
06:03:32.548 --> 06:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
06:03:35.390 --> 06:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
um in a a little bit of research uh I
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
think I found the answer to my question
 
06:03:38.750 --> 06:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
to you previously would you believe that
 
06:03:41.230 --> 06:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
there was a Supreme Court case State of
 
06:03:43.030 --> 06:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire versus Brian Eldridge that
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
was decided on February 19th 2020 in
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
which the court has decided that the
 
06:03:51.310 --> 06:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
immunity afforded by RSA 318b
 
06:03:55.590 --> 06:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
28b 2017 which is the drug immunity that
 
06:03:58.430 --> 06:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
this is modeled after the immunity did
 
06:04:01.510 --> 06:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
not extend to possession with intent to
 
06:04:04.070 --> 06:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
sell and that the Supreme Court has
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
already decided that the immunity covers
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
drug amounts that up are up to but not
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
including amounts that would be of that
 
06:04:15.468 --> 06:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
quantity to be considered intent to
 
06:04:18.110 --> 06:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
sell representative Spain I thank you
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
greatly for uh for finding that case uh
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
we were certainly not aware of that and
 
06:04:25.150 --> 06:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
that very much may answer the uh the
 
06:04:27.390 --> 06:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
concern that we had reference the
 
06:04:30.510 --> 06:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
quantity that could be available if if
 
06:04:32.030 --> 06:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
you need to know the name again it is
 
06:04:33.548 --> 06:04:33.558 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire versus Brian
 
06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
Eldridge and you could be free to look
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:48.110 --> 06:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
sir see oh representative Rose thank you
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
question I have a very good friend
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's in law enforcement and he was
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
giving me just you know some examples of
 
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
some some of the ways along the lines
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you're that you're addressing as
 
06:05:04.868 --> 06:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
far as you know possible limits instead
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
of it just
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
being I guess just unlimited um would
 
06:05:13.628 --> 06:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
you be able to give an example of maybe
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of what is meant
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
to be a good thing however when you go
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
into a home and you know there's just
 
06:05:23.310 --> 06:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
bad things happening pretty much
 
06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere and now as you just said that
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know you're only there for this
 
06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
particular reason you see all these
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
things and now your your hands are kind
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
of tied would you be able to give us
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
like an example of maybe what you could
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
see as an unattended consequence of of
 
06:05:38.510 --> 06:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
that or of this particular
 
06:05:41.590 --> 06:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill so I think where this bill only
 
06:05:44.548 --> 06:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
addresses the uh possession of a a
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
narcotic and as representative Spain is
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
U uh has mentioned uh it appears to be
 
06:05:52.628 --> 06:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
limited via the Supreme Court to only uh
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
simple possession I I wouldn't worry as
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
much uh representative rhods about being
 
06:05:59.948 --> 06:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
handcuffed by this particular Bill uh
 
06:06:02.110 --> 06:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
and the reason I say that is um because
 
06:06:05.390 --> 06:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
it is specific to narcotics and if I
 
06:06:07.190 --> 06:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
were to see evidence or any other law
 
06:06:08.590 --> 06:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer were to see evidence
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
of another crime that was being
 
06:06:12.390 --> 06:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
committed um they could either act on
 
06:06:15.030 --> 06:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
what is in plain view or they could uh
 
06:06:17.468 --> 06:06:17.478 align:start position:0%
certainly seek a warrant and further the
 
06:06:18.910 --> 06:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
investigation that
 
06:06:22.750 --> 06:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:22.760 --> 06:06:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:06:24.310 --> 06:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:06:27.030 --> 06:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
represent representative true thank you
 
06:06:28.590 --> 06:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you very much for
 
06:06:32.030 --> 06:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh if I just throw a
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
scenario at you so I can get my head
 
06:06:35.830 --> 06:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
around the
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
bill especially given what I've heard is
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
there may be a a court case saying it
 
06:06:44.948 --> 06:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
only involves simple
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
possession if it only involves simple
 
06:06:49.948 --> 06:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
possession then what what is this bill
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
doing somebody's been
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
hurt uh I've Got Drugs on me but just
 
06:06:59.830 --> 06:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:02.590 --> 06:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
drugs if I call the police cuz somebody
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
got hurt you're probably not going to
 
06:07:06.990 --> 06:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
put me up against the wall and search me
 
06:07:09.788 --> 06:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find the drugs on me
 
06:07:12.030 --> 06:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
anyway if I just got simple amounts for
 
06:07:12.040 --> 06:07:13.150 align:start position:0%
anyway if I just got simple amounts for
simple

06:07:13.150 --> 06:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:07:16.430 --> 06:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
possession so so what what does this
 
06:07:19.628 --> 06:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
what does what does the bill accomplish
 
06:07:23.788 --> 06:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
uh why wouldn't somebody call for simple
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
possession they wouldn't call if they've
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
got a whole bunch of drugs in their
 
06:07:31.708 --> 06:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
house and they'd be liable for that but
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
but for simple possession wouldn't a
 
06:07:36.830 --> 06:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
normal person go ahead and call police
 
06:07:38.628 --> 06:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
call on
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
ambulance well what I what I would say
 
06:07:43.150 --> 06:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
to that sir is sometimes um individuals
 
06:07:46.430 --> 06:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
who are
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
U ingesting narcotics don't don't make
 
06:07:52.468 --> 06:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
the clearest decisions um and I think
 
06:07:55.230 --> 06:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
that what this uh Bill if I understand
 
06:07:58.468 --> 06:07:58.478 align:start position:0%
the aim of the bill is um to ensure that
 
06:08:01.750 --> 06:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
people uh know that they're what
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%

hb123 and we oppose this bill um we
 
06:09:10.310 --> 06:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because it invites
 
06:09:10.320 --> 06:09:11.270 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because it invites
false

06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
false
 
06:09:13.628 --> 06:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
accusations um the bill creates an
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
actual statutory defense to the crime of
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
prostitution um it does not simply limit
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
the Gathering of evidence during a
 
06:09:23.030 --> 06:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
medical exam um the bill is structured
 
06:09:24.830 --> 06:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
in such a way that anytime a prostitute
 
06:09:26.910 --> 06:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
is arrested he or she can claim claimed
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
that they were sexually assaulted and
 
06:09:29.948 --> 06:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
charges can no longer be
 
06:09:34.510 --> 06:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
brought so um we request that this bill
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
be ited because it will invite false
 
06:09:40.708 --> 06:09:40.718 align:start position:0%
accusations have unjust consequences and
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
not actually help people who are working
 
06:09:54.030 --> 06:09:54.040 align:start position:0%

motion are you offering an amendment we
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
speak the amendment I'm offering the
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
06:12:31.468 --> 06:12:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.830 --> 06:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
this what the amendment does in this my
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it again it's 202-
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
070 is that if a cruit or a sex worker
 
06:12:46.990 --> 06:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
were to
 
06:12:47.000 --> 06:12:48.990 align:start position:0%
were to
report

06:12:48.990 --> 06:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:12:52.150 --> 06:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
a a violent crime to
 
06:12:55.750 --> 06:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
police that sex worker would be required
 
06:12:57.670 --> 06:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
to Cooper with the investigation they
 
06:13:00.468 --> 06:13:00.478 align:start position:0%
basically would not have a choice this
 
06:13:03.468 --> 06:13:03.478 align:start position:0%
this eliminates that requirement U I
 
06:13:05.788 --> 06:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
know when this bill was presented last
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
term that was a concern that I raised uh
 
06:13:10.670 --> 06:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
I know it was also brought to our
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
attention that that may also being
 
06:13:14.230 --> 06:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
conflict with federal
 
06:13:16.910 --> 06:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
law that conflict aside I didn't I still
 
06:13:18.948 --> 06:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that's a good policy
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
to compel someone before force a
 
06:13:23.430 --> 06:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
cooperate investigation and essentially
 
06:13:25.230 --> 06:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
they could under some circumstance they
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
could lose the option having immunity by
 
06:13:29.788 --> 06:13:29.798 align:start position:0%
failing to cooperate and I I I don't
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
feel that that's voluntary the idea is
 
06:13:33.708 --> 06:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
that the person's been a victim of a
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
violent crime regardless of you know
 
06:13:39.948 --> 06:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
lifestyle or any anything about that no
 
06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
one deserves to be a victim of violent
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
crime and uh and also being forced to
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the police compelled to testify uh to
 
06:13:51.548 --> 06:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
cooperate I don't believe is uh I
 
06:13:52.990 --> 06:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
understand the logic
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
of reports a crime to a police officer
 
06:13:59.030 --> 06:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
but law enforcement that is presuming
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
that person would cooperate that is not
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
always the case however this amendment
 
06:14:07.468 --> 06:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
would would would remove that remove
 
06:14:09.310 --> 06:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
that requirement with they cooperate but
 
06:14:11.150 --> 06:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
also apparently make it in compliance
 
06:14:11.160 --> 06:14:12.548 align:start position:0%
also apparently make it in compliance
with

06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
Federal representative B thank you Mr
 
06:14:16.160 --> 06:14:18.510 align:start position:0%
Federal representative B thank you Mr
chairman

06:14:18.510 --> 06:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm just wondering on what
 
06:14:27.830 --> 06:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
Miss Cooper said about if a
 
06:14:30.548 --> 06:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
prostitute ended up getting arrested he
 
06:14:33.430 --> 06:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
or she depending on who it is um could
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
say oh right and you know then the other
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
person is going to go up river is that a
 
06:14:49.270 --> 06:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:53.070 --> 06:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
so believe that goes the under so the
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill not the amendment but oh
 
06:14:58.390 --> 06:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's true my just to answer that I did
 
06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
have that in my notes uh so it is the
 
06:15:02.670 --> 06:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
intent of the general court to encourage
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
a victim of sexual assault to report
 
06:15:08.110 --> 06:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
such crimes so my understanding that
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
this in that scenario the the concern
 
06:15:13.708 --> 06:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
raised I be by the testimony was someone
 
06:15:15.590 --> 06:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
is arrested for solicitation
 
06:15:17.310 --> 06:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
prostitution and then all of a sudden
 
06:15:18.788 --> 06:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
they say well I was a victim of sexual
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
assault and they're using that as a
 
06:15:24.230 --> 06:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
shield in this what this law does is
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
that the sex workers report rep in the
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
crime so in order to invoke this they
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
would be have to report the crime and
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
therefore so they're already claiming
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they were a victim of sexual
 
06:15:37.750 --> 06:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
assault before they ever were in custody
 
06:15:39.430 --> 06:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
or arrested or anything that's my
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
understanding what the intent of this
 
06:15:43.110 --> 06:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
does but that's more the underly bill
 
06:15:45.430 --> 06:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
06:15:48.030 --> 06:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
the okay yeah we can discuss that for
 
06:15:50.310 --> 06:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
yes I'll talk about it on the bill I do
 
06:15:52.830 --> 06:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
apologize I forgot we're just on the
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
amendment representative cther Okay so
 
06:15:57.590 --> 06:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
you took out the piece here where it
 
06:15:59.788 --> 06:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
says an assisting law enforcement to
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
identify alleged perpetrator that was
 
06:16:04.510 --> 06:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
line 10 and 11 can you give me the
 
06:16:06.510 --> 06:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
rationale behind
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
that so there's two rationals one the
 
06:16:10.990 --> 06:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
heard is that there's a federal law
 
06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
apparently that does not permit the
 
06:16:18.150 --> 06:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that a victim of a violent
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
crime cooperate with law enforcement
 
06:16:24.590 --> 06:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
order to obtain medical treatment I hope
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm working that correctly I'm going off
 
06:16:25.840 --> 06:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
I'm working that correctly I'm going off
memory

06:16:27.430 --> 06:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
memory
 
06:16:29.390 --> 06:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's the that's that's the federal law
 
06:16:33.070 --> 06:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
issue that issue aside of what this law
 
06:16:35.948 --> 06:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
would require is that if if a sex worker
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
or who's the victim of the violent crime
 
06:16:39.788 --> 06:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
were to report that they've been a
 
06:16:41.150 --> 06:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
victim to law
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh they are then they
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
required to then cooperate with the
 
06:16:47.468 --> 06:16:47.478 align:start position:0%
entire investigation all the way through
 
06:16:48.910 --> 06:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
now that doesn't mean that they if
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're served with a summons to appear
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
in court that they can ignore the
 
06:16:55.510 --> 06:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
summons it just in order to claim the
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
immunity they shouldn't be required to
 
06:16:59.310 --> 06:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
continue to cooperate with law
 
06:17:03.548 --> 06:17:03.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh that's I may appear
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to report a crime can
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
not cooperate with the investigation but
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time should that person lose
 
06:17:15.750 --> 06:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
the immunity Claim by failing to
 
06:17:18.230 --> 06:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
cooperate no but I think that the person
 
06:17:22.270 --> 06:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
the peror you
 
06:17:27.310 --> 06:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
perpetrator excuse
 
06:17:29.830 --> 06:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
me listen I agree that they should but
 
06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying by making a requirement that
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
they do in order to to maintain their
 
06:17:36.628 --> 06:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
immunity to me it's no longer
 
06:17:38.910 --> 06:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary I mean now it's now they're
 
06:17:41.948 --> 06:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
doing it in exchange not being
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted the're the ones that called
 
06:17:45.788 --> 06:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
the first place this is just a requiring
 
06:17:48.750 --> 06:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
to do that but I I do believe that and I
 
06:17:50.948 --> 06:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
I was opposed to that provision before I
 
06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
realized it federal law
 
06:17:58.270 --> 06:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
so it kind of it's on both grounds that
 
06:18:03.590 --> 06:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:06.030 --> 06:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
that but I hope I hope if someone does
 
06:18:08.430 --> 06:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
report that they do
 
06:18:11.150 --> 06:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
cooperate represent expain thank you Mr
 
06:18:13.468 --> 06:18:13.478 align:start position:0%
chair if I could I'd like to maybe throw
 
06:18:15.510 --> 06:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
out a scenario that I've been thinking
 
06:18:17.350 --> 06:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
of here that might explain why they
 
06:18:18.990 --> 06:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
might not want to identify the the
 
06:18:20.590 --> 06:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrator after they've reported the
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
crime um would you agree that this
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it now um
 
06:18:28.990 --> 06:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
Freer for the person who reports the
 
06:18:32.468 --> 06:18:32.478 align:start position:0%
crime to say report the crime and then
 
06:18:34.670 --> 06:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
at some point after they've reported the
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
crime and they've got their immunity
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
realized that the person that they got
 
06:18:41.190 --> 06:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
assaulted by had connections to say the
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
Whitey buer family and that their life
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
was in extreme danger if they were to
 
06:18:47.430 --> 06:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
continue with the identification and
 
06:18:49.150 --> 06:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
they might become afraid and not want to
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
report it and this would then allow them
 
06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
to say you know I've made my report but
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go any fur further and
 
06:19:00.830 --> 06:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
immunity it it would it would extend to
 
06:19:06.788 --> 06:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
that that scenario and and
 
06:19:09.868 --> 06:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
that that's a great example but at the
 
06:19:12.190 --> 06:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
same time even much lesser examples it's
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
just out of whatever fear that they may
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
have I believe it's an option that they
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't they not requireed again that
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the police can't summons
 
06:19:25.270 --> 06:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
them as a witness and if that person
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear the trial the case is not
 
06:19:30.030 --> 06:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to go anywhere compation Clause
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be require the charge to be
 
06:19:35.788 --> 06:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
dropped represent
 
06:19:38.430 --> 06:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
TR thank you Mr
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
fog so I I'll make up the scenario
 
06:19:51.310 --> 06:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
obviously a scenario type of
 
06:19:53.830 --> 06:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
guy a prostitute is working in the
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
streets and she sees two beat cops
 
06:19:59.230 --> 06:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
coming their way coming her way and
 
06:20:02.110 --> 06:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
she's obviously working and she says
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank goodness you're here officer I was
 
06:20:08.230 --> 06:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
just sexually assaulted by who many of
 
06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
your business I was just sexually
 
06:20:12.110 --> 06:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
assaulted I don't want to do anything
 
06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
else to let you know that maybe I should
 
06:20:18.150 --> 06:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.430 --> 06:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
hospital she's not going to be arrested
 
06:20:20.440 --> 06:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
hospital she's not going to be arrested
for

06:20:21.750 --> 06:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
prostitution she doesn't have to say who
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
assaulted her
 
06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
and she gets the medical attention she
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
she may or may not need
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
but she gets away with the
 
06:20:41.030 --> 06:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
crime by following this law two
 
06:20:44.350 --> 06:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
things to the point that you're making
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
that again relates to the underly bill
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
not the amendment so I I guess what my
 
06:20:52.230 --> 06:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
point is I can address that now maybe we
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
we vote on the amendment if the
 
06:20:57.070 --> 06:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that point would
 
06:20:59.110 --> 06:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
apply whether the amendment is adopted
 
06:21:02.948 --> 06:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
or not the underly law but the just
 
06:21:04.270 --> 06:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
because someone has immunity does not
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
mean they can never be prosecuted law
 
06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement is able to gather evidence
 
06:21:10.270 --> 06:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
independently of the person reporting
 
06:21:13.030 --> 06:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
the crime they could still arrest and
 
06:21:15.230 --> 06:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
prosecute that person they just won't be
 
06:21:17.708 --> 06:21:17.718 align:start position:0%
able to use the evidence they obtain by
 
06:21:19.708 --> 06:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
the sex worker
 
06:21:22.830 --> 06:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
reporting the sexual assault to law
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement so the scenario you're
 
06:21:26.350 --> 06:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
saying where they're you know a sex work
 
06:21:27.948 --> 06:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
is standing outside and two officers
 
06:21:31.110 --> 06:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
walk up if they had independent evidence
 
06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
that whether surveillance whatever they
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
claim try to get Immunity on this or
 
06:21:40.708 --> 06:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
not I don't believe would protect them
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
from being able to they still could be
 
06:21:45.150 --> 06:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
arrested because the evidence was obtain
 
06:21:45.160 --> 06:21:47.350 align:start position:0%
arrested because the evidence was obtain
independent

06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
independent
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
evence but again that's the underlying
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
Bill even with the with or without the
 
06:21:52.558 --> 06:21:54.548 align:start position:0%
Bill even with the with or without the
amendment

06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:21:54.558 --> 06:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
amendment
so

06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that more maybe after to
 
06:22:00.310 --> 06:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
we vot on the amend representative
 
06:22:03.030 --> 06:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
represent true so so the the amendment
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
itself says cooperation is not
 
06:22:07.600 --> 06:22:11.708 align:start position:0%
itself says cooperation is not
required

06:22:11.708 --> 06:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
bden thank you Mr chairman I understand
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
that um there's some debate over whether
 
06:22:23.708 --> 06:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
we can discuss the rest of the bill when
 
06:22:27.070 --> 06:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
discussing um the amendment um and I and
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
I hope that it's okay to debate the
 
06:22:34.030 --> 06:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
amendment by referencing the rest of the
 
06:22:37.350 --> 06:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill um and to expand on what you were
 
06:22:39.510 --> 06:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
saying um and this isn't my bill and I
 
06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
didn't co-sponsor but I feel like I
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
understand the terminology it says on
 
06:22:44.878 --> 06:22:47.150 align:start position:0%
understand the terminology it says on
line

06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
06:22:51.390 --> 06:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
14 um shall not be arrested prosecuted
 
06:22:53.350 --> 06:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
or convicted for a violation of this
 
06:22:56.990 --> 06:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
section line 15 if the evidence for the
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
charge was gained as approximate result
 
06:23:02.070 --> 06:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the person's reporting and it's my
 
06:23:05.150 --> 06:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that the way that this
 
06:23:08.110 --> 06:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
terminology has historically been used
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire law proximate meaning
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
like um direct result so the evidence of
 
06:23:19.390 --> 06:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
prostitution would have to be acquired
 
06:23:23.430 --> 06:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
after the uh sex worker what have you
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
has already contacted police to report
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
the um sexual assault so I don't know if
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
that addresses uh representative TRS
 
06:23:37.830 --> 06:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
concerns but the way that lines 14 and
 
06:23:42.350 --> 06:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
15 Read to me is that the com the
 
06:23:46.190 --> 06:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
interaction between the sex worker and
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
police would have to begin as the sex
 
06:23:53.468 --> 06:23:53.478 align:start position:0%
worker reporting the crime and then the
 
06:23:55.030 --> 06:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
if during the course of that
 
06:23:55.040 --> 06:23:56.750 align:start position:0%
if during the course of that
conversation

06:23:56.750 --> 06:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:23:58.510 --> 06:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
the police conclude that there's
 
06:24:00.510 --> 06:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
evidence for a charge of
 
06:24:02.628 --> 06:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
prostitution they wouldn't be able to
 
06:24:05.310 --> 06:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
use that evidence to support that charge
 
06:24:06.910 --> 06:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
because they found the evidence during
 
06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
the conversation of reporting the sexual
 
06:24:11.390 --> 06:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
assault so like a real life example
 
06:24:14.110 --> 06:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
would be someone's doing what they're
 
06:24:15.868 --> 06:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
doing with their life and then something
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
goes wrong and the next day they work up
 
06:24:20.468 --> 06:24:20.478 align:start position:0%
the courage to walk down to the police
 
06:24:22.948 --> 06:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
department and make a report and they
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
sit down and have a conversation and
 
06:24:27.030 --> 06:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
make maybe the police ask well what
 
06:24:28.990 --> 06:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
happened that prompt that put put you in
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
the situation of being in a car with
 
06:24:34.708 --> 06:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
this man um and then maybe she would say
 
06:24:37.910 --> 06:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
well I was prostituting myself and
 
06:24:40.110 --> 06:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's the situation that I believe this
 
06:24:42.270 --> 06:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
bill and specifically lines 14 to 15 are
 
06:24:45.390 --> 06:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
intended to speak to is that when that
 
06:24:48.510 --> 06:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
evidence is found can you please just
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
although you are making an excellent
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
point to the underlying bill I will say
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
that that excellent point to the underly
 
06:24:57.390 --> 06:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bill and that will also be relevant to
 
06:24:59.230 --> 06:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
the bill whether the amendment is
 
06:25:01.468 --> 06:25:01.478 align:start position:0%
adopted or not which we will
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
discuss I don't believe that that was
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to the amendment which simply
 
06:25:10.868 --> 06:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
relates to whether the The Seer
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
reporting the sexual assault law
 
06:25:16.190 --> 06:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement must cooperate so maybe we
 
06:25:18.270 --> 06:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
move the question on the amendment if
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then we can discuss the underlying
 
06:25:22.310 --> 06:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
merits of the bill which I think in
 
06:25:23.670 --> 06:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
respect the members are having a healthy
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
discussion but which is it's not
 
06:25:27.150 --> 06:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily is relevant to the amendment
 
06:25:29.670 --> 06:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
so I seeing No Hands raised in regards
 
06:25:32.390 --> 06:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
06:25:36.590 --> 06:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
number 202-
 
06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%

06:25:55.390 --> 06:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
purpose seeing No Hands raised the m
 
06:25:57.270 --> 06:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
will now be put the
 
06:25:59.788 --> 06:25:59.798 align:start position:0%

06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
making thank you um well I think the
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
point I was building up to was about the
 
06:28:37.990 --> 06:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment but um the the bill let me
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure I have that open so again it's
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
not my bill I'm not a co-sponsor but I
 
06:28:45.430 --> 06:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
think I know what the words mean and uh
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the situation that I was talking
 
06:28:48.590 --> 06:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
about if somebody's sitting in front of
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
a police officer making a report they've
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
been the victim of a crime the police
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
officer taking the report report and the
 
06:28:58.030 --> 06:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
and it's revealed through the uh
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
conversation that the that the person
 
06:29:02.830 --> 06:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
making the report was engaging in
 
06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
prostitution um around the time that the
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh the crime happened or just the result
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
of the conversation um with the um
 
06:29:14.070 --> 06:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
officer when the report's being made
 
06:29:15.548 --> 06:29:15.558 align:start position:0%
then the officer would not be able to
 
06:29:17.750 --> 06:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
use that as evidence to support a charge
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
against the person making the report it
 
06:29:21.910 --> 06:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
seems pretty straightforward and so
 
06:29:24.190 --> 06:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
consequently if um now that the
 
06:29:26.190 --> 06:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
Amendments passed I suppose the effect
 
06:29:30.548 --> 06:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
would be that if somebody um gets scared
 
06:29:32.468 --> 06:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
uh like the uh representative earlier
 
06:29:35.070 --> 06:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
was saying Whitey bulger's friend was
 
06:29:36.990 --> 06:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
the was the as
 
06:29:40.990 --> 06:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
salent um and they are not comfortable
 
06:29:43.270 --> 06:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
continuing um it seems like they would
 
06:29:47.070 --> 06:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
enjoy the the immunity regardless um
 
06:29:49.468 --> 06:29:49.478 align:start position:0%
because the point is that they they had
 
06:29:51.150 --> 06:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
to reveal that they were engaged in
 
06:29:54.190 --> 06:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior to make the report and
 
06:29:57.270 --> 06:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
um it shouldn't be dependent upon uh
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
someone uh necessarily cooperating it's
 
06:30:02.150 --> 06:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
just the fact that they had to reveal
 
06:30:03.110 --> 06:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
that they were engaged in criminal
 
06:30:05.150 --> 06:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior to make the report about a a
 
06:30:06.910 --> 06:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
violation against
 
06:30:12.510 --> 06:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
you the matter is open for discussion if
 
06:30:18.910 --> 06:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
anyone representative Marson you
 
06:30:21.110 --> 06:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you Mr
 
06:30:23.750 --> 06:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I just have a question of the
 
06:30:26.510 --> 06:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
last person that testified who was a
 
06:30:29.548 --> 06:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
defense attorney and she was against
 
06:30:33.910 --> 06:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and I got the opinion that she
 
06:30:37.590 --> 06:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
thought that it could be
 
06:30:40.030 --> 06:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
manipulated I asked that question tning
 
06:30:42.150 --> 06:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
member here that might be able to answer
 
06:30:44.830 --> 06:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
that for me I understood that concern
 
06:30:47.990 --> 06:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative Berke and
 
06:30:50.388 --> 06:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
had the similar concern and the concern
 
06:30:52.628 --> 06:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
was is that basically anytime someone is
 
06:30:55.708 --> 06:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
arrested or charged with prosec
 
06:30:58.388 --> 06:30:58.398 align:start position:0%
try to invoke
 
06:30:58.398 --> 06:31:00.868 align:start position:0%
try to invoke
this

06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:31:02.910 --> 06:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
defense which I believe that's a
 
06:31:05.070 --> 06:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern but I believe in the
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
scenario in order this is a for this to
 
06:31:11.628 --> 06:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
apply the sex worker is the person has
 
06:31:15.468 --> 06:31:15.478 align:start position:0%
to contact law enforcement so in that
 
06:31:18.628 --> 06:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
case if if they contact law enforcement
 
06:31:20.350 --> 06:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
and report that they've been a victim of
 
06:31:23.670 --> 06:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
sexual assault at that point that person
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
cannot be charged with with prostitution
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe that I don't agree
 
06:31:30.590 --> 06:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
with with the testimony that that
 
06:31:32.910 --> 06:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
scenario will become a problem because
 
06:31:35.948 --> 06:31:35.958 align:start position:0%
they're reporting it represent TR had
 
06:31:35.958 --> 06:31:36.788 align:start position:0%
they're reporting it represent TR had
good

06:31:36.788 --> 06:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that what happens if two
 
06:31:41.830 --> 06:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
officers are approaching someone that's
 
06:31:44.830 --> 06:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
working as a sex work outside on on the
 
06:31:46.628 --> 06:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
street and they approach the person
 
06:31:48.190 --> 06:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
that's the difference there number one
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that that person did not contact is
 
06:31:54.070 --> 06:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
not contacting law enforcers to report
 
06:31:57.230 --> 06:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
that they were from sexual
 
06:31:59.190 --> 06:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
assault thank
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
you representative rhod thank you Mr
 
06:32:05.948 --> 06:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
chairman I think it's very important to
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
point out that anytime that you're
 
06:32:11.150 --> 06:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with a sexual assault reporting
 
06:32:12.468 --> 06:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
of a sexual
 
06:32:15.430 --> 06:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
assault unless you have actual video
 
06:32:18.510 --> 06:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of the
 
06:32:20.548 --> 06:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
assault it's it's really going to come
 
06:32:22.990 --> 06:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
down to what he said she said situation
 
06:32:25.510 --> 06:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
and in order for the person to actually
 
06:32:25.520 --> 06:32:26.708 align:start position:0%
and in order for the person to actually
be

06:32:26.708 --> 06:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:32:30.388 --> 06:32:30.398 align:start position:0%
charged you do have to
 
06:32:32.590 --> 06:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
have pretty
 
06:32:34.350 --> 06:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly you have to have like
 
06:32:37.270 --> 06:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming testimony to be able to
 
06:32:42.150 --> 06:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
prove your point so just to say as the
 
06:32:44.590 --> 06:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
cop goes by oh I was assaulted by this
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
person you know I I have to think that
 
06:32:49.030 --> 06:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:32:51.990 --> 06:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
officer is able to tell signs of
 
06:32:56.670 --> 06:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
distress or not or the V the valid
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
validity thank you my friend over here
 
06:33:02.628 --> 06:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
earlier you you have to be able to tell
 
06:33:04.708 --> 06:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
the difference and a lot of that is
 
06:33:04.718 --> 06:33:05.948 align:start position:0%
the difference and a lot of that is
determined

06:33:05.948 --> 06:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
determined
 
06:33:09.070 --> 06:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
by want the testimony your your your
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
body posture your your anger and
 
06:33:16.230 --> 06:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh it is going to come down to he said
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
she said and you just have to you have
 
06:33:21.270 --> 06:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to prove that with your words
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
so I think a lot of the testimony that
 
06:33:24.948 --> 06:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
we're hearing really is just a little
 
06:33:27.350 --> 06:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
bit irrelevant over being afraid that a
 
06:33:28.750 --> 06:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
person might be charged you have to be
 
06:33:32.510 --> 06:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:35.910 --> 06:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
it representative Wells you recognize I
 
06:33:38.948 --> 06:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
think in this bill as
 
06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
amended it is two subjects here somebody
 
06:33:43.910 --> 06:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
who sexually assaults
 
06:33:46.030 --> 06:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
somebody and the person who gets
 
06:33:46.040 --> 06:33:48.230 align:start position:0%
somebody and the person who gets
sexually

06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
sexually
 
06:33:50.910 --> 06:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
assaulted this bill is kind of designed
 
06:33:53.230 --> 06:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
so the person who gets assaulted can get
 
06:33:55.468 --> 06:33:55.478 align:start position:0%
the medical treatment the
 
06:33:59.628 --> 06:33:59.638 align:start position:0%
needs and hopefully the sexual
 
06:34:03.310 --> 06:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
assaulter the per gets ARR
 
06:34:07.910 --> 06:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
rested me it's kind of simple and uh and
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
during the the period last in the last
 
06:34:14.590 --> 06:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
term when we dealt with this bill I met
 
06:34:17.070 --> 06:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
some of these people a couple of them
 
06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
who were
 
06:34:22.190 --> 06:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
assaulted and they described the
 
06:34:25.708 --> 06:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
difficulty they had getting treatment
 
06:34:29.310 --> 06:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:34.030 --> 06:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:36.190 --> 06:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
consideration when it comes
 
06:34:39.310 --> 06:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
to the people who are
 
06:34:43.750 --> 06:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
abusive they tend to the psychological
 
06:34:46.230 --> 06:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
profiles rather consistent but they
 
06:34:48.510 --> 06:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
target particular
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
victims they can they believe that they
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of sometimes it's not
 
06:34:56.548 --> 06:34:56.558 align:start position:0%
always necessarily sex worker but sex
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
workers are particularly targeted and
 
06:35:00.628 --> 06:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
the reason why is that there's a belief
 
06:35:03.430 --> 06:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
that because they are involved in an an
 
06:35:06.708 --> 06:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
act in of itself that is a criminal
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
offense that they're less likely to
 
06:35:10.830 --> 06:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
report it making the abuse and control
 
06:35:14.388 --> 06:35:14.398 align:start position:0%
easier so sex workers are are
 
06:35:17.190 --> 06:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
particularly targeted by Abus of
 
06:35:20.270 --> 06:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
individuals so this uh there's some hope
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
that this
 
06:35:25.350 --> 06:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
would reduce that the frequency that at
 
06:35:31.628 --> 06:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:35.430 --> 06:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
particularly represent true thank you Mr
 
06:35:38.388 --> 06:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
chair um I cannot support the
 
06:35:40.590 --> 06:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
otpa um there are too
 
06:35:44.548 --> 06:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
many gray areas in the
 
06:35:48.910 --> 06:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh unended
 
06:35:52.350 --> 06:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
consequences I do not see anything in
 
06:35:54.070 --> 06:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
this bill that will prevent somebody who
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
has sexually assaulted from going to the
 
06:35:58.350 --> 06:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
hospital and getting the treatment that
 
06:35:58.360 --> 06:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
hospital and getting the treatment that
they

06:36:00.070 --> 06:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
need um if uh if they were to uh to
 
06:36:06.150 --> 06:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
mention to a nurse or a doctor that they
 
06:36:08.270 --> 06:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
were a
 
06:36:10.670 --> 06:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
prostitute I don't what the doctor I'm
 
06:36:12.590 --> 06:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to stop treating you I'm going to
 
06:36:14.510 --> 06:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
call the police and have you arrested I
 
06:36:17.230 --> 06:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
don't think so I don't understand that
 
06:36:21.190 --> 06:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
scenario um what one of the last uh
 
06:36:21.200 --> 06:36:22.468 align:start position:0%
scenario um what one of the last uh
people

06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:36:25.830 --> 06:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
testify brought up the the the very real
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of false
 
06:36:33.388 --> 06:36:33.398 align:start position:0%
accusations and um claiming
 
06:36:35.868 --> 06:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
assault to so they cannot be charged
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
crime and with the
 
06:36:44.230 --> 06:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment they can claim
 
06:36:48.150 --> 06:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
assault and not have to help the
 
06:36:51.310 --> 06:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
police find the perpetrator all they
 
06:36:54.510 --> 06:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
need to do is make the accusation you to
 
06:36:56.910 --> 06:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
cooperate afterwards they don't have to
 
06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
do any
 
06:37:00.788 --> 06:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
reports therefore I don't understand
 
06:37:03.270 --> 06:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
what the bill is doing I don't
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand uh what the end result would
 
06:37:11.388 --> 06:37:11.398 align:start position:0%
be um and that's why I can't support
 
06:37:14.788 --> 06:37:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.150 --> 06:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:22.510 --> 06:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
Knight thank you I'm sorry that there's
 
06:37:25.270 --> 06:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
so much misunderstanding on this bill
 
06:37:30.910 --> 06:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
this is simply a way for victims to get
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the help that they need it's that simple
 
06:37:35.670 --> 06:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for the people that
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
weren't here last year to hear these are
 
06:37:41.350 --> 06:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
real life people they have been denied
 
06:37:44.070 --> 06:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care they have been denied
 
06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
services for protection and they have
 
06:37:50.788 --> 06:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
been shamed and because they're working
 
06:37:55.388 --> 06:37:55.398 align:start position:0%
in the shadows and that makes them open
 
06:37:59.310 --> 06:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
to constantly being manipulated and
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
abused and if there's nobody that can
 
06:38:05.350 --> 06:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
can lend them some help even in the
 
06:38:08.190 --> 06:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
health care industry we've got a major
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
empathy problems on our hands right now
 
06:38:13.628 --> 06:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna challenge each and every one
 
06:38:16.750 --> 06:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
of you to
 
06:38:20.350 --> 06:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
please night to suggest that people lack
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
empathy whe because they don't support
 
06:38:23.070 --> 06:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't believe it's
 
06:38:26.510 --> 06:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to imply that on any member
 
06:38:28.430 --> 06:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh especially someone who hasn't we
 
06:38:30.350 --> 06:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
haven't voted on yet but even if we had
 
06:38:32.310 --> 06:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
imp that would be inappropriate my
 
06:38:34.510 --> 06:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
apologies I meant that the intent of
 
06:38:37.468 --> 06:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is to allow victims to get
 
06:38:41.310 --> 06:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
health care without being prosecuted for
 
06:38:48.388 --> 06:38:48.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:51.948 --> 06:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
you representative Spain thank you Mr
 
06:38:55.350 --> 06:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm going to say I will support
 
06:38:57.788 --> 06:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
otpa I have to admit I've never been in
 
06:39:03.270 --> 06:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
the situation of a sex worker seeking
 
06:39:05.070 --> 06:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
medical help but I have been the parent
 
06:39:06.788 --> 06:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
of a child with
 
06:39:09.430 --> 06:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities and if it makes me nervous
 
06:39:11.830 --> 06:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
to take my son into the emergency room
 
06:39:13.830 --> 06:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm afraid that they might say
 
06:39:16.230 --> 06:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
that I abused him to cause the break or
 
06:39:18.830 --> 06:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
the bruise or the cut or what have you I
 
06:39:21.230 --> 06:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
can only imagine the amount of distress
 
06:39:24.150 --> 06:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
that somebody who was working sex might
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
have in the thought of even going into
 
06:39:30.310 --> 06:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
an emergency want to seek help and as a
 
06:39:34.150 --> 06:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
parent who's been through multiple times
 
06:39:35.910 --> 06:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
having to take my son into the emergency
 
06:39:38.788 --> 06:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
room and praying that they didn't think
 
06:39:41.110 --> 06:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
that what he did to injure himself was
 
06:39:43.110 --> 06:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
in any way some sort of abuse because I
 
06:39:44.830 --> 06:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't find out about that for days
 
06:39:47.468 --> 06:39:47.478 align:start position:0%
when I finally was contacted by
 
06:39:49.868 --> 06:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
authorities it's just a distressing
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
situation that I think that uh we can
 
06:39:54.630 --> 06:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
probably put an answer
 
06:39:54.640 --> 06:40:00.510 align:start position:0%
probably put an answer

06:40:00.510 --> 06:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:03.788 --> 06:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
06:40:06.310 --> 06:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm extremely confused
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
now I'm reading this bill and I don't
 
06:40:15.628 --> 06:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:18.548 --> 06:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
here you know I I see where you know
 
06:40:20.310 --> 06:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
they can go to the hospital well you
 
06:40:21.990 --> 06:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
know I don't even mention the hospital
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
but it just says you know they are
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
abused that they can reach out and tell
 
06:40:29.670 --> 06:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and if I'm wrong I would
 
06:40:33.388 --> 06:40:33.398 align:start position:0%
like somebody to explain yes I'm
 
06:40:36.628 --> 06:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
wrong tell me that the dev is about
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
people that are abused and it's not just
 
06:40:41.948 --> 06:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
women I wish people would stop saying
 
06:40:46.270 --> 06:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
just women guys get abused too tell me
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
that this is truly for the victim not
 
06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:57.468 --> 06:40:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:00.388 --> 06:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
on underlying deil it discusses some
 
06:41:02.750 --> 06:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
healthare options I believe start line
 
06:41:06.110 --> 06:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
15 but it's I I don't agree there
 
06:41:08.190 --> 06:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
limited just to getting health
 
06:41:13.310 --> 06:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:16.830 --> 06:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the person making the report it's
 
06:41:19.190 --> 06:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
really to report the reporting the
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
violent crime is
 
06:41:23.548 --> 06:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
really basically getting a person that's
 
06:41:26.548 --> 06:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
been sex solv into a safe environment
 
06:41:27.548 --> 06:41:27.558 align:start position:0%
whether that involves them getting
 
06:41:29.388 --> 06:41:29.398 align:start position:0%
healthare or not I I think it's material
 
06:41:31.150 --> 06:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
that they get healthare order to invoke
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
this okay but it that is an option the
 
06:41:37.548 --> 06:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that not say problem
 
06:41:40.708 --> 06:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
but the concern that the amendment resol
 
06:41:40.718 --> 06:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
but the concern that the amendment resol
was

06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:41:45.070 --> 06:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
that federal law will not perit the
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
option of getting the healthare and the
 
06:41:49.070 --> 06:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
immunity side contingent on getting the
 
06:41:50.670 --> 06:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare you need to separate that
 
06:41:52.708 --> 06:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
requirement of cooperation that's
 
06:41:54.270 --> 06:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
apparently a federal law that's based on
 
06:41:57.788 --> 06:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
the Tes so the amendment clarified that
 
06:41:59.708 --> 06:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
federal law conflict that I'm still I
 
06:42:01.070 --> 06:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
haven't independently verified that but
 
06:42:04.430 --> 06:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's what testimony was yes so it's
 
06:42:06.350 --> 06:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is part of this but not it's
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
not the end all the all all right thank
 
06:42:13.030 --> 06:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:15.750 --> 06:42:15.760 align:start position:0%

gotten from the house leadership earlier
 
06:44:29.948 --> 06:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
is that there actually is no hard fast
 
06:44:32.430 --> 06:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
rule as to when it want consent
 
06:44:35.708 --> 06:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
objective still be put
 
06:44:38.110 --> 06:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
onent because it can be removed by any
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%

rules you can say without objection and
 
06:44:49.150 --> 06:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
then if somebody that has
 
06:44:51.670 --> 06:44:51.680 align:start position:0%

sir um well the prime sponsor herself
 
06:46:11.750 --> 06:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
and her testimony did say that when I
 
06:46:14.788 --> 06:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
asked what the impet of this bill I
 
06:46:16.350 --> 06:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't really sure I think it was an old
 
06:46:18.750 --> 06:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
archaic language that turns out was
 
06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
actually uh amended in 1987 so certainly
 
06:46:23.910 --> 06:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
isn't that
 
06:46:27.388 --> 06:46:27.398 align:start position:0%
and uh seeing that it also doesn't
 
06:46:29.150 --> 06:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate the practice just the the
 
06:46:31.110 --> 06:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
mention of the words there's no need for
 
06:46:31.120 --> 06:46:40.590 align:start position:0%

06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:02.990 --> 06:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
classifi got pardoned by a President
 
06:47:07.230 --> 06:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
Obama uh and thinks that being a
 
06:47:11.310 --> 06:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
traitor is okay but not being a
 
06:47:13.150 --> 06:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
confinement I
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:25.150 --> 06:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
support representative
 
06:47:28.388 --> 06:47:28.398 align:start position:0%
M I'll be supporting this bill because I
 
06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
think commissioner Hanks was pretty
 
06:47:34.030 --> 06:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
clear that uh on the fact that uh what
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does and and I think the
 
06:47:37.868 --> 06:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor was clear too is it bans this as
 
06:47:40.670 --> 06:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
a form of of punishment but it doesn't
 
06:47:42.750 --> 06:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
ban the practice in other cases when
 
06:47:42.760 --> 06:47:43.708 align:start position:0%
ban the practice in other cases when
it's

06:47:43.708 --> 06:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
necessary um I think uh commissioner
 
06:47:49.350 --> 06:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hanks also said she was actually looking
 
06:47:52.070 --> 06:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
forward to having some of the language
 
06:47:54.948 --> 06:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh updated because uh that that
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
particular section is
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
archaic uh so I'm I'm not sure I
 
06:48:02.430 --> 06:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
understand the uh uh the opposition I'll
 
06:48:04.510 --> 06:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
be voting for it I'm sorry I'll be
 
06:48:10.830 --> 06:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.590 --> 06:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
itl seeing no further hands
 
06:48:17.670 --> 06:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
raised the matter will not be put
 
06:48:19.868 --> 06:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
the close representative
 
06:48:25.070 --> 06:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
Bo recognized yes thank you m chair um
 
06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
well at the state prison we uh we think
 
06:48:32.670 --> 06:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
that there's no real need for the bill
 
06:48:35.990 --> 06:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
but that does not necessarily flow down
 
06:48:41.670 --> 06:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
to uh County jails so um I'm also going
 
06:48:45.868 --> 06:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
to uh oppose the itl uh in favor for
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:52.120 --> 06:48:54.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:48:54.750 --> 06:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:48:57.590 --> 06:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative bman you
 
06:49:01.270 --> 06:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
recogniz thank you um I think that maybe
 
06:49:02.910 --> 06:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's a misunderstanding about the
 
06:49:04.388 --> 06:49:04.398 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given by the
 
06:49:06.070 --> 06:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
Corrections um there's an amendment that
 
06:49:11.230 --> 06:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner felt was important uh
 
06:49:14.590 --> 06:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
to move through this committee which
 
06:49:17.910 --> 06:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
would um which would give the
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner the
 
06:49:24.628 --> 06:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
authority to discipline inmates for
 
06:49:27.590 --> 06:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
specific reasons um such as attempting
 
06:49:31.548 --> 06:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
to escape um or being violent so I think
 
06:49:34.430 --> 06:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
that it would be wise to vote down the
 
06:49:38.110 --> 06:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
itl so that we could maybe consider the
 
06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that was personally drafted by
 
06:49:43.830 --> 06:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
06:49:48.030 --> 06:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
Corrections so that um she could
 
06:49:52.590 --> 06:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
update um the existing law to reflect
 
06:49:55.070 --> 06:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the current practice in the state
 
06:50:02.948 --> 06:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:06.830 --> 06:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
you I just may POS a question if I
 
06:50:08.190 --> 06:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between having
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
the LA cified in pass as opposed to
 
06:50:18.190 --> 06:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
practice but if if the practice is one
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
policy that is not
 
06:50:23.388 --> 06:50:23.398 align:start position:0%
illegal I suppose having this pass this
 
06:50:25.830 --> 06:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't change how the
 
06:50:29.948 --> 06:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are hand handling soling
 
06:50:34.910 --> 06:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:37.830 --> 06:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
saying um I'm sorry can you repeat that
 
06:50:39.590 --> 06:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
there were some connection issues and I
 
06:50:41.750 --> 06:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
had trouble processing your words I'll
 
06:50:44.430 --> 06:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
say again if the if the this is
 
06:50:46.350 --> 06:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
basically to update the the lawful
 
06:50:48.670 --> 06:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
practice of how solitary confin is being
 
06:50:54.110 --> 06:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
used already but I suppose
 
06:50:55.628 --> 06:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to change any practice
 
06:51:02.110 --> 06:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:06.070 --> 06:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
being uh yes so there was a mention of
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh change as recent as I think the 80s
 
06:51:11.830 --> 06:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
the um I have some research from the
 
06:51:14.230 --> 06:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
research Department in the state house
 
06:51:16.110 --> 06:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
showing that this was originally
 
06:51:18.468 --> 06:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
codified in in the
 
06:51:22.350 --> 06:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
1867 and at the time this encompassed
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
the entire of interactions between
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
correction staff and inmates um this was
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh this was really all that they needed
 
06:51:32.430 --> 06:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
to say about how to run a facility and
 
06:51:35.548 --> 06:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
how to discipline inmates and um back
 
06:51:38.590 --> 06:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
then work was commonly um you know fied
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
work uh building things um work was a
 
06:51:46.868 --> 06:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
lot more involved and and was far more
 
06:51:50.788 --> 06:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
attached really tied to your way of um
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
making right with the community
 
06:51:58.670 --> 06:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh work was an important way to um to to
 
06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
pay your dues to society and that's not
 
06:52:05.150 --> 06:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
so much the uh nature of incarceration
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
now now there's a focus on education uh
 
06:52:12.150 --> 06:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
medication uh treatment things like that
 
06:52:16.430 --> 06:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
and um so the the amendment that I would
 
06:52:19.110 --> 06:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
like to be considered suspending for
 
06:52:22.510 --> 06:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
moment you answered the question I they
 
06:52:25.270 --> 06:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
give you leeway but you weren't
 
06:52:28.270 --> 06:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
recognize to speak in you know just
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
to continue to advocate for in Opp itl
 
06:52:33.628 --> 06:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
06:52:36.788 --> 06:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
just at this point this a simple
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
question that you've answered I thank
 
06:52:39.510 --> 06:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking the
 
06:52:41.868 --> 06:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
06:52:44.708 --> 06:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
G just want to make sure I have this
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
right it it did um repal County
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities from using the
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
close and solitary confinement
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
however it didn't um the
 
06:53:01.990 --> 06:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
DLC and I thought what was said was that
 
06:53:04.708 --> 06:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
um they have rules in place
 
06:53:09.150 --> 06:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
now that speak to um you know solitary
 
06:53:12.670 --> 06:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
confinement or or using the
 
06:53:18.670 --> 06:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
clothes so I say that to say that um
 
06:53:20.510 --> 06:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
06:53:23.708 --> 06:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
was you know
 
06:53:26.510 --> 06:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
repealed did I get that right from what
 
06:53:26.520 --> 06:53:28.270 align:start position:0%
repealed did I get that right from what
I

06:53:28.270 --> 06:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:53:33.830 --> 06:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:36.110 --> 06:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I defer that to the to the
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee as whole okay Amanda um
 
06:53:39.120 --> 06:53:40.708 align:start position:0%
committee as whole okay Amanda um
representative

06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:53:43.030 --> 06:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
Balden repres B please address the
 
06:53:46.628 --> 06:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
question asked by representative
 
06:53:49.788 --> 06:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
G um I'm really sorry but I is it
 
06:53:51.590 --> 06:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
possible to phrase it a in a little more
 
06:53:56.110 --> 06:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
concise way when time okay
 
06:54:01.430 --> 06:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:01.440 --> 06:54:03.310 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

06:54:03.310 --> 06:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:54:05.830 --> 06:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
repeal the corre County correctional
 
06:54:10.430 --> 06:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
facility from using um Clos or solitary
 
06:54:13.670 --> 06:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
confinement yes um the answer is sort of
 
06:54:15.868 --> 06:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
yes it's just that the amendment doesn't
 
06:54:17.548 --> 06:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
address that portion of the existing
 
06:54:20.150 --> 06:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill so the bill has three sections the
 
06:54:21.910 --> 06:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
first section addresses the state
 
06:54:24.190 --> 06:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
facility the second section addresses
 
06:54:25.948 --> 06:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
County facilities and the third section
 
06:54:28.150 --> 06:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
just dictates when the bill would take
 
06:54:31.388 --> 06:54:31.398 align:start position:0%
effect if passed into law and the second
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
section addresses that the county uh
 
06:54:37.110 --> 06:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
repeals the portion that allows the
 
06:54:41.468 --> 06:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
county moment uh it was that was as
 
06:54:43.628 --> 06:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
close to a yes to no question as water
 
06:54:47.110 --> 06:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
have uh which you you did answer the
 
06:54:49.750 --> 06:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
question we just and to let you go
 
06:54:52.110 --> 06:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
on we can't recognize some to speak a
 
06:54:54.468 --> 06:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
second time all the people which to
 
06:54:56.788 --> 06:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
speak um
 
06:54:59.750 --> 06:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
have the hand so if you're going beyond
 
06:55:05.070 --> 06:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:07.788 --> 06:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
bsby yes uh thank you um so it the way
 
06:55:14.548 --> 06:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
that I'm reading the amendment is that
 
06:55:18.030 --> 06:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the entire first
 
06:55:21.868 --> 06:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and that uh and uh
 
06:55:24.350 --> 06:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
rather than just changing the language
 
06:55:26.670 --> 06:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
what the amendment seems to do is set
 
06:55:31.030 --> 06:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
forth a modernized um approach to how
 
06:55:34.270 --> 06:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
discipline is handled by the Corrections
 
06:55:37.590 --> 06:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
Department and that would be essentially
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
replacing what was previously uh set out
 
06:55:44.590 --> 06:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
as the way that discipline was done and
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the the what the amendment does is
 
06:55:51.110 --> 06:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
essentially sets in statute The
 
06:55:53.070 --> 06:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
Authority for the Commissioner of
 
06:55:58.750 --> 06:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections to um make rules that are uh
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
following modern uh best practices for
 
06:56:06.230 --> 06:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
discipline so it seems like with the
 
06:56:09.750 --> 06:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I could support this um uh
 
06:56:13.430 --> 06:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and is the section section two
 
06:56:15.350 --> 06:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
I think has been discussed is just
 
06:56:18.070 --> 06:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
getting rid of what is really an archaic
 
06:56:20.910 --> 06:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's not needed at the county
 
06:56:25.230 --> 06:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:28.150 --> 06:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised oh oh
 
06:56:28.160 --> 06:56:29.670 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised oh oh
excuse

06:56:29.670 --> 06:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
06:56:32.430 --> 06:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
me I want to address the difference
 
06:56:35.590 --> 06:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
between the state prison and the jails
 
06:56:37.590 --> 06:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps representative Wallace
 
06:56:40.150 --> 06:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
will follow along with
 
06:56:43.070 --> 06:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
me in the in the jails we have two
 
06:56:45.868 --> 06:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
sections of those people who are
 
06:56:48.750 --> 06:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
convicted and serving their sh sentences
 
06:56:51.430 --> 06:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we have their people awaiting trial
 
06:56:53.070 --> 06:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
the people a waiting trial could be
 
06:56:56.030 --> 06:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
anything from murderers to rapists you
 
06:56:59.948 --> 06:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
name it and you can't make them work so
 
06:57:03.150 --> 06:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
I think just repealing this section in
 
06:57:06.468 --> 06:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
the County correctional business is not
 
06:57:09.830 --> 06:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
a good idea correct now what the
 
06:57:12.670 --> 06:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner has said about her uh State
 
06:57:14.590 --> 06:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
Prison that's
 
06:57:17.430 --> 06:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
good but why are we
 
06:57:20.548 --> 06:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
eliminating why are we eliminating the
 
06:57:23.150 --> 06:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
authority of the county Coral
 
06:57:26.468 --> 06:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:29.310 --> 06:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
jails the people who are arrested they
 
06:57:31.468 --> 06:57:31.478 align:start position:0%
all all different
 
06:57:33.990 --> 06:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind and and it's not it's a very
 
06:57:36.590 --> 06:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous place in the county jail even
 
06:57:38.670 --> 06:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
more so than the state
 
06:57:42.430 --> 06:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
pres so I think if we're going to pass
 
06:57:46.270 --> 06:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
this we should re amend it and take out
 
06:57:46.280 --> 06:57:50.590 align:start position:0%
this we should re amend it and take out
section

06:57:50.590 --> 06:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:57.150 --> 06:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:04.868 --> 06:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:08.388 --> 06:58:08.398 align:start position:0%
plane thank you Mr chair I have to agree
 
06:58:11.070 --> 06:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
with the vice chair and my biggest
 
06:58:13.310 --> 06:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill from the
 
06:58:15.388 --> 06:58:15.398 align:start position:0%
beginning even looking at the amended
 
06:58:17.388 --> 06:58:17.398 align:start position:0%
version has been the complete and total
 
06:58:21.030 --> 06:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
repeal of section 30-b col 7 and I
 
06:58:22.948 --> 06:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
actually looked it up to find out how
 
06:58:25.310 --> 06:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
much was actually being repealed by that
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
statement and it's essentially one
 
06:58:29.468 --> 06:58:29.478 align:start position:0%
paragraph that says discipline of
 
06:58:32.628 --> 06:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
inmates now this was created in 1988
 
06:58:34.430 --> 06:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's not archaic and it's not very long
 
06:58:36.830 --> 06:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
ago says if any invate in the County
 
06:58:38.590 --> 06:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
Correction Facility is refractory and
 
06:58:40.868 --> 06:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
stubborn and refuses to work or perform
 
06:58:42.590 --> 06:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
his work in a proper manner the
 
06:58:44.430 --> 06:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent may put him in close
 
06:58:46.708 --> 06:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
confinement until he submits to perform
 
06:58:48.910 --> 06:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
his task and obey the superintendent's
 
06:58:51.628 --> 06:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
orders it's as simple as that and if we
 
06:58:53.190 --> 06:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
take that out
 
06:58:55.150 --> 06:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
that to me means that we have removed
 
06:58:57.350 --> 06:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
one method of controlling the inmates
 
06:59:01.150 --> 06:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
who are unruly at the county level and
 
06:59:03.628 --> 06:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
we know that the county inmates do do
 
06:59:06.830 --> 06:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
work you see them out doing work jobs
 
06:59:08.670 --> 06:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
often times it's voluntary and they get
 
06:59:11.150 --> 06:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
asked if they want to but I'm not going
 
06:59:12.948 --> 06:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
to get involved in the micromanagement
 
06:59:20.190 --> 06:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:23.070 --> 06:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
either I
 
06:59:26.150 --> 06:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
yes motion is an I so I still just have
 
06:59:29.750 --> 06:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
a question so section
 
06:59:32.830 --> 06:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
two exists today
 
06:59:35.468 --> 06:59:35.478 align:start position:0%
correct that's not something that just
 
06:59:39.110 --> 06:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:42.468 --> 06:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
right repeal on the original on the
 
06:59:45.270 --> 06:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
original bill that repeals current
 
06:59:47.628 --> 06:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
statute yeah yeah but that was already
 
06:59:50.990 --> 06:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
there I mean that's not new no correct
 
06:59:54.030 --> 06:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
that was on the original bill
 
07:00:00.310 --> 07:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.548 --> 07:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
know representative Newman you're
 
07:00:05.830 --> 07:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr
 
07:00:07.948 --> 07:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
chair I think when we get into the
 
07:00:10.270 --> 07:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of micromanagement and bills
 
07:00:11.590 --> 07:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
and what should be taken out and what
 
07:00:13.310 --> 07:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
should be left in it was always my
 
07:00:16.430 --> 07:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
opinion that you don't necessarily have
 
07:00:18.590 --> 07:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
to make all the rules and regulations
 
07:00:21.388 --> 07:00:21.398 align:start position:0%
that a prison would run by by passing
 
07:00:24.910 --> 07:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to ensure that that solitary
 
07:00:28.270 --> 07:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
confinement is uh appropriately um
 
07:00:30.510 --> 07:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
administered and I think based on the
 
07:00:33.150 --> 07:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that I thought I heard was
 
07:00:35.388 --> 07:00:35.398 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner also said that
 
07:00:36.990 --> 07:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
they have close confinement and other
 
07:00:40.670 --> 07:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
terms for what in effect fact is defecto
 
07:00:44.110 --> 07:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh solitary confinement and those rules
 
07:00:45.788 --> 07:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
are described and I think even at the
 
07:00:47.788 --> 07:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
end of this bill it might say they will
 
07:00:49.548 --> 07:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
be appro the best practices
 
07:00:51.548 --> 07:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
appropriately described in regulations
 
07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
or something to that nature because I'm
 
07:00:55.030 --> 07:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
not looking at the bill because I can't
 
07:00:57.190 --> 07:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
do zoom in that at the same time but
 
07:00:59.110 --> 07:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion on whether or not and
 
07:01:01.830 --> 07:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote Yes for this Bill
 
07:01:05.350 --> 07:01:05.360 align:start position:0%

really GP
 
07:03:41.510 --> 07:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
this but the more I looked into it it
 
07:03:43.468 --> 07:03:43.478 align:start position:0%
actually requires the government to do
 
07:03:46.468 --> 07:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
what they ought to do
 
07:03:46.478 --> 07:03:48.310 align:start position:0%
what they ought to do
is

07:03:48.310 --> 07:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:03:48.320 --> 07:03:50.190 align:start position:0%
is
ask

07:03:50.190 --> 07:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
ask
 
07:03:52.830 --> 07:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
authorities into your information I'm
 
07:03:55.110 --> 07:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
not even sure how to be there then but
 
07:03:58.070 --> 07:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
at least this gets them out of just
 
07:04:00.150 --> 07:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
making a phone call and having somebody
 
07:04:05.788 --> 07:04:05.798 align:start position:0%

representative Muse you
 
07:04:30.190 --> 07:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
recognized yes thank you um uh I'm going
 
07:04:33.350 --> 07:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
to oppose the motion ought to pass I I
 
07:04:35.388 --> 07:04:35.398 align:start position:0%
really do wish we would have had a
 
07:04:37.310 --> 07:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
little more expert testimony in this
 
07:04:40.948 --> 07:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
case uh we didn't hear from uh anybody
 
07:04:43.388 --> 07:04:43.398 align:start position:0%
in the carriers regarding the carriers
 
07:04:45.150 --> 07:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office wasn't
 
07:04:47.110 --> 07:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
available to tell us what their position
 
07:04:50.310 --> 07:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
was uh on this particular issue I'm
 
07:04:52.468 --> 07:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that there is is a
 
07:04:55.750 --> 07:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
case law uh out there that actually does
 
07:04:58.110 --> 07:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
require search warrants in some states
 
07:05:01.990 --> 07:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be uh obtained in in cases like this
 
07:05:04.150 --> 07:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
um but I'm just very wary of adding
 
07:05:07.070 --> 07:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
something like this to our statute uh
 
07:05:10.510 --> 07:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
Without Really thoroughly vetting it uh
 
07:05:12.590 --> 07:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I I don't really feel like we did
 
07:05:15.350 --> 07:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
that today um I thought we got off to a
 
07:05:18.150 --> 07:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
good start uh but to me this is a
 
07:05:20.548 --> 07:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
classic example of a of a bill I think
 
07:05:23.190 --> 07:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at a little bit
 
07:05:45.070 --> 07:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:45.080 --> 07:05:46.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

07:05:46.830 --> 07:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:05:51.830 --> 07:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
so one one point that I would make is in
 
07:05:53.548 --> 07:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
I I do agreee with representative ton
 
07:05:55.590 --> 07:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
that I had some concerns about this bill
 
07:05:58.030 --> 07:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
when I first read
 
07:06:00.548 --> 07:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
it what but what I was looking at here
 
07:06:02.868 --> 07:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
is that it's one thing for the attorney
 
07:06:06.070 --> 07:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
general or law enforcement to request
 
07:06:08.910 --> 07:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
information from any communication
 
07:06:11.310 --> 07:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
Comming C right from a cell phone
 
07:06:13.468 --> 07:06:13.478 align:start position:0%
company they they can request
 
07:06:16.708 --> 07:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
it but this the whyw is written they
 
07:06:19.468 --> 07:06:19.478 align:start position:0%
they really sort of have to comply with
 
07:06:22.150 --> 07:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
as long as there's some reason to
 
07:06:23.628 --> 07:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
long as the AG says that we have reason
 
07:06:25.030 --> 07:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
to believe that there's information on
 
07:06:28.150 --> 07:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
there that will help us in an
 
07:06:30.388 --> 07:06:30.398 align:start position:0%
investigation I I was under the belief
 
07:06:33.150 --> 07:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
that the law would allow them the option
 
07:06:35.350 --> 07:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
to comply but they don't have to the
 
07:06:36.388 --> 07:06:36.398 align:start position:0%
fact that they don't really have much of
 
07:06:41.030 --> 07:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
an option of not complying in my
 
07:06:43.350 --> 07:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
opinion if it's not a four Comm
 
07:06:45.190 --> 07:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
violation is very
 
07:06:47.948 --> 07:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
close so I'm surprised if it's not if
 
07:06:49.708 --> 07:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary surrender just like a
 
07:06:52.670 --> 07:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary search we can agree to
 
07:06:56.388 --> 07:06:56.398 align:start position:0%
provide information all you want
 
07:06:59.310 --> 07:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
but doesn't seem necessarily voluntary
 
07:07:01.230 --> 07:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
here now
 
07:07:03.788 --> 07:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
understand that's just if a cell phone
 
07:07:07.270 --> 07:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
provider wanted to not cooperate really
 
07:07:08.948 --> 07:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
some somebody they take pride on
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:19.030 --> 07:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
customers so I'm going to support the
 
07:07:20.510 --> 07:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
07:07:20.520 --> 07:07:22.788 align:start position:0%
most of the
T

07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
T
 
07:07:27.070 --> 07:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:29.910 --> 07:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
raised thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
07:07:33.910 --> 07:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
to point out uh during testimony I was
 
07:07:37.190 --> 07:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
very surprised by attorney Penny Dean
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
who at the beginning of her testimony I
 
07:07:41.670 --> 07:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
thought she was going to be opposed to
 
07:07:44.708 --> 07:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
this bill and in the final analysis she
 
07:07:47.990 --> 07:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
was telling us she supported it and that
 
07:07:50.430 --> 07:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
was strong for
 
07:07:50.440 --> 07:07:55.388 align:start position:0%
was strong for
me

07:07:55.388 --> 07:07:55.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:58.628 --> 07:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
W thank you Mr chairman I too initially
 
07:08:01.670 --> 07:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh was somewhat opposed to the bill
 
07:08:03.230 --> 07:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
thinking it had to do with metadata and
 
07:08:05.750 --> 07:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
whatnot but as we peel back the Lays of
 
07:08:07.430 --> 07:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
the onion it seems like this particular
 
07:08:09.910 --> 07:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
Bill does do quite a bit of good to
 
07:08:12.310 --> 07:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
strengthen the Privacy rights of uh ened
 
07:08:16.548 --> 07:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:19.590 --> 07:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill seeing No Hands raised uh the
 
07:08:21.468 --> 07:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
matter will now be put to question if
 
07:08:23.070 --> 07:08:23.080 align:start position:0%

have a
 
07:15:08.510 --> 07:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
question I will phrase this as a
 
07:15:10.750 --> 07:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
question do you know if a bill has a
 
07:15:12.830 --> 07:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note if it can go on
 
07:15:16.030 --> 07:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
consent that's a good question fantastic
 
07:15:19.788 --> 07:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
question the answer is no you're not
 
07:15:19.798 --> 07:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
question the answer is no you're not
go

07:15:31.110 --> 07:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:36.150 --> 07:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:40.150 --> 07:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
123 doesn't have but when it has the the
 
07:15:41.948 --> 07:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
issue of the fiscal note is that
 
07:15:41.958 --> 07:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
issue of the fiscal note is that
something

07:15:43.590 --> 07:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
07:15:46.708 --> 07:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
that we as a committee on and this is a
 
07:15:49.708 --> 07:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry to the vice
 
07:15:49.718 --> 07:15:51.628 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry to the vice
chair

07:15:51.628 --> 07:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
07:15:54.628 --> 07:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
because because the fiscal note we don't
 
07:15:57.150 --> 07:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
consider the fiscal note I we obviously
 
07:15:58.590 --> 07:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
that consideration that's not something
 
07:16:02.350 --> 07:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
that no I think the the fiscal
 
07:16:05.750 --> 07:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
note estimated increase or decrease is z
 
07:16:08.548 --> 07:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
z all way corre that's correct so that's
 
07:16:10.910 --> 07:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
really not that's a fiscal that means
 
07:16:12.830 --> 07:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
somebody requested a fiscal analysis and
 
07:16:16.070 --> 07:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
it said nothing yeah I be
 
07:16:18.830 --> 07:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
recognized well you're not you're not
 
07:16:21.628 --> 07:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
recogniz represent pi
 
07:16:25.590 --> 07:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh on the fiscal note um the amount
 
07:16:27.430 --> 07:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note matters in terms of
 
07:16:30.670 --> 07:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
whether it can go on consent and i' I'd
 
07:16:32.388 --> 07:16:32.398 align:start position:0%
want to double check with the clerk on
 
07:16:34.190 --> 07:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
this but I think that if the amount is
 
07:16:37.468 --> 07:16:37.478 align:start position:0%
under 10,000 then it can go on consent I
 
07:16:40.670 --> 07:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
think it's rule 35 maybe rule 37 right
 
07:16:43.990 --> 07:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
all zero concr all Zer
 
07:16:47.190 --> 07:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
that so I'll move I'll move with consent
 
07:16:49.670 --> 07:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
if if the clerk I will consult with the
 
07:16:51.910 --> 07:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
clerk has a precaution
 
07:16:53.670 --> 07:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we're doing things the
 
07:16:53.680 --> 07:16:54.670 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we're doing things the
proper

07:16:54.670 --> 07:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
proper
 
07:16:58.190 --> 07:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
way if we I see a lot of hands raised I
 
07:17:00.628 --> 07:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
will say that if we don't I don't answer
 
07:17:04.830 --> 07:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
many questions we could exact more bills
 
07:17:08.110 --> 07:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
so they probably have a question of the
 
07:17:14.468 --> 07:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:16.510 --> 07:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
pass thank
 
07:17:19.590 --> 07:17:19.600 align:start position:0%

83 546 is now on consent we'll now close

second second by representative
 
07:18:07.910 --> 07:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mar you wish to speak to your motion uh
 
07:18:11.788 --> 07:18:11.798 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman just very briefly um you
 
07:18:15.110 --> 07:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
know from the testimony I hear that our
 
07:18:19.270 --> 07:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
current laws are working somewhat you
 
07:18:21.310 --> 07:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
know people still you know we could pass
 
07:18:23.150 --> 07:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
5,000 laws people are still going to do
 
07:18:25.070 --> 07:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
it um
 
07:18:25.080 --> 07:18:27.670 align:start position:0%
it um
but

07:18:27.670 --> 07:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:31.430 --> 07:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
here this bill uh takes control away
 
07:18:35.548 --> 07:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
from the May suspend license to shall
 
07:18:39.110 --> 07:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
suspend license and I really disapprove
 
07:18:42.270 --> 07:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
of that I think the uh the person in
 
07:18:44.708 --> 07:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
charge of doing that should have the
 
07:18:47.110 --> 07:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
authority because you know sadly
 
07:18:50.070 --> 07:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
mistakes happen um I hope with those
 
07:18:52.230 --> 07:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
mistakes nothing you know no children
 
07:18:54.670 --> 07:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
get hurt or accidents happen but you
 
07:18:58.708 --> 07:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:01.430 --> 07:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
of you know control there and this bill
 
07:19:03.708 --> 07:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of control away from people
 
07:19:05.590 --> 07:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know dealing with these people that
 
07:19:13.830 --> 07:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:16.910 --> 07:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
it represent Conley you're recognized
 
07:19:17.890 --> 07:19:17.900 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
07:19:22.030 --> 07:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
chairman benefit of hearing this bill a
 
07:19:25.388 --> 07:19:25.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:27.948 --> 07:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
servation and
 
07:19:32.628 --> 07:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
have testimony not here today aled to by
 
07:19:35.628 --> 07:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
the CRI sponsor there is a real lack of
 
07:19:38.310 --> 07:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
clarity for judges on how to proceive
 
07:19:39.990 --> 07:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
the second offenses although we know
 
07:19:43.070 --> 07:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
that there aren't that many of them
 
07:19:47.350 --> 07:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
um when they you come the May versus sh
 
07:19:51.548 --> 07:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
is effectively a default to not going to
 
07:19:54.110 --> 07:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
suspend A license they default to not
 
07:19:57.590 --> 07:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
taking that step this clarifies that for
 
07:20:00.430 --> 07:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
the court essentally clarifies What's
 
07:20:03.868 --> 07:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
happen um and the other thing I would
 
07:20:05.788 --> 07:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
remind the committee is although there
 
07:20:08.708 --> 07:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
are very few cases where second offenses
 
07:20:11.510 --> 07:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
are prosecuted we heard from the
 
07:20:14.270 --> 07:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
sergeant that that does not reflect
 
07:20:16.150 --> 07:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
what's actually happening with the
 
07:20:18.548 --> 07:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
number of times this is
 
07:20:21.430 --> 07:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
occurring this bill has been you know
 
07:20:25.628 --> 07:20:25.638 align:start position:0%
Vex Transportation last term uh it is
 
07:20:27.230 --> 07:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that I struggled with around
 
07:20:30.750 --> 07:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
the license suspension but um mistakes
 
07:20:34.750 --> 07:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
do happen uh and um and that's where the
 
07:20:36.750 --> 07:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
first offense comes in the second
 
07:20:38.670 --> 07:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
offense I think is requires something
 
07:20:49.030 --> 07:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:51.948 --> 07:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
against that's seeing no further hands
 
07:20:54.150 --> 07:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
raised the matter when I'll be put the
 
07:20:56.270 --> 07:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
question if you in support of the motion
 
07:20:58.110 --> 07:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
