madam chairman
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
voter integrity continues to be a
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
challenge here in new hampshire as as
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
many of us know as all of us know
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of pieces of
 
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.870 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of pieces of
legislation

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
introduced and
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh with with um
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
without success at least so far
 
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
without success at least so far
and

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment would would
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
be another approach to this and i think
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
it should be followed and
 
00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
it should be followed and
pursued

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
pursued
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
amendment

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
we did discuss that from public hearing
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
um i will not
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking to the amendment
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's not really necessary because it's
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
already addressed in statutes
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and we feel that it adds confusion by
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
including the undefined term primary
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
residence residency
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
and it also makes reference to a citizen
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
which is an unusual reference and no one
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it creates confusion so
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%

will be due today
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going back to the old school
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
where we used to pass out paper at the
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
end of the session and no one was
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to leave until their report was
 
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.390 align:start position:0%
allowed to leave until their report was

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
the next bill to be considered by the

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:16.830 align:start position:0%

64.
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
1064 is requiring the use of handmark
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
durable paper ballots in elections
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
it also prohibits the use of an
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
electronic any electronic device to
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
count and tally ballots there was a
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
on january 13th
 
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.110 align:start position:0%
on january 13th
is

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
there a motion on 1064 representative
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
mcdonald yes madam chairman i'd like to
 
00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
mcdonald yes madam chairman i'd like to
move

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1064 fn and expedite into legislate
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
i second then
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'll give this second to
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
joan handle it thank you
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that's your fleeting moment of glory
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
for that it's not recorded anywhere else
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm not making light of the bill i i
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
just appreciated that there were more
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
than one second uh representative
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
mcdonald would you like to speak to your
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
motion yes i would madam chairman
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh there has been no evidence of hacking
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
of these machines
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
the windham audit was um
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
which were all very very familiar did
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
not produce any evidence of hacking uh
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
we you know it came down to a folding
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
issue that hopefully will not be
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
repeated by any community and especially
 
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
repeated by any community and especially
windham

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
windham
 
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
windham
um

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
if ultimately it's going to be
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
determined that a community does not use
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
the machines that should be determined
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
by that community and not be mandated by
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
the state so for that reason i move this
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to speak to the
 
00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:55.669 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to speak to the
motion

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i find uh
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald's arguments very
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
persuasive and
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
also want to note that
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
machine counting under when when
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
procedures are followed is is often more
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
accurate than than a hand count and that
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that needs to be remembered also in
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh just how essential they can be in
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
does anybody else wish to speak to the
 
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.789 align:start position:0%
does anybody else wish to speak to the
motion

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i i am going to speak to the motion
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
i understand the significant concerns
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
that people have in regards to the
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
conduct of elections and by voting for
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
this motion i am not dismissing them
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
i do think we have handled the issue of
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
using paper ballots in other legislation
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
so the reality is i think the impact of
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is in regards to the use of
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
the electronic counting devices that are
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
currently approved by the ballot law
 
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.070 align:start position:0%
currently approved by the ballot law
commission

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there are two different
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
avenues that addressing machines should
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
be taking one is the local level this
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
meeting was specifically scheduled for
 
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
meeting was specifically scheduled for
today

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
to allow the communities that had had
 
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.190 align:start position:0%
to allow the communities that had had
this

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
item brought forward on their warrant to
 
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.310 align:start position:0%
item brought forward on their warrant to
vote

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
i understand that the communities that
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
voted on this as a warrant article in
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
their town were sb2 towns a lot of them
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
will be having town meetings later this
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
week but there is no town that voted
 
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.630 align:start position:0%
week but there is no town that voted
yesterday

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
that supported the elimination of
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
electro of the accounting devices that
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
are currently used no town including
 
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
are currently used no town including
windham

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that to require this for
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
every community in the state would not
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
be appropriate the second reason i am
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the legislation coming
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
forward this way is that by statute we
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
give authority to the ballot law
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
commission to address the use of
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
machines and if there is an issue with
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
the machines i think the appropriate way
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
to address it is through the ballot law
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
commission in regards
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the examination and approval of any
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
machines used i know my community did
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
not vote
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the counting devices i
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
will say that the warren article as
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
presented was changed at the
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
deliberative session but the warren
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
article as presented i thought was still
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
clear as to what it was asking
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i am not being dismissive of people's
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
concerns when i vote for this but i am
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
being cognizant of the issue that our
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the power to
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
legislate this themselves and that the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission has been tasked by
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
statute to address the issue for the
 
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.310 align:start position:0%
statute to address the issue for the
state

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would like to add to that
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be addressing this
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
in two
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming up one of them uh
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses overvotes and
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
will require that any uh ballot that
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
contains an overvote will be kicked back
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
by the machine and the voter then will
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
place it in a separate box to be hand
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
counted so i think that deals with the
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
primary issue that we've that we've seen
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to the machines and
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then a second bill we're going to be
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
requires that on any recount that is
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
done on a
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
lower ballot race in a statewide
 
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.870 align:start position:0%
lower ballot race in a statewide
election

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh will also include a recount of one of
 
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.549 align:start position:0%
uh will also include a recount of one of
the

00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
top of ballot races and i think that
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
again just adds some more
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh some checks some safety checks and
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with the issues at hand
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
although representative growing you're
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
not presuming what the outcome of any
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
vote might be in this committee are you
 
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
vote might be in this committee are you
probably

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
the vote carries 20 to zero
 
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.549 align:start position:0%
the vote carries 20 to zero
um

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
let me ask the consensus do you think
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
this should go on the consent or just
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
put it on the regular calendar
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
consent okay
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
without objection 1064 will go on
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
consent the next bill again trying to
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
proceed numerically because that's
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately how your chair got
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
organized instead of how the notice went
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
is 1163.
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
we received an amendment in committee
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing of 741
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
from representative porter the prime
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and i'm looking to
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
see if that was one of the ones that got
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
printed out
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
does anybody know offhand
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
because that's it's the top one all
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
right um 1163
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
um as introduced required that ballots
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
containing overvotes be returned to the
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
voter for possible correction
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh required the number of overvoted
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
ballots and and under votes and that
 
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
ballots and and under votes and that
um

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment presented that
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
removed the requirement to provide the
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct over votes that
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
is that direct interaction with somebody
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
else handling the ballot
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
and the amendment provides that
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballots are to be hand counted
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
after the polls close the public hearing
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
on this was
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
in february on the 23rd
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
is there a motion on 1163
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative lane
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
i have a motion to
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
2020-0741 h is there a second
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i second it
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the motion has been seconded would you
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
addressed concerns that were raised in
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
the by the secretary of state as to the
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
and regarding the fact that it created
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters and so the
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is designed to
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that had been
 
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.830 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that had been
raised

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
and i think we had a very
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
for me illustrative
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
presentation by representative
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
porter so
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
on the amendment which is now before the
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee for 1163 amendment number 741
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
where i'm joined i don't think i have a
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment representative
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to take care of him
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
that means we can blame you for the rest
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay i have a question representative
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
barry so i don't even know the
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
the concern i raised in committee
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
was that
a

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the machine spits out spits the ballot
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
back out
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
and we don't actually know why it spits
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
it out it could spit it out for a
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
the testimony was actually that the
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
ballot county machine would register as
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
an overvote rejection
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay so it would display it over vote
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
rejection that's my understanding and
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
then it would be handed back to the
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
voter who would then put it into a box
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
there should be no reason for the person
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
at the box to even handle the ballot if
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
when they get kicked back out as a
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i was behind somebody
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday it go it
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
it comes right back to you in front of
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
the in front of the box okay so there
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
should be no reason for anybody else to
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
handle it so the voter would the voter
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
would take that and then put it in the
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
other box right and that's it still
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't address my concern of this voter
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be upset that
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
there's this they're going to be like
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
why is my ballot getting put into
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
another box and they're like well you'll
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
vote they're gonna say well can i fix it
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
and what are we gonna tell them
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
a voter always has the opportunity to
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
fix a ballot you can have up to three
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
spoiled ballots at any election
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
and everybody working the polls should
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
know that so how does this not create
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to a hand count town is
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
versus a machine counter correct
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's the question it's my
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
my number my number one and two issues
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
from the beginning is is
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters i i've always
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
opposed that in every form
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and the second one is is
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're creating
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's no it goes back to the balance
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
so you've either created a second class
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
of voter or you're creating a conflict
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
between the voter and whoever is this
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
the person standing there
 
00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
the person standing there
reject

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
reject
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
saying saying it to put you back you
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
know if i'm that voter right recently my
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
ballot comes back and it's over voted
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm fixing it right which is fine i
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
probably like that's fine but once again
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
we have the two classes of voters
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
problems here right because people in
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
hand count town don't don't get that
 
00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
hand count town don't don't get that
luxury

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
luxury
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering how is this
 
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering how is this
addressing

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't it doesn't seem to be
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
addressing that that's why with the
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office i ask can we
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
bring the diverters back because i don't
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the overvotes being
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
hand counted and it's fine that's the
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
same class of voter
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
but we're now creating
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
one voter in a machine count town gets
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to fix their ballot
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
and a voter in a hand count town does
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
not that's two classes of voters
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
i've i've never supported that in any
 
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
i've i've never supported that in any
form

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
i've done that for college students for
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything i've said
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
there's one there's one voter there's a
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voter we have to try to
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
treat them all as equally as possible so
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
can somebody answer that like how does
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
this fix that representative bergeron
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
um i would note that the accu vote
 
00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:28.549 align:start position:0%
um i would note that the accu vote
tabulators

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
tabulators
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
can reject the ballot for multiple
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
reasons it's not just the overvote
 
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.789 align:start position:0%
reasons it's not just the overvote
situation

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
if for example this coding that
 
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.630 align:start position:0%
if for example this coding that
distinguishes

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
distinguishes
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
award one ballot from a ward 2 ballot
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
and if everything on it is exactly the
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
same it doesn't matter if you try and
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
put award one ballot in ward 2 machine
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
is going to get kicked out
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
if there's been a cutting error and the
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
bar coding around the ballot wasn't cut
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
properly it will get kicked out if there
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
was baby drool on the ballot and got a
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
little soggy it's going to get kicked
 
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.710 align:start position:0%
little soggy it's going to get kicked
out

00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
or jam the machine
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
my point is that as long as the election
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
official isn't specifying why the ballot
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
is being kicked out in most cases they
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
won't be able to
 
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
won't be able to
um

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's just an automatic procedure
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the person to put it in the the side
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
slot or the auxiliary compartment
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
so that it can be hand counted at the
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
end of the night
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
now if the voter himself or herself were
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
to say can i look at my ballot then
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a right that any voter
 
00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a right that any voter
has

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
has
so

00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
i i feel that
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
voters are being treated the same under
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
the scenario that has been created with
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the original bill i
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
so that sounds fine with me what you
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
just described if we're not saying if
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
the person's saying they're saying oh
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
your ballot was kicked out for x y or z
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
if if the person's standing there just
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
says the machine didn't want to read
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
your ballot on the first pass you can
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
try to put it in you can put it over
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
there i'm fine with that but what i
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't like is somebody saying well you
 
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.029 align:start position:0%
don't like is somebody saying well you
know

00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
let me look at this and figure out why
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's kicking it out right that that i
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
don't like um so if it's just the
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
if the intent of the legislator here and
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
i can get behind the intent if the
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
intent is just saying hey the machine
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
didn't read this for whatever reason one
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
of which could be an overrode if the
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
machine can't babies rule whatever
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to put it over here
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine because i don't think
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
that'll create a conflict between
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
the voter and that that
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
poll worker that vote let's call
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer right um
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
if that's what we're doing if we're if
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's as the chairman suggests it's gonna
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know flash on the screen overvote
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna hand the ballot back
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
well that is two classes
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
so what what are we doing
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
let me ask
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
i thought we talked about overvote on
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the machine but is that only if it
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
accepted the ballot and didn't reject it
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes and i think mary tillman the
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
memory cards currently are programmed to
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
accept over voted uh ballots
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so even if there's an overvote the
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
machine will will accept it and
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
it just won't count for that race but
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
they can be programmed
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
to kick it out if there's an overvote
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
and it can i can't say it with 100
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
certainty but 99 percent certainty
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to display
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
overvote they can just say rejected
 
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.669 align:start position:0%
overvote they can just say rejected
so

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your your
 
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your your
question

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.349 align:start position:0%
question
but

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
it part of it is to do with the
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
programming and whether it's going to
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
get kicked out or not
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
i'm so i'm i'm totally fine with it
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting kicked out
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's the it's that second that creating
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
that second class of voter that i don't
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
like if it's if if they're just gonna if
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
the machine just rejects it for whatever
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
reason right let's not even say it's no
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
but it's just a rejected ballot right
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's for whatever reason it's bouncing
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
back one of which we are now including
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
is an overvote
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we're just taking that ballot and
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
putting it into a hand count box i'm
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
totally cool
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
not not a problem all in for that it's
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
if it's if if the machine is going to be
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
programmed to say this is an overvote
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
then then we're going to create that
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
conflict right
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
or we're going to create two classes of
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
voters neither which i like so if if the
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
legislative intent if we're going to if
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to get down and you know
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is when they're looking at this in
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
the future if they're going to say all
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
right the legislative intent was not to
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
create two classes of voters i'm voting
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
for this if we are going to
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
inadvertently create two classes of
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
voters i have opposed that on everything
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
that we have done and i'll vote against
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
it so i'm just trying to figure out what
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
exactly we're doing if that's the intent
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
i'm all in but all right the chair is
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
going to say that she
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
apologizes because she might have
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
created more confusion as to whether the
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
overvote shows up on the screen but it's
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the secretary of
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
state's office has been very consistent
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
in their opposition to this bill in the
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
past because it does create two classes
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
of voters and deals with the privacy of
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
the voter and that they were not opposed
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
to this amendment because they felt it
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
was sufficiently addressed
 
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.790 align:start position:0%
was sufficiently addressed
so

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with the programming
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
of the machines as i probably should be
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
or representative bergeron but i do know
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
that that was the position of the
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state representative lane
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you to address representative
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
barry's point i think representative
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
porter worked with the secretary of
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
state because the intent was not to
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
create the two classes and
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
she explained that it would just be put
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
into the box that the person wouldn't
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
even be wouldn't even see the ballot
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
hand it back and just or put it back and
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
put it in the auxiliary
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i is she i mean that was her
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendment
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
which is 7 41.
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i i share some of these same
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and but i also see what rep
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
porter was trying to do and i i
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
commend that
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm looking at the amendment here
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it says the auxiliary
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
shall be placed in the auxiliary
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
compartment by the moderator or his or
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
her appointee to be counted after the
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
polls close
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
but at the same time you have to explain
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the voter that they have the chance
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
to and it doesn't
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
get into this in the amendment that you
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
have to explain to the voter that they
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
have the chance to revoke if they want
 
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.470 align:start position:0%
have the chance to revoke if they want
to

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of voters if they're
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
already confused and and
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
are over voting then having to explain
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
the overvoting situation to them
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
will be very
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
difficult and cumbersome
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the moment
 
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
in the moment
of

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about this this
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
so um first of all i just want to
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
correct the the
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
sentence that you just read
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
just has to do with absentee ballots
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
then placed in there by the moderator
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
the previous sentence says the voters
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
shall be instructed to place the ballot
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
in an axillary compartment to be hand
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
counted so the voters handling the
 
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
counted so the voters handling the
ballot

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative barry
 
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.710 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative barry
that

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
the intent and i'm hearing this from
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
everyone that the intent of this is that
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're not creating two classes of voters
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
and i think
that

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
the voter should simply be told the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
machine is not reading your vote
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
correctly and it's being placed in a box
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the auxiliary box to be hand counted
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
anything more than that is just going to
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
create confusion because i have to admit
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair that i did not know what
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
over voted ballots were i i thought i
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
did but i didn't fully understand over
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
voted ballots until i served on this
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee and i would dare say that 90
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
or 95 percent of the voters in the state
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means and if we
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
tried to explain that to them on
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
election day
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
bergeron i would just uh
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will be this will
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
certainly be my last comment uh the
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
secretary of secretary of state
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
publishes about a 300 page election
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
procedures manual
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
every two years which outlines
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
good practices best practices
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
policies procedures to
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
put into effect the intent of law
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to that they run training
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
sessions prior to elections throughout
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh so that election officials can get
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
updated on some of the changes both to
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
law and to procedures they do training
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
sessions at the city and town clerks
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
association every year at their annual
 
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
association every year at their annual
meeting

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
i have full confidence that the
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:32.550 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
will

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
put into effect whatever needs to be
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
done to ensure that the intent of
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation the intent of this
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee and the the
 
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
committee and the the
uh

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the secretary of
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
state's office has with the bill's
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor to make sure that there aren't
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
two-tiers double-standard approaches to
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
counting ballots so i have full
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in the secretary of state in
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i would just
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
add that this bill had been proposed

the way it was described to us during

the hearing is that it would just be

handed back to the voter and said please

put it in the auxiliary box
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
no mention of why it's being rejected
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
you address that
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
was that was addressed so they would not
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity unless they took
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
it and realized oh my god you know but
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%

modify the language in the law
 
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.829 align:start position:0%
modify the language in the law
that

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
deals with sb 3 that was passed in 2017
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that the supreme court subsequently
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
ruled unconstitutional
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
and it also restores language that
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is retains
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
some of the language of sb3 that the
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
court did not address and did not see as
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
apparently did not see as problematic um
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.430 align:start position:0%
apparently did not see as problematic um
and

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
that language some of the the things
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
that were retained it it keeps in 654 2
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
1 and 2 the
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
a clear definition of temporary presence
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
and absence it retains language that
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
requires the supervisor of the checklist
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
to follow up on persons who have
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
utilized the voter affidavit to register
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
using available public records records
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then to refer the registrant's
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
information to the secretary of state if
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
further investigation is warranted
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
and it retains language that keeps the
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
distinction between voters who register
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
prior to 30 days before an election and
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
those who register 30 days or less
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
before an election but it does
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
some modification to that and that it
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
does allow
 
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.230 align:start position:0%
does allow
for

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.349 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
a the use of a
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
of an affidavit
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
registrant who
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
the required documentation and can i
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
cannot obtain that documentation and an
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
example of that would be a person who's
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
homeless and just simply cannot come up
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
with that documentation to prove that he
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
or she is a resident so those are the
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
primary changes in the amendment and i
 
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
primary changes in the amendment and i
urge

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
urge
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to support
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment 962 which is
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor representative bergeron
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh well i appreciate the uh effort that
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the amendment has put
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
into this to try
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
and remove some of the issues which the
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court said
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
were essentially unconstitutional
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
including the harsh penalties that were
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
provided in the original senate bill 3
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
i would point out that the secretary of
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
state during his testimony on the
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
said that there really needed to be a
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
lot of work put into the language that
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
put into law it needed to be cleaned up
 
00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
put into law it needed to be cleaned up
and

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's still more work to be done here
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
for example in the supreme court
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
decision the court found faults with a
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
two-tiered registration system that's a
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
voter registration system where there's
 
00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:30.549 align:start position:0%
voter registration system where there's
a

00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
form for everybody who registers to vote
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
31 days or more prior to an election in
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
a different form
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
for those who are registering to vote
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of an election
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the court pointed out that the
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
two-tiered registration system no longer
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
functions as it's no longer an affidavit
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
to submit within 30 days of an election
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
well the only difference i could see in
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment between the two
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
voter registration forms is a paragraph
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
that says i understand that to make the
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
address i have vented above from my
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
domicile for voting i must have an
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
intent to make this the one place from
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
which i participate in democratic
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
self-government and must have acted to
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
carry out that intent
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that clause must have
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
acted to carry out that intent really
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
means because there's really no
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
definitions as to what constitutes proof
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
of prior actions to have carried out
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
that intent
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
in short i i
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort that's been put
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
into uh amending sections of the
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
statutes but i think there's still more
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
and i would rather see that we have an
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vet the language in this
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in more detail um and not pass
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
it on on
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.710 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
growing

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
growing
um

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated matter i
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
think we all realize that there's been
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
many many hours hundreds of hours of
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
work have gone into this in the past in
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
sb3 and
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm sure in in drafting hb 1203
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
originally and now i'm looking at the
 
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
originally and now i'm looking at the
amendment

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
i do not claim perfection on this
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment but i also am committed to
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
work with the senate
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
win i hope this goes forward to the
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
senate and we can address
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
i'll say i'm not sure i agree with
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's interpretation
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the 30-day issue and what the impact
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
was in sb3 as compared to this amendment
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
i do think it's important that something
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
because i think we had testimony from
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
people at public hearing who had
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
obviously put a great deal of effort
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
into looking at the statute and
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
proposing something and the part of the
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
statute they were working on
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
was no longer being enforced because of
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
the court ruling so i think it's
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
important we get that out i think it's
 
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.870 align:start position:0%
important we get that out i think it's
unfortunate

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the amendment attempted to do more
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
than just repeal it
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
which made
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
i think for representative growing it
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
more difficult to go through to
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
determine how to put things back to
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
where it was before sp3
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
and what
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
might make sense to retain so
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
i want to thank representative growing
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
and while there might be some changes
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
that might make some sense i think for
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
the house at this process this amendment
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
is a good thing for the public
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%

morning is 12 47

that is relative to
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
folded ballots this requires that any
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
political subdivision that uses
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
if it has been folded is to be hand
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
counted after the close of polls
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative teresian
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a lot this year about um
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.630 align:start position:0%
problems with
um

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
folded ballots and
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
the possibility of them not being
 
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
the possibility of them not being
counted

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
i i know that
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
we like to talk about wyndham so i'm
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
bringing up again that um
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in their case it ended up being that
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't fold the ballot correctly
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
but i did talk to my uh town clerk and
 
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.230 align:start position:0%
but i did talk to my uh town clerk and
um

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
moderator and and others that have told
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
me that
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
it sometimes happens it's more likely
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
folded ballot than
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
one that's not folded
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
so in light of that i i think this
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is a common sense way to
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
have another
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
way to ensure that everybody's vote
 
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.589 align:start position:0%
way to ensure that everybody's vote
counts

00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
counts
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i think it's prudent
 
00:55:38.319 --> 00:55:39.910 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i think it's prudent
to

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
pass this bill to ensure that
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
in most cases the folded ballots are
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
ones that are
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that these will be hand
 
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.910 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that these will be hand
counted

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair

hamer
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question here
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bill requires that any ballot that's
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
been folded to be held hand counting
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
after the polls close
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is inviting problems
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against this bill
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
holding marked ballots which are folded
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
is just another way for ballots to get
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
overlooked or misplaced at the end of
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
the evening
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
hand counting done by already overworked
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
election workers after the polls close
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
will add four to five hours to their
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
14-hour day
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
and to expect to get an accurate outcome
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
this seems to undermine the very
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
argument of election integrity
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i'll be voting against
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you i
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
would just like to
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
add to the representatives comments to
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
get the committee under this understand
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
the scale that we're talking about in
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
the november 2020 election
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
there were 260 000 absentee ballots cast
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
and under this law all of those would
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
have to be hand counted there were
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
554 000 regular election day ballots
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
cast so this means that theoretically
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
about a third of all ballots would have
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
to be hand counted i think that's just a
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
scale that's very difficult for our
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
election officials to have to absorb and
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
be responsible for so i'll be voting
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
against the uh
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative derozan thank you madam

chair
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
2020 was a very extraordinary year and
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee ballots was was
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
off the charts
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'll use my town
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
election yesterday
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
out of about five well
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
there's five thousand registered voters
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
we had just under two thousand votes
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
cast and there was a little under 200
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so in most cases in
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the percentage of absentee ballots
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
is a relatively small number
 
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
is a relatively small number
and

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
the um those ballots are already handled
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh when they come in by the nature of
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that mailed back in that
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
they're being handled we did have a
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
write-in candidate um that did quite
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
well yesterday
 
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.910 align:start position:0%
well yesterday
and

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
i i was
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
observer there and saw that the ballots
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
were counted um
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
what appeared to be accurately fairly
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly quite efficiently so
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
again this is a this is another way to
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that that we don't miss any votes
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative prude homer brian
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i should
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
talk about this since in my community
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
yesterday the moderator chose to hand
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
count all the
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots on her own even though
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
she was not required to do so she did it
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
because she felt it would
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
be a good idea
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
in light of what happened in windham
 
00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.549 align:start position:0%
in light of what happened in windham
i

00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
i saw that it increased the time by
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
about two to two and a half hours to
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
count the to get the the results
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that was not a plus needless to say
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
as a candidate waiting for results for
 
00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:20.950 align:start position:0%
as a candidate waiting for results for
myself

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
but if it does make people
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
more confident in the elections then i
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
am in favor of it and we can and we can
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
work up to it when we see how many
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are coming we can work
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
up to it as as communities and increase
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.670 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
hamer

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's towns this is city
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
manchester is a city and we have
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
over four four to five hours extra work
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
for our already overworked volunteers
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
if we do this hand counting that is if
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
we put the ballots aside and they don't
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
get lost or misplaced
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm against this thank you
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald yes madam
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
chairman wouldn't it be a local option
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of them being able to do this
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
i think as representative prudhomme
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
o'brien indicated it is always up to the
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
moderator as to how to count the ballots
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
even if a town is using electronic
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
battle counting machines
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is up to the moderator to decide that
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding for example if
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
machines break down and they have to
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
hand count them that will be what the
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
moderator has to do
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
this is uh going to be a rare moment for
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
me i i will be voting no on this
 
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.349 align:start position:0%
me i i will be voting no on this
legislation

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
i totally understand the intent and the
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
drive behind it i think other
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have worked on and
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
have dealt with already this session uh
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
deals with the wyndham issue that we saw
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
with the folded ballots that were caused
 
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.069 align:start position:0%
with the folded ballots that were caused
there

01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh the issue with the folds there um and
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
and representative o'brien your
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
testimony in your statement actually
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
put me into the column where moderators
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and local election officials can already
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
decide to count folded ballots
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
separately from the machine count
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
i say we leave it up to those local
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
officials and not get in their way of
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing their job so i'll be voting no on
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
this motion thank you representative
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's sure they can make that a
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
decision but
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
i'll use wyndham again
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what the problem was so
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
if those votes are never counted and it
 
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.750 align:start position:0%
if those votes are never counted and it
doesn't

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is not an anomaly detected they
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
won't be counted and they wouldn't have
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
been counted if we hadn't had an
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
audit into that so that
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
again it reinforces my
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney moves inexpedient
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
to legislate is there a second yes ma'am
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
try a second then representative berry
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
seconds it would one of you like to
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair unfortunately
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes sponsors bring forth
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to this body that's just not
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
and so but more seriously
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
this legislation we've talked with a lot
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
of other pieces of legislation
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i find that we've already addressed
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation so
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's why i would find this an
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion on the
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
motion the motion is to recommend 1383
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
as an expedient to legislate
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
chair i'll be supporting the motion to
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
find this inexpedient to legislate
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
in part because the secretary of state's
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
office notified us that they're having
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
vendor issues right now and being able
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
to generate these reports and there was
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
no guarantee that they're going to be
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
able to have that fixed in time for the
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
fall elections so i'll be supporting the
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%

01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh just for the record i believe
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment we're talking about is
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
number zero nine six seven h because i
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that number was cited yet
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
i apologize thank you that's right and
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
if i may i'm gonna support the amendment
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
actually i think it's a very good one um
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
i am a certified archivist i've had
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
considerable training in records
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
management and what this amendment does
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
basically is require that the
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
the clerks maintain a records
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
disposition log and and
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
good records management procedures say
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
if you're destroying records you should
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
make a note or log when it was destroyed
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
and what was destroyed so if at any time
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
someone wants to pull a record you're
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
not looking for something that that
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't exist anymore because
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's been disposed of so this creates
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
the record that the good man records
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
management practices uh would normally
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
require anyway and i think it's very
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
simple to uh
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
to comply with so i i think it's a good
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and i think it uh
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
helps put a little more integrity into
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
the whole process
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%

this bill as proposed 1467 is a is a
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
simple common sense
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill that um
 
01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
bill that um
asks

01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
asks
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh for recounts in the top of the ballot
 
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.430 align:start position:0%
uh for recounts in the top of the ballot
races

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
races
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
each time there's a recount in one of
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the lower ballot races typically the
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
state rep races which are the most
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
commonly recounted typically the in in
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
an election there are 15 to 20
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
state rep races that are recounted and
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that um
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
one or two of the upper ballot races be
 
01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
one or two of the upper ballot races be
recounted

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
recounted
 
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.229 align:start position:0%
recounted
with

01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
each time that a a stat rap race state
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
rep races is recounted
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions of the original
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
was discussed in hearing and i found
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
troublesome was allowing the candidate
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
who was applying for the recount to
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
select any other office
 
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
select any other office
involved

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be recounted as well
 
01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
to be recounted as well
and

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
i felt and i believe this was testified
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
to in the hearing that this would
 
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
to in the hearing that this would
encourage

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
candidates who
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
probably were within the one percent
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
allowance to be recounted but otherwise
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ask for a recount just to ask
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
for recount
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
a recount in an upper race so the
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
amendment removes that provision
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
it also instead of
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
specifying that the secretary of state
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.709 align:start position:0%
specifying that the secretary of state
would

01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
would specify one race
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be recounted one of the upper ballot
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
races to be recounted let's say for
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
governor or for executive council that
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
that would then be the race that was
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
recounted throughout the amendment
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
changes that and says that for each
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent recount a different one of
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
those upper five
 
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.270 align:start position:0%
those upper five
races

01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
races
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be recounted so that if there were
 
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.390 align:start position:0%
would be recounted so that if there were
15

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.590 align:start position:0%
15
recounts

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
three recounts of each of the upper
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
ballot races now
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
in in the last
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 years we have had very few of
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
any recounts in in many of these upper
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
ballot races and i think it is just
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
really good practice to have some
 
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
really good practice to have some
regular

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
recounts of the upper ballot races and
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it is going to be pretty random
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
because we never know
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
where the state rep races are that are
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
going to be recounted so i think i think
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
this is a is a common sense bill and i i
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
ask for your support for this amendment
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.750 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
first let me
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
qualify what i'm about to say after i
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
i fully support some kind of audit
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
process here in the state of new
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire there are more than 40 states
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the country that have some kind of
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
post-election audit procedure in place
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're quite
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
different you know some have traditional
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
post-election audits some use something
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
called a risk-limiting audit
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
audit procedural audits post-election
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
audits under certain circumstances
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different approaches
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
to conducting post-election audits
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
we had a bill before us last session
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
which was a little more detailed
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
than what's being presented today
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
524 and we retained that bill because
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
par and part of the argument for doing
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
so was that it was a very complex issue
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways to go about
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
conducting post-election audits and it
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
really need needed further studies so
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we could find the right type of
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
approach that would work best for new
 
01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
approach that would work best for new
hampshire

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
i am going to oppose this for the same
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that the committee decided to
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
send house bill 524
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
to retain it last session
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that perhaps
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
representatives from both parties might
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
put our heads together prior to the next
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
session and come up with a more
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive detailed bill
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
that will get new hampshire a good
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
post-election audit procedure that
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
everybody including the secretary of
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative groen
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
does not call for an audit uh there's a
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
distinct difference between an audit and
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
a recount
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple and and i i
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
neglected to say that the amendment also
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh changes the
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
the description in line five instead of
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
saying audit of additional offices it
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
says recount of additional offices and
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the intent is that this is a simple
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
recount it's can be very simply done
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
each time that there is a recount
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
every single ballot is handled so at
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
this point the people who are recounting
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
are counting two races instead of one or
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
three races instead of one it's a very
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
simple bill it's not an audit it's just
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
a simple procedure to do a simple spot
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
check on the accuracy of our counts
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative lane
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um did i
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that the word
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
audit had been changed in the amendment
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
to recount
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes it has but what i'm realizing is
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
that ols didn't relabel what it called
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
the new section and that won't go into
 
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.950 align:start position:0%
the new section and that won't go into
statute

01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
oh no i i see look at line six
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative growing representative
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
ward was that what you were going to say
 
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
ward was that what you were going to say
yeah

01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
and eight as well it says audited
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair go ahead representative
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
when when i changed in line five it says
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
recount that had previously said audit
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i realized last night that i
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
neglected to change the word audit in
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the in the two following references and
 
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.629 align:start position:0%
the in the two following references and
i

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
i will either
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to the floor for this
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
um what i would prefer to do is deal
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
with this when it goes to hopefully when
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
it goes to the senate and ask that the
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
senate change those words to recount
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
because the intent is this is a simple
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on please
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
do you know madam sheriff would be
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
permissible to move to amend the
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendment in this
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
forum i think technically what we used
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
to do was run across the street and
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually bring the amendment over and
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
stand there and wait for it
 
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.870 align:start position:0%
stand there and wait for it
um

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we can send an email
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.030 align:start position:0%

01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
my chairman i'm happy to send the email
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
over right now and we can can we come
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
back to it at the end of this executive
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
session yeah why don't we if
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry you are quicker on
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron might i suggest
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
if the amendment's being drafted that
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill also be changed
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
so lines three
 
01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
so lines three
six

01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
and eight
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
audit should either be removed or if
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate recount should be inserted
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then the title as well instead of
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
saying requiring partial audits right or
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
you should be just saying that would be
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
correct right
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
all right so representative berry thank
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
you very much for
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
contacting ols and put the little flag
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
on it for high priority
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i will just note to representative
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
bergeron's comments
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
um i will be asking for members who are
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
interested in working on an audit bill
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be doing so after crossover we have a
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill coming over
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that provides for an audit for the 2020
 
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
that provides for an audit for the 2020
election

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so i will be looking for people to
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at that um just given the
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
calendar in this subject it was not
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
something i could put on the plate for
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
the first couple of months of session
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that that is going to
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
have to that i will be asking for people
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
to address in a subcommittee when we get
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to move on from
 
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.550 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to move on from
1467.

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
1467.
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
somebody make sure i don't forget it
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
please and the next bill numerically
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be considered this morning is 1470
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is requiring that all ballot
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
counting devices show the number of
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
overvotes uh for each race on the ballot
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing on this
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
on february 20th
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
is there a motion representative
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
terezian madam chair
 
01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
terezian madam chair
i

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
to find house bill 1470 fn in expediting
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the legislate
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded by
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron representative
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
teresian would you like to speak to your
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
initially upon reading this
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
bill i thought it was a good idea but
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
after learning that
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
overvotes don't register in the machine
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
although i think i heard something a
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
little contradictory earlier today
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
but for the most part
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
it accomplishes nothing if it if if an
 
01:24:18.159 --> 01:24:19.350 align:start position:0%
it accomplishes nothing if it if if an
overvote

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
overvote
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up on the tape
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you really can do with
 
01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.149 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you really can do with
this

01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
we learned there's a difference between
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
overvotes and blanks

01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's been much discussion uh in this
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee over these over this course of
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
this term about audits
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
many bills we've we've considered some
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've recommended
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
this one i believe has some potential
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's a much more limited limited in
 
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.990 align:start position:0%
it's a much more limited limited in
scope

01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
scope
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
for example than the one we considered
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
and we recommended itl that would have
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
required a statewide audit this is a
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
more focused and limited one
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i think it has potential but i do
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
think it requires more study before we
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh we pass it
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion on the
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
we just want to make that clear again
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
and actually there was a few moments
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
here this morning where that statement
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
really was true right so there you go
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes i don't know
 
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.149 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes i don't know
anyway

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.030 align:start position:0%
that's right
um

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
but we do think the bill needs i good
 
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.030 align:start position:0%
but we do think the bill needs i good
grief

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
grief
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think the bill needs a lot of work and
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
work on that with
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
either representative mcdonald or
 
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.790 align:start position:0%
either representative mcdonald or
whomever

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
whomever
and

01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:45.669 align:start position:0%
and
we

01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do note that
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
mir i am from mayor i represent
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
merrimack county and i have to say i
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting that it was
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
picked because there were no fraud or
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
any issues brought up in any of the
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
towns in merrimack county and i noted
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that none of the sponsors are from
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
 
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.229 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
so

01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like to understand why
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
merrimack county was picked
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%

chairman i would like to move 1485 as an
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and i would like
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to my motion is there a second
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'll second that
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron second set you
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
recognize to speak to your motion
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative barry you know i'm
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
chairman there's times in the
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
legislative process where sometimes a
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor brings forward a bill that's not
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
and needs a lot of work and i think this
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
is one of those cases and i think the
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor is well intended but you know
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
this is just not ready so um with that i
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
moved to any speed legislate
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%

oh sorry representative did you want to

say something i did just want to note
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair if it'd be okay that i had
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually prepared a 55-minute lecture
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
um in opposition to the previous bill
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm prepared to give it if anyone would
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
like to listen
 
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
like to listen
[Laughter]

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we should develop like a cle
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
process where we can all lecture each
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
other on a particular topic and pass out
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
certificates of the election law
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
committee for endurance how's that all
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
right so 1485 has been
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
voted inexpedient to legislate 20-0
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
without objection that will go on
 
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.430 align:start position:0%
without objection that will go on
consent

01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the next bill numerically to be
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
addressed this morning is 1522 1522
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
is requiring the use of ballots with
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
embedded security in relative to the
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
chain of custody of absentee ballots
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing on this on
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
january 20th is there a motion on 1522.
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman i'd move in expedient
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
to legislate is there a second i'll
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
second it madam chair representative
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
bergeron has seconded representative
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
mcdonald would you like to speak to your
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
motion yes i would madam chairman
 
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.669 align:start position:0%
motion yes i would madam chairman
again

01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
all of us are concerned about election
 
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.470 align:start position:0%
all of us are concerned about election
integrity

01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
we have different you know ways we want
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
to get there but we all have
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about that this bill at this
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
point in time would appear to be very
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
onerous to be in terms of implementation
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
the testing and the validation
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
of the ballots and um for that reason i
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're there yet and i
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
moved and expedient to legislate
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
their further discussion on it
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
um i i concur with what representative
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's said i i would just add that
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
my primary reason for not supporting the
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill is the decentralization of the
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
printing of ballots
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's a real concern the secretary of
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
state's office pays for the ballots
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
they know how many need to be ordered
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
based on projections of turnout uh
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're able to do the quality control
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
and ensure the ballots are being
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
printed and shipped in in a manner that
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of all towns and cities
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so i think this
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
would actually create more problems
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
than than would hopefully solve so i i
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
will support the motion
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i agree with
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
the representative bergeron on the um
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
decentralization of of the purchases i
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
think that just introduces problems i do
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to add
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
support the idea of having of using the
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
available technologies to make sure that
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
the ballots are printed on on secure
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
paper that can't be duplicated uh and i
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's for another time but that
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
was only one part of this bill and and
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
much of it was just simply
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't believe was
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to pass
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
teresian thank you madam chair
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
i um i agree with what the las
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative just said um
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
i like
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
some of the aspects of this bill um i
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't think the technology's there yet
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
for embedded security but uh i hope
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
someday we do go to this and i hope it
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later when the
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
technology is available
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill i just
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
want to make a comment on the technology
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state's office did
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
reach out to a vendor in regards to
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
secure ballots and there was a
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
demonstration done that i had the
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
and it was really a slide presentation
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to what they could do
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
and what it was was dna in the ink
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
where each the ink would have encoded
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
synthetic dna i need to tell you that i
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
sat through half of the presentation
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how we would pick which
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislators dna we were going to put on
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
the ballot but then they told me it was
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
going to be synthetic and i was actually
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
a little disappointed
 
01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.030 align:start position:0%
a little disappointed
um

01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
so the the ink actually has a dna put on
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
it and the ballot itself gets like a
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
infrared marking on it the polling place
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
would be given a special pen
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
that can pick up the stamp that is
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
placed on the ballot to verify
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
that the ballot was one that was issued
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the security that had
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
been placed on the ballot and if there
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
was any question on whether the ballot
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
was good you would then test the ink on
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
the test of the ink is not immediate
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
it is weeks
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
and it in fact is a pcr test similar to
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
what is used for covid testing and we
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
all know how excited and how we all
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
agree on that process
 
01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
agree on that process
so

01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
um it was interesting for the technology
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's out there and that it's available
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
i will tell you i also went to another
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
presentation that was available to
 
01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.709 align:start position:0%
presentation that was available to
legislators

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
on the state-of-the-art security
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh for balloting and the reality is they
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
were just a
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
general reference to secure paper and i
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
just explained to you what a secure
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
paper methodology would be i don't think
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's workable at this point in time
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
and as far as the security of it what
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
was presented in that particular thing
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
was really cameras
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on all ballots at all
 
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.629 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on all ballots at all
times

01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
times
um

01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i won't get into where the cameras
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
are coming from or that kind of thing
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the reality is is that
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
for the the actual polling place
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
to make a determination that a
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
ballot presented is not appropriate at
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
this point to be able to do it
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
immediately with a hundred percent
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
confidence doesn't sound like it's there
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
so just so everybody is aware those kind
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
of inquiries are ongoing
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to what can be do done for
 
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
in regards to what can be do done for
security

01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%

01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%

01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
the the original bill would require that
 
01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:55.350 align:start position:0%
the the original bill would require that
the

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.629 align:start position:0%
the
clerks

01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
scan the accu vote
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
totals tapes at the end of the night
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
submit them to the those scans to the
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
secretary of state the secretary of
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
state would then have to create
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet documents
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
itemizing all the data
 
01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.709 align:start position:0%
itemizing all the data
and

01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
part of the testimony was that it only
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
takes a few minutes
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from my experience that a
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:20.790 align:start position:0%
lot of
what

01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
is done at the end of an election just
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
takes a few minutes
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean i'm not still
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to be out there delivering returns
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh state police barracks uh at two or
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
three in the morning because there are
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
just so many tasks to to conclude
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
um i would also point out that these
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
tapes depending on you know whether it's
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
a primary or general election could be
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
up to three feet long maybe more
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
so the only way that the clerk's going
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to get it on their scanner is
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
to cut it up in pieces
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
and put it on their copier machine
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's usually what what the clerks use
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
for scanners and then i suppose they
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to criticism for
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
mutilating the tapes before they were
 
01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.189 align:start position:0%
mutilating the tapes before they were
scanned

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
scanned
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's necessary to go
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
through all this exercise in order to
 
01:41:05.119 --> 01:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
through all this exercise in order to
make

01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
the information that's on those tapes
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
available to the public if they want to
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:41:11.679 --> 01:41:12.870 align:start position:0%
see it
currently

01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the election procedure manual the
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state directs
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
the clerics to submit a long report tape
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state with the
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
return of votes so it's apparently
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
already being done although i can't say
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
that 100 of the clerks are compliant
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
that directive appears on page 94 and 95
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
of the election procedures manual
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
so what my amendment does is codify
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
that directive and require that the
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
clerks submit a copy of the tape to the
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state so now we'll know
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
that all these tapes will be available
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
in a centralized location if anybody
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
wants to examine them
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
statewide or from multiple towns it also
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
requires that a copy of that tape be
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
kept with the clerk's copy of the
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
official return of votes so if there was
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
someone that
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
is local and wants to see the the tape's
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
results uh there there are still
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
available they're retained
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
because right now it's just a working
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
document and there's no requirement that
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
the tape be retained once the official
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
returns are completed so i think this
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
amendment would address some of the
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
access issues that people raise during
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing without creating an

01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
moved in in expedient to legislate is
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
i second the motion madam chair
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian seconds it
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative hayward would you like to
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you madam
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
chair this is a
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
hp 1542 is one of multiple bills that
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly addresses voter
 
01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.709 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly addresses voter
identification

01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not function as
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
effectively as the others it introduces
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots and requires them to
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
be held separately
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
if counting later this will delay
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
results of the election unnecessarily
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
the intent is to eliminate the voter
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit completely and then introduces
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
an extensive administrative requirement
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
without a funding stream
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
and while policy should not
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
generally outweigh cost
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the minor any minor benefit added is not
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
worth while here
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's simply a bridge too far
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion representative
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
bergeron i'll be supporting the motion
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the secretary of state
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out to us it has pointed out to
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
us multiple times that provisional
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
balloting is unconstitutional under the
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution and further
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that if we go go down that route we're
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
probably opening up ourselves to having
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
to comply with the federal uh motor
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
voter acts and so i'll be i'll be

legislation did reference a number of
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
outdated statutes
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
and really just not ready for prime time
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
and there was no
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
representatives seeking to to really
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
work on
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
further amendments to it to get it in
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
line with current statute and existing
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
judgments so for that reason this bill
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
has been expedient to legislate but i do
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to thank the citizens that brought
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
this forward and got involved in the
 
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.470 align:start position:0%
this forward and got involved in the
process

01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%

set forward there's a hundreds of pages
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
of directions as to the conduct of
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
elections that is expected to be
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
followed issued by the secretary of

state

and the proponents wanted a registered
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
voter who basically has a dispute as to
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
the performance of duty be able to bring

problematic on a number of fronts
 
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
problematic on a number of fronts
um

02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
one we all have disagreements with how
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
people might be doing their job
 
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
occasionally whether they we think it's
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
adequate or not that doesn't mean it's
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily something subject to a suit
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
and nothing is resolved quickly in
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
superior court so even if it was subject
 
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
superior court so even if it was subject
to

02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
something that might be litigated it
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
would not resolve in any effective or
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
efficient manner it all the bill also
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
didn't propose that if a suit is
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
brought the election official will cease
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing their duties until the resolution
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
of the issue it really didn't
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
solve an issue and i will say that the
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
courts are not great about dismissing
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
things when you bring them if there's
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
insufficient allegations
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
on paper in the initial filing
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you motions to dismiss get
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
filed and basically judges say you know
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
we'll hear it and make a decision as to
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
whether the case is successful rather
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
than dismiss it without going forward
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
with an evidence so bringing suit in
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
superior court is nothing i would ever
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
wish on anybody
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
um however there is a frustration i have
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of other people that
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
nothing seems to be done when people are
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
not doing their jobs and i think the
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
windham election is an example of that
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are officials who swore under oath
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they did certain things and they
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
clearly did not and that was testimony
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
in front of the ballot law commission
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
there were processes that were supposed
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
to be followed that clearly were not
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
and windham has chosen to not um even
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
really discuss the findings of the audit
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
and the voters recently
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
just yesterday voted to keep the
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot system and i'm
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
assuming the same moderator has won
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
re-election i'm just sort of assuming
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
that but i don't know based on their
 
02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.069 align:start position:0%
that but i don't know based on their
action

02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
um so when i i spoke to the attorney
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
general's office about the frustration
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
with that and they said one of the
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
issues in regards to bringing a formal
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
um suit or action against an official is
 
02:11:48.239 --> 02:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
um suit or action against an official is
the

02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
the issue of intent as it needs to be
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
currently proven in the statute
 
02:11:54.079 --> 02:11:55.189 align:start position:0%
currently proven in the statute
um

02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
and so after some discussion about that
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
i took a look at the statute that was
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
proposed in this i thought turn this off
 
02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
and um so if you look at 663
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
666 3 relating to official misconduct
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
it deals with the chapter that is the
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
provisions for purity of elections
 
02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:20.270 align:start position:0%
provisions for purity of elections
and

02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
6661 has a general penalty
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
that relates to
 
02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
that relates to
unspecified

02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
unspecified
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
penalties are a violation and again
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
while a violation is technically not a
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
criminal offense it proceeds
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
in a very similar manner 666 2 deals
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
with what official malfeasance is
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
a number of standards about knowingly
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
doing certain things
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then 660 or fraudulently doing
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
anything and then 666 3 deals with
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
official mixed conduct with unknowingly
 
02:13:00.159 --> 02:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
official mixed conduct with unknowingly
standard

02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement of election laws in 666 8 is
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
dealt with the
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general's office
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
so what i'm seeking to do in this
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is to give the attorney
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
general's office as the enforcer an
 
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
general's office as the enforcer an
avenue

02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
avenue
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of misconduct as
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
that does not rise to a knowing standard
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
that would require a finding in a court
 
02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.629 align:start position:0%
that would require a finding in a court
so

02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
what i have proposed is to add to 6663
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
official mixed conduct to not change the
 
02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
official mixed conduct to not change the
current

02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
provision which relates to
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
a knowing failure to perform
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
and i am adding a provision for
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
and in connection with that
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
while it is the election officials
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oversee the election
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
the municipalities have some
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility i would argue in this
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
scheme of elections that we have
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we have local
 
02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we have local
elections

02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
our selectmen or selectmen in the cities
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
are in charge of the election
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
they are for entire districts and
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
elections occur not only as they did
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday throughout the state as a town
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
meeting but they also occur
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
specifically there might be a village
 
02:14:33.199 --> 02:14:34.870 align:start position:0%
specifically there might be a village
district

02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
or other political subdivision that has
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
an election throughout the state
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
and in discussion the question is how do
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
we get people's attention to the fact
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
that you might have people working who
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
are not doing what they're doing
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's the responsibility of
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
the community you're electing these
 
02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
the community you're electing these
officials

02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
other members of the community are
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
relying on you to be doing this
 
02:14:58.159 --> 02:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
relying on you to be doing this
correctly

02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion was to institute a
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
civil remedy
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
of a fine for the municipalities
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
because that's what's going to start to
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
get people's attention we think i think
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
people's attention is not
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
there and if you have a board of
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
selectmen who now has an attorney
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
general's letter that's 11 pages long
 
02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.430 align:start position:0%
general's letter that's 11 pages long
and

02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of it
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
they say there have been 25 instances
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
where we found that your officers did
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
not perform in accordance with the law
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
in a knowing fashion and accordingly we
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
are finding you 250 dollars for each of
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
those occurrences or a thousand dollars
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
for one occurrence or all of them
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think that will start to get people
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
attention as to what's going on
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns we just passed the
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
provision in regards to the storage of
 
02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
provision in regards to the storage of
ballots

02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure the towns pay
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
attention to that
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
if the secretary of state's office goes
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
to inspect where they're stored and i
 
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
specifically left a secretary of state's
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
exception to the access
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
and finds that they are not stored
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
properly i want to be able to get that
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
over to the attorney general's office to
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
get the attention of the municipality to
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
say hey
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
you need to deal with that and i and i
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
say that because there was a recount
 
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
say that because there was a recount
once

02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
where the boxes were delivered for the
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
recount and they forgot a box because it
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
was pushed under somebody's desk
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is time for our officials to start
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
paragraph three of the amendment
 
02:16:33.519 --> 02:16:35.429 align:start position:0%
paragraph three of the amendment
provides

02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:16:35.439 --> 02:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
provides
um

02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
that there basically is a notice and
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
settlement provision
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
and paragraph four also provides that if
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
there is a need for restitution and
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
there are specific requirements for
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
restitution it's not just a number
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the air
 
02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.070 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the air
um

02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
that there can be a penalty for
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
restitution for example the state spent
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand dollars for the
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
wyndham audit windham has not paid a
 
02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.910 align:start position:0%
wyndham audit windham has not paid a
dime

02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
dime
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
and wyndham officials continue to point
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
the officials at the point of point of
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
finger at the state saying the state did
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:15.509 align:start position:0%
something wrong
so

02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
they've never denied they've continued
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
to they've never retracted their
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
statement that the boxes were not
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
delivered in time for the election after
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office produced
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the receipt showing they were delivered
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so this was my effort to try and put
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
something in statute that will allow the
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general as the person who is
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate enforcement of our election
 
02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:44.309 align:start position:0%
ultimate enforcement of our election
laws

02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:17:44.319 --> 02:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
laws
to

02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
be able to have
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
discussions with municipalities that
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
actually result in a penalty that may
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
cause them
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
to take a little more control and
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
interest of what the procedures are so i
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
apologize for being long-winded but
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
that is why this amendment was done i
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
think it does go to the intent of the
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
original bill which is trying to deal
 
02:18:07.599 --> 02:18:08.469 align:start position:0%
original bill which is trying to deal
with

02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:18:08.479 --> 02:18:09.589 align:start position:0%
with
election

02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
the conduct of elections where things
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
might not be going as they should be
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
um and with that it is open for
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
discussions or i'd be happy to take
 
02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.429 align:start position:0%
discussions or i'd be happy to take
questions

02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative barry i don't know how
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
many uh questions remember chairman this
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
is overly necessary at this point um you
 
02:18:26.479 --> 02:18:27.750 align:start position:0%
is overly necessary at this point um you
have

02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
elected officials conducting elections
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
to call them derelict in their duty
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
would be a compliment
 
02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:37.509 align:start position:0%
would be a compliment
um

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's reached a level of absurdity
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
as the chairman just said that it's
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
almost stranger than fiction that you
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
can have 25 instances where you
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
knowingly did your job wrong and you're
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
like so what
 
02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
like so what
um

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's the other problem and we've
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
spoken this length is these town
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
elections are
 
02:18:56.319 --> 02:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
elections are
notoriously

02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
notoriously
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
low turnout low interest affairs
 
02:19:00.319 --> 02:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
low turnout low interest affairs
and

02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
you get these people they'll run for
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
reelection and no one will contest them
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
because they just don't know so there's
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
no other way at this point to
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
get people to do the job that they
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
signed up to do and i'm not a fan of
 
02:19:17.230 --> 02:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
punishing municipalities or people
 
02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:18.389 align:start position:0%
punishing municipalities or people
[Music]

02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
financially but what other recourse have
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
they left us with at this point it's
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's malfeasance it's
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
it think about the time we have wasted
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
on this committee because wyndham
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't clean their machines or they
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
used an illegal voting machine
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
an unauthorized voting machine
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
folding machine excuse me folding
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
machine um
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's insane like this we have to do
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
this it's it's it's sad it has come to
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
you i i echo those those same sentiments
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
i was
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
um i came here and i asked for this
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee and i ran uh for a state
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative because of the problems
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
we had in derry in 2016.
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
and we got the same monitor moderator
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
elected after that so we have the
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
similar situation we have a new
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
moderator now things are better uh but
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
when i saw what happened in windham and
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
all the work that we've put into this
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
and then i saw the boxes as they arrived
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
at the recount and they were
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
some of them were open
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
the the tape was just all over the place
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
if it was there the the signatures may
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
or may not have been there it was
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
infuriating to say the least and then to
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
find out once again
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the people of windham seem to
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
in a very dysfunctional way i'll just
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
say dysfunctional
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're not paying attention to it
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what to say i have i'm
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
left speechless
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's so frustrating so i applaud
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you i love it i'm
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
voting for it
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative terozian thank you madam
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
chair and one of the things that hasn't
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
been mentioned yet is the damage it's
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
done to voter integrity in this state
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
people have have
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get that back and so
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's another reason why there has to
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
be punitive measures going forward to
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
ensure that we
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
we do the job correctly and it's not
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
being done correctly
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
we solve it so that people feel
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
confident at the end of the day that
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
their vote mattered and it was done
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.190 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
first let me say that i think this
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is tremendously better than
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
the language of the original bill
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i won't be supporting
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the bill if this
 
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:44.389 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the bill if this
amendment

02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:21:44.399 --> 02:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
amendment
passes

02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of the issues i have with it is
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's not clear who can file complaints
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
what the process would be and who they
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
file them with
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
i understand that it's the attorney
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
general who's going to assess the fine
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
but how does the the complaint process
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
how is that conducted
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
also who ultimately determines
 
02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
also who ultimately determines
negligence

02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
negligence
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh are there criteria or standards for
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
that i don't know or is it someone's
 
02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
that i don't know or is it someone's
opinion

02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
do know that a number of the clerics had
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
concerns or issues with the secretary of
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
state's office and the attorney
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
general's office during the last
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
state general election
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
because they felt that they were being
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
confrontational rather than supportive
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
and and the clerks and election
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
officials looked to those offices for
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
guidance and support and interpretations
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
and don't always get it or don't get it
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner so i can conceive of
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
situations where problems occur because
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the clerks never got the support or
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
information they needed
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be a law that
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
provides a process for removal of
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
election procedures election officials
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
and and i say that because
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
if there are actually election officials
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
who don't care if they're not performing
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
their jobs response
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
effectively or responsibly
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're elected officials and they're
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to stay in office and can continue
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
to do that and we're not really solving
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
i also wonder who's going to make the
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
determinations in the field as to
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not on election day someone
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
is performing their
 
02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
tasks responsibly
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
i have to say that
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
i know the attorney general's office
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
sends people out to the polling places
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
many of them are very experienced and
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
but in a lot of instances they don't
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
i can tell you several exam examples
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
from my own experience
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is a checklist for example that
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
the ag's office uses to determine if the
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
polling place is set up right and one of
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
my wards was faulted for not having a
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
flag outside of the polling place
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
the polling place was in a school and
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
there was a flag and a flagpole right at
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
the entrance so i don't know how we
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
could have been faulted for not having a
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
flag outside of the building in another
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
instance we had long lines during a
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
presidential election and the ag's
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative told the moderator to
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
print out a second checklist and set up
 
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
another set of tables so they could be
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
operating the same books
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
in two locations
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
clearly the individual didn't understand
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
what the laws were
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh or even worse we had a situation when
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
the ag's office appointed a state rep to
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
serve as his representative
 
02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
serve as his representative
in

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
her own ward in which she had just lost
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
the race for moderator and she spent the
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
the entire day harassing the moderator
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
who had beater in the previous election
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
and when i called the ag's office to get
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
her out of there nothing happened
 
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:40.790 align:start position:0%
her out of there nothing happened
so

02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
i you know these these are all kinds of
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
frustrations from the other side of the
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
table if you will
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes the clerics and the election
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
officials don't get the help that they
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
need or they feel that they're being
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
picked on by the ag's office
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
will this help bring to light some
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
issues perhaps i don't know
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's going to solve
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
the problem that that we have with
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
election officials who continue to get
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
elected to office and don't care whether
 
02:25:10.270 --> 02:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
or not they fulfill their
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities properly
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately i'll be voting against
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then the bill is
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
amended thank you
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on the
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to read the news
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
number two that paragraph
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it it reads to me like the public
 
02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
and it it reads to me like the public
officer

02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
causes the county city town so the
 
02:25:39.359 --> 02:25:41.910 align:start position:0%
causes the county city town so the
officer

02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
who is negligently failed is supposed to
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
cause the city county and whatever to
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
impose the fee i'm just not quite sure i
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
think i know
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
i i think that you know this i suppose
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
is one of the the worst practices of
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers and legislators you start with
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
what's already on paper so read
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:04.630 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
right

02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
right so we're starting with a paragraph
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
that i suppose one could argue is not
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
entirely clear
 
02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
entirely clear
um

02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then change the legal standard
 
02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
and then change the legal standard
with

02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and then add in regards to the fact
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
that it is a civil penalty given that
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is an exception to the overall
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
level of offense is a is a violation
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't view this as any different than
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
section 1 lines 10 through 12 is
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
currently in statute right and
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of any action formally
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
taken by the secretary of state or
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to what occurs on election
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
day i'm familiar with the checklist i
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
know that the checklist comes back but
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
the communities are given an opportunity
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
to respond and then it goes through a
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
further process to get to the point
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
where the secretary of state is excuse
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
me the attorney general's office who's
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
investigating after the secretary of
 
02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
investigating after the secretary of
state

02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
is actually generating a letter
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
after doing what i think they refer to
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
more as a process audit when questions
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
are raised they go through a process
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
audit with communities and they do it
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
every election with multiple communities
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
we just don't hear about it
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
i view this as being the action after
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that because that's exactly how the
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
statute works now the nobody is in the
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
polling places assessing fines or making
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
findings as to representative bergeron's
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
comment about the support
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think that goes to an underlying issue
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the legislature needs to start
 
02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
that the legislature needs to start
addressing

02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
which is whether the secretary of
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
state's office is funded appropriately
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
and whether we need to be doing
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
something differently in regards to
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
the resources they have to support our
 
02:27:54.399 --> 02:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
the resources they have to support our
elections

02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe that goes with the
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state's office so
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
so in roman numeral two i don't disagree
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
but in roman numeral two
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
is it then the attorney general who
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
makes the decision or
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes because as it is now it is the
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general who is responsible for
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement so would be making the
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
decision so if i'm reading this right
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
the public officer by their actions
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
basically will subject the if if the ag
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
thinks it's negligence we'll subject the
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
county and city the community that right
 
02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
county and city the community that right
um

02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
not the individual right or that
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
where the conduct occurred to be subject
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
to a civil penalty okay so not required
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%

02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
chance to speak to you for a little bit
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
why don't you come on down and sit at
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
this chair jack
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
is from oklahoma
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
right there perfect and he came down
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
with his grandfather this morning
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead you might
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate this he was apparently
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
subjected to a 45 minute discussion in
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
the car on the way down here
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
on how the legislature works
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe you might want to talk to him
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards to see what he really thought
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
of that whole process um and so i
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
thought it would be terrific that since
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
he was so attentive during this that if
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
he had any questions he wanted to ask
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
any of us that he would be able to so
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
with the committee's indulgence we're
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
going to take a few minutes and see if
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
there are any questions welcome to the
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
election law committee thank you very
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
much for coming nice um yeah so i had a
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
couple questions all right um
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of them was
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
as i was
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
um watching you
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
i realized that there are 20 people who
 
02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
vote right yes
 
02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:44.389 align:start position:0%
vote right yes
so

02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
what happens if it's 10 to 10.
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
so do you know what happens if
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
so what happens when it's like you heard
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
one one vote was 15 to five so do so you
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
heard your grandfather this morning what
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
happens when a vote when there's a
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
winner what happens then
 
02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.030 align:start position:0%
winner what happens then
um

02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:09.990 align:start position:0%
um
then

02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
if it's a yes then it goes to the senate
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
if it's a no wait both they go to the
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
senate if it's
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
right so if there's a winner then then
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
everybody outside of this room gets to
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
vote on it and it goes to the senate
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
right because because we are so smart
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
when we recommend something everybody
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
goes along with it right
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
all right so your question is what
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
happens when there's 10 10 because that
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
means we can't agree right yeah
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right so who wants to explain a
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
floor debate
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron you want to give
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
it a shot sure since we're going to be
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with that pretty soon
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
and believe me this was an education for
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
me too because it's very rare that you
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
sent something out of committee with a
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
thai vote
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
we had a bill with the thai vote it came
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 which means that we can't
 
02:38:58.160 --> 02:38:59.270 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 which means that we can't
decide

02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
decide
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we send the bill over to the full
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
house of representatives and let them
 
02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
house of representatives and let them
decide

02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
decide
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
and what we will do is submit
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
let's call them reports uh one group of
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
ten people will give their argument and
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
the other group of ten people print
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
their argument and then we let the house
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
have at it and the the full membership
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
will debate it on the floor and they'll
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
take a vote and hopefully break the tie
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what other questions did you so
 
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
another one is what other kinds of
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
things do you discuss it sounded like
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
this was mostly about voting is that
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
just like in a particular season or
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that is sort of our life
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
oh really
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we talk about here elections
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
and voting if you're here on a day when
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
there are other meetings going on you
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
might find a room where all they talk
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
about is transportation and pavement and
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
cars and you might find another room
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
where what they talk about is
 
02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:03.270 align:start position:0%
where what they talk about is
fishing

02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
what what's another somebody else say
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
another subject matter that another
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.230 --> 02:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
schools right we have a committee that
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
talks about education in schools and
 
02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:24.070 align:start position:0%
talks about education in schools and
energy

02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.269 align:start position:0%
energy
and

02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
to end laws
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
right and money money money the
 
02:40:30.479 --> 02:40:31.590 align:start position:0%
right and money money money the
committee

02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
you have your grandfather show you the
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
room where they talk about money because
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
you won't be surprised to learn they get
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
a bigger better room
 
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
because they're talking about money all
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah you have any other questions
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative friedas what did you want
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
having been a school teacher
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
i like to explain things and this one i
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
explained to a lot of people that there
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
are 400 representatives
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the chamber
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and there are 20 committees so if you do
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the math there are 20 committees with 20
 
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
people on each committee
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then they get together in the
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
representatives chamber to where they
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
vote but 100 people and
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sure your grandfather will take you
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
over to see the chamber after this all
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
right so what other questions did you
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
does the senate if like they kind of are
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
tied up do they ever come back or like
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
if it was unclear do they ever come back
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
and ask your opinion or advice
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think this might be our open this is
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
our opening to talk about the senate
 
02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
our opening to talk about the senate
everybody

02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
i think this is it
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
i think clerk smith be darn
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
um well your grandfather could probably
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
talk about that because he used to be a
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
senator but you know we have this really
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
sort of funny rule
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
where we're not supposed to talk about
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like voldemort
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
voldemort you don't speak their name
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about the senate because
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're like
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
there's only 24 of them
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
and and they just really think a lot
 
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
different we haven't really figured it
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
out but there is something at the end of
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
the term when we pass something like we
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
talked about and they have a bill that
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
they talked about where if we disagree
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have something what do we call that
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative growing the committee of
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that's when we get to meet with the
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
senate and do you know what they call
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's like a month it's like two weeks
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
when that happens do you know what the
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
people who work here call those two
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
weeks what
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
crazy time
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the crazy season they say when
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
committees of conference happen and the
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
how often
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
and in what quantity do people get
 
02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:00.770 align:start position:0%
and in what quantity do people get
replaced

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
you mean like on the committee
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
or in the election
 
02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.150 align:start position:0%
or in the election
um

02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
like people here like
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
like is it like er
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
every time there's new people it's like
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
a whole new group or is it like this
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
person gets replaced and that person
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
gets replaced
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have 20 people who are specifically
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
assigned to this committee whether they
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
wanted it or not
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
they have to come but sometimes they
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
can't come representative chase maybe
 
02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
you can explain to us because
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
i know from another committee judiciary
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
but she's actually
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
new to election law today so maybe she
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
can explain how she ended up having to
 
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
come into election law today i can do
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that yes as as representative
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
griffin said i or chair griffin i should
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
say no um i do come from another
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee so when somebody on a
 
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee cannot attend and they're
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
absent we do have substitutes so what
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
you do is you let your
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
leaders know that you're willing to sub
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
which i did
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
and then they'll say okay you can suffer
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
this person who's going to be missing
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that's okay that i
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
can just come in and sit down it has to
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
be approved by the speaker of the house
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
to say yes i approve that you can sit in
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
for so and so and that's what i do so
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here today
 
02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
i'm here today
to

02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
do my duty
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
to help to vote because it's very very
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
important on our executive committee
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
days when we're voting on things to pass
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
them to the next level
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
the full house or the full 20 people
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
here so that's what i'm doing i'm a sub
 
02:44:51.439 --> 02:44:53.670 align:start position:0%
here so that's what i'm doing i'm a sub

02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
so and another thing is
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
when people come in when they're new
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%

02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
do they know how to do this or do you
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%

you're here today for election law did
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
you have any idea really what we were
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
02:45:50.319 --> 02:45:51.190 align:start position:0%
talking about today
okay

02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
so she came
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
and she really didn't understand a lot
 
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the details
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
but she knew how to vote because she
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
knows that there are some people that
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
she really trusts with their opinion of
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
how things work so she voted with them
 
02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
sort of like all the time
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
not she actually yes that's true we had
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
some errand subs here today
 
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
there are rules of subbing just like
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
when there's a substitute teacher
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to follow the lesson
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
plan that the person worked out for the
 
02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:23.670 align:start position:0%
plan that the person worked out for the
day

02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to stick to it and
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
every once in a while they go off track
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
but we try to keep them on track and
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
then the rest of us who come here all
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
we might talk about what's coming up to
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
see if we're all going to agree or
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
disagree because we try to be very
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
agreeable when we're in public sort of
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
like a family right
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
you try to be
 
02:46:46.710 --> 02:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
you do the best you can to try to work
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
things out so we might have some idea
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
how everybody's going to vote but to be
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
honest and today was one of those days
 
02:46:55.110 --> 02:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
you never really know till the vote's
 
02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:58.070 align:start position:0%
you never really know till the vote's
taken

02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.080 --> 02:46:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:46:59.190 --> 02:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
and another one is
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
um madame chair cause they won't see one
 
02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:10.730 align:start position:0%
because they won't call me queen
 
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
because they won't call me queen
[Laughter]

02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
they call me chair because somebody has
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
to to be in charge of how things go
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
right it just makes things easier if
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
somebody sort of
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
and they call me madam because this is
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
part of parliamentary procedure and you
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
address people respectfully by title so
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
for example we have a clerk and you
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
would already refer to them as clerk and
 
02:47:47.439 --> 02:47:48.469 align:start position:0%
would already refer to them as clerk and
because

02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
it used to be chairman
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
so now we tend to just say chair they
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
say madam chair
 
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
and you did away with the genuflecting
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's it's been a big
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
transition but i i've been trying
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative ward did you want to add
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
something i would just point out that in
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
good good 17th century fashion she has a
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
bigger chair
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i was asking i was
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
i was actually going to maybe say it
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
because you have a big chair because you
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
get a fancy headrest exactly
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
the title comes from the object
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
the curator that's important
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah there are some people here in this
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
room who know a lot about the history
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
and how things worked
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
so then another thing which um
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
my grandfather wanted to say
 
02:48:37.359 --> 02:48:38.230 align:start position:0%
my grandfather wanted to say
is

02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
which means i'm not very important
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think you
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
you are certainly the
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
must be the smartest ones of all those
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
23 grandchildren
 
02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
so madame
 
02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
chair could have a follow-up question
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
please sure
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
mr gruen
 
02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:14.070 align:start position:0%
mr gruen
after

02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
watching and observing today
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
might you have any interest in running
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
for a political office someday
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
but it does seem pretty neat and it
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
it was actually much different than i
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
thought it would be i kind of thought it
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
would be like
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
like everyone like signs on papers and
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
like one thing takes like a whole day
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
but you would go through one thing in
 
02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:45.190 align:start position:0%
but you would go through one thing in
like

02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
five minutes yeah
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was just a little
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
interesting because i think it they
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
would take longer and you'd also sign
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
off and make sure everything was right
 
02:49:56.550 --> 02:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of work that needs to
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
be done now so there will be people
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
running around with papers to sign off
 
02:50:03.510 --> 02:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
so it can all go in the report for the
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
400 people to vote on but you're right
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
we we as a group try to get through
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
things as as well as we can and as
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
