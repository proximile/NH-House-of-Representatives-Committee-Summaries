00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
time being 1010 I'm going to open the
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
660 and uh recognize representative om
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
to introduce the Bill thank you Mr
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm here to introduce House
 
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm here to introduce House
Bill

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
660 with an amendment requiring histor
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
racing facilities to compensate their
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
host communities with 10% of the HHR
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
winnings so the current situation we
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
have is that we've had the uh expansion
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
of historic horse racing into fairly
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
large properties without having a opin
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
referendum which was normally part of
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
private part of previous Casino
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
bills and in fact when we've done
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
expanded gaming we've had um an opt-in
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
provision for Kino and for sports
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
betting so uh we don't have the opt-in
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
situation for the HHR build consequently
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
we don't have any mitigation for local
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh factors involved with large
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
casinos so as I pointed out in previous
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
testimony which I had passed out and
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
would introduce again into the record uh
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
we have some evidence from a study
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
called uh Casino crime and Community
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
costs that indicate the uh projected
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
cost for a city that's going to host the
 
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.829 align:start position:0%
cost for a city that's going to host the
large

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
casino and I
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
will introduce this into the record I
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through the bill again
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
be the copy because you've already heard
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
commentary but the uh goal of the bill
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
is to provide this mitigation to the
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
cities and towns I'm asking for 10%
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation uh I have an amendment in the
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill which is in front of you with the
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
changes highlighted in
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
yellow and the amendment makes the
 
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.030 align:start position:0%
yellow and the amendment makes the
Charities

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
Charities
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
whole from the bill itself the original
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted would take a little ding
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
to the Charities little dink to the
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
state this leaves the Charities hole
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
leaves the state hole and only takes the
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
10 % to be mitigated to the local
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
communities solely out of the operator's
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill questions yes do we have questions
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
represent shamberg thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
representative uh the the 10% mitigation
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
fee why 10% versus maybe not five or six
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
was this to make it easy easy for
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
someone to figure out percent called
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
negotiation I'll ask for 10 I'll sell it
 
00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:08.670 align:start position:0%
negotiation I'll ask for 10 I'll sell it
from

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
five save some
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
time other
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Spar thank
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
you chair you said that the purpose was
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
to raise more revenue for the
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
municipalities um is there an issue
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
right now or with these municipalities
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
and not having enough Revenue coming
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
from the tax assessment and other other
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
areas yeah that's a Perpetual issue but
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
this uh doesn't deal with that
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
longstanding problem of Municipal
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
spending and how to allocate funds what
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
it does do is try to address a specific
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
incremental cost and that goes back to
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
the uh document that I've passed out
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
previously to try to Define what is that
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
incremental cost and can we get some
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation just for that
 
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
cost it won't do anything else to the
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
city budget but'll cover the uh expenses
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
that the city's like likely to incur
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
should they have this kind of a
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
you representative ducet thank you Mr
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
question do you do you have uh reason
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
did the city come to you and say they've
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
incurred fees charges uh upticks because
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about this and and
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've heard is negligible
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
so and and this would be in effect a
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive tax yeah it's um it's not a
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
tend to be retroactive it's tend to be
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
proactive going to the Future uh the
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
cities of town have not come to
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
me uh they haven't experienced any
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
mitigation issues at the present time
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
and in fact the uh mitigation issues are
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
likely to be down the road particularly
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
in the threee in in the time period
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
after about 3 years is when you start to
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
see these costs come into effect per the
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
study so no there's no cost right now
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a instant mitigation
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
right now but I think down the road it
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to uh set the
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
mitigation

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
followup thank you and thank you for
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
taking my followup um like I said we
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard uh testimony about
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
potential impacts those haven't come to
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
fruition and maybe a retroactive word
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
isn't the one I'm using we sat passed
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislation this this was a component of
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
that testimony we heard at the time we
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
passed the legislation and this is a
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
component that the legislature chose not
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
to include so
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm in a town that has a gaming
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
facility my police chief and and Fire
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
Chief and subsequent other Public
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
Service uh Chiefs haven't directed me
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
that they're having issues with this so
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clear up my
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
statement if you you're seeing something
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
different in Nashua uh Manchester and
 
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
others would we're not getting an outcry
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
from from the municipalities that host
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
these uh charitable Gaming facilities so
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
uh and like I said we've we've heard the
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and decided against this type
 
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.909 align:start position:0%
testimony and decided against this type
of

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
tax yeah I appreciate your comments and
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
I agree with you they haven't seen any
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh cost issues or concerns right now I
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
bring this up primarily from past Casino
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
bills that have been uh run through Ways
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
and Means over the past 14 years and
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
typically on a comprehensive Casino bill
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of additional language
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond just a simple authorization of a
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
device which we had in the HHR
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
authorizations we didn't have language
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
for many other factors the other factor
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about which had been in
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
Prior Casino bills which did not pass
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
but had been in the proposals in
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Casino bills were for
 
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.149 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Casino bills were for
local

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
mitigation um there's a bill that
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent Ames had which uh I took some
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
language from there's been other bills
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
that set aside uh funds for various
 
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.390 align:start position:0%
that set aside uh funds for various
concerns

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
and uh because we didn't have a
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Casino bill with the
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
HHR uh enabling
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
legislation I feel that we should think
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
about some of these additional factors
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
that were determined to be important for
 
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
that were determined to be important for
full-fledged

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
casinos follow I would respectfully
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
disagree it was a quite comprehensive
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill I was on the bill and we heard you
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
know extensive testimony in relation to
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
that so I think it's something we
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
visited um I think this might again be
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
an issue that the upcoming commission
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
but all right that's a that's a would
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
question represent Aly yeah I just
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
wanted a clarification does this apply
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
only to new
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
casinos this this bill would apply to uh
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's in place at the time of
 
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.230 align:start position:0%
anything that's in place at the time of
the

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
bill or anything that comes after yeah
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
you any other anyone else seeing none
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Alicia Preston I
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire charitable
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
gaming operators Association and we are
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to this bill as we've
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
testified before on other ones we know
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
of no other industry that is
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
specifically uh kind of targeted to say
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
you have to pay to the municipality
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
differently than any other business if
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the requirement of Municipal
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
services from any industry uh The chle
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
Gaming facilities are asking no more of
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
any town or city
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
than a bar a sport venue a concert venue
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
or any other entertainment that is out
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
there so this is very specific to one
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
industry and uh for that reason we do
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you represent elme yes
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um that may be true in New Hampshire it
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
is not true anywhere else uh but on you
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
were talking about sports venues and
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
things like that we don't have them in a
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
number of the places where they have put
 
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
number of the places where they have put
these

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
casinos uh
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
and and they provided uh they
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
stonewalled our zoning committee on when
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
or rather I think it was the planning
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee when it came to traffic
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
studies on the major East West Route um
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
represent elme can you pull the
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
microphone closer to you
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
sorry on the major East West Route
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire to
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont on we have not
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of extra traffic yet except
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
when it was opening I'm not sure how
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
many people are actually going to it but
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
um as our representative M said
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have historical data now on what
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
happens when casinos move into different
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of cities
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
and um and in every other part of the
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
country they are col they are
 
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.029 align:start position:0%
country they are col they are
collecting

00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
this but we decide in Live Free or Die
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
state that we're not going to do that
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
what is your what is your question my
 
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
what is your what is your question my
question

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
is uh when you talk about we don't do
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
this you mean New Hampshire don't you I
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
yes represent elberger thank you thank
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for taking
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
my question you mentioned other kinds of
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
Enterprises that are not being asked to
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh pay more and you specifically
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned if I remember correctly uh
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
bars uh restaurants and sporting and
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
concert venues and entertainment venue
 
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.990 align:start position:0%
concert venues and entertainment venue
yes

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
have any sense of what the
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
relative um
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh the benefit to the owners of
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
those establishments are compared to
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
gaming I I have no
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
idea not specifically no what I know is
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
that as these facilities grow they pay
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
more property taxes than they did the
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
day before just like any business that
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
grows I also know anecdotally I live at
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach we have two of these
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
facilities and I can assure you from my
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
own experience and witness that
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
Municipal services are far more required
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
at some of the uh other entertainment
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
industries that we have there and they
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
are not specifically required to pay
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
more to the municipality and again the
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
bigger the facility whether it's a bar
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant entertainment venue or gaming
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
facility the more property taxes they
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
pay which more than compensates for any
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Services they would receive
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
and again as with all these businesses
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
they don't put children in the school
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
system which is the largest cost factor
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
for any municipality in the
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
state thank you for your answer I I
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate the comment about
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
elberger followup uh representative you
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
said question so if a business is
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
profitable in one year they make more
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
money than they did last year do they
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
pay more business tax
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay secondarily to that um is
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
there any other business that you know
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
of in the state of New Hampshire that
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
has very strict security requirements to
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
negate what may be an impact on the
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
community and I'm talking about security
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
presence physical Personnel cameras on
 
00:25:52.399 --> 00:25:53.549 align:start position:0%
presence physical Personnel cameras on
every

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
location um subsequent

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
for some reason it's not uh try to pull
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
this strange chair a little bit closer
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to explain a little
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
bit about the history of of this bill
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
this disposal oil discharge and Disposal
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
cleanup fund has been in place at
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
least since 200000 I think probably long
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
long before that uh and it was
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
created on we were told in 2008 when we
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with this um because it kept on
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
being uh its life span kept on being
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
extended and the people behind me would
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
know better
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
on why it needs to be extended again but
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
the the fund was
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
created I believe at the request of the
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
oil companies because in this is what we
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
were told in 2008 um because the uh
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
insurance companies refuse to cover oil
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
spills uh because they can be incredibly
 
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.230 align:start position:0%
spills uh because they can be incredibly
expensive

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes and they have no way of
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
telling when they might happen this
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
particular part of of that is um about
 
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
particular part of of that is um about
leaky

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
leaky
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
tanks uh and particularly people who
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
have tanks that are leaking inside their
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
basements or inside their property that
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
um do not have enough money to remediate
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
it and therefore if it keeps on leaking
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's going out to the street it's going
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
out to all the neighbors and it is a
 
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
out to all the neighbors and it is a
hazard

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
hazard
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
um they may totally refute this when you
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
listen to them but this is what we were
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
told back in
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
2008 uh and it is an insurance policy by
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
the state paid for by the oil companies
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
at their
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
request and um we keep on thinking that
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
they will run out of leaky tanks but
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
apparently they are not and I think you
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
should just listen to Dees okay thank
 
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
should just listen to Dees okay thank
you

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
represent and if you'd fill out a pink
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
card as well I'd appreciate it okay I've
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I appear in support of
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
658 FN I am here representing the energy
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
marketers Association of New Hampshire
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
which is an association of home heating
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
oil companies throughout our state of
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh this fund is actually collected as an
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
import fee um on the fuel that comes
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
state is how this revenue is generated
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 18 through 21 on
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the bill you'll see different areas of
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
products of
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
fuel depending on the amount of product
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
that comes in is where they generate the
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
funds from and these numbers in this
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation has been massaged a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
little bit some of it goes up some of it
 
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.589 align:start position:0%
little bit some of it goes up some of it
goes

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
down in relationship sh to underground
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
storage tanks that fail um this fund was
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
set up to try to provide um Revenue to
 
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.190 align:start position:0%
set up to try to provide um Revenue to
help

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate um environmental hazards to
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
help replace tanks for those individuals
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
that could not afford to do so um and
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
some people's Insurance do cover it but
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
we work with Department of Environmental
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
Services to try to ensure that um we
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
limit and we provide financial
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to those who need it to
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
replace tanks um and industry does
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
support this build but just to be clear
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
um all these little add-ons or that you
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
see this bill eventually do make their
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
way down to the consumer I mean it's
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's not eaten by the oil company so um
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to try to answer any
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions I know Dees is behind me and
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
they can probably go into a very
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
distinct detail for you right represent
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question as I'm
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the rates you mentioned that
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're going up and down some are going
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
up and some are
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
down as far as I'm able to
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
interpret and that that's not this my
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
forte here it looks like
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
the part that is going up is or one of
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
the parts that's going up is for the on
 
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.390 align:start position:0%
the parts that's going up is for the on
premise

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
premise
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
heating that's the second number second
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
set of numbers that that's
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
listed uh let's
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
see on line 20 online 19 line 19 yes
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
that that number is going up and that is
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
um uh it's home he yes correct how was
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the why why these particular number why
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
are these particular numbers changing in
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
the direction they are I'm just trying
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
to understand the so there is it's
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
called an odd fund committee a group
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
that meets they're the ones that put
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
this together I am not on that committee
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar um the prime
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill at CZ and night
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee along with Senator Howard
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
Pearl um in my discussion with both of
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
them was that this is what that
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee hashed out probably also um I
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
think they sat down with um uh someone
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
had helped do an audit of their work to
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
make recommendations and my brief
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
discussions with them on these numbers
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
and the trending of where these numbers
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
are going um to try to make sure that
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
this fund stays solvent that's the
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
extent of my knowledge okay thank you
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yes uh represent opal thank you Mr
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
question and perhaps if you can answer
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
it the representative from Dees can but
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm a little confused and I'm not
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
a lawyer so um it's probably not
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
surprising but on line 15
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
it says any person who Imports or causes
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
to be imported oil into the state except
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
those using oil pipelines railroads and
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
highways to transport oil products
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
between states other than New Hampshire
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
or for international
 
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.870 align:start position:0%
or for international
transport

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
transport
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
so am I understanding that the only
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
people who have to get licenses are
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
not not not importing oil from other
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
states or internationally or they I'm
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to defer to them representative
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's okay thanks Mr chair if I could
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
deferm my question till the next witness

Services the oil fund dispersement board
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
from which this uh Bill originated is
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
administratively attached by Statute to
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
we carry out the administrative
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
processes of what the oil fund
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
dispersement board requests that we
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
do this bill impacts two different funds
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
it impacts the oil discharge and
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
Disposal cleaning fund as well as the
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
oil Pollution Control fund and it it
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
makes four changes to the existing
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
statutes those changes are one to change
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
the date due date of an annual report
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
the other to raise the cap on
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for lowincome homeowners
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
for tank replacement when they have a
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
home heating oil tank that is suspect
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
and may
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
leak it
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
also extends the collection of these
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
fees for 10 years the the previous bill
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
has an intentional Sunset of 10 years as
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
does this proposed Bill and then it
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
adjusts the fees on the various types of
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
petroleum and all Petroleum in general
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's imported into the state u in the
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
statutory purpose of both funds it's to
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
cope with the problem of oil spills
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
petroleum us used so much throughout
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
society and the general court saw that
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
there was a problem with petroleum
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
products and the impact that they could
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
have on human health and the environment
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater resources Drinking Water
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
Resources the I call it the odd fund so
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's the the one administered by the
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
oil fund dispersement board oil
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
discharge disposal fund it reimburses
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
responsible parties for cost to
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
remediate oil spills at compliant tank
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
storage facilities so that is the actual
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
cost of corrective action and what this
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
is is excess insurance so if there's any
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
insurance available that will cover that
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
cost of remediation if that insurance
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or is expended then the
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
odd fund comes in and pays for those
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
corrective action costs at these oil
 
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.150 align:start position:0%
corrective action costs at these oil
spill

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
spill
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
sites also the odd fund helps to uh
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
prevent oil spill releases part of our
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
prevention program including that four
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned safe tank program which is the
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
replacement of home heating oil tanks
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
for low-income home owners and it
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
satisfies both Federal and State
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility requirements
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
for owners of underground storage tank
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
facilities as was mentioned
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
previously that it was one point and I'm
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
not sure about the difficulty currently
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
to obtain insurance for underground
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
storage tank system
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
but there was this requirement put on
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
federally to have money Financial
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
Assurance to be able to pay for release
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
from your us and this fund also
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
satisfies that requirement the oil
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control fund the other fund
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's affected by this bill is for the
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
agencies emergency response spill
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
response and prevention efforts so that
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
includes that's financial support for a
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
24-hour day 7 day per week 365 day per
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
year spill response program primarily
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
responding to petroleum releases but
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
about 90% of the releases we respond to
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
are petroleum and there are about 300
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
responses that are performed per year to
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
releases for this committee I I believe
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
the important part to know is about
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
those fee changes and and those
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
expenses and the oil fund dispersement
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
board hired Taylor and Moulder an
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm to
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
review the expend the anticipated
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures of the odd
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
fund and that was using information
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
going back 10 years information compiled
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
by the department on current sites
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
information about future use and
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
exposure depending on types of tanks and
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
tank systems that are in
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
place and
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
then compared that to oil import volumes
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
as long along with us Energy Information
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
Administration data on fuel usage in New
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh both for gas and Diesel so
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
motor fuel as well as home heating oil
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
fuel and with that they tried to
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
balance the which category of fee pays
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
for which type of spill SO gas and
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
Diesel paying for releases from tanks
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
that have gas and diesel fuel home
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
heating oil playing for releases or fuel
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
oil paying for releases from on premise
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
use facilities which are typically home
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
heating oil tanks motor oil
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
paying for releases from motor oil tanks
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
and then there there there's one other
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
fee and it's it it's called all other
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
oil in the in the bill or in in the
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
statute but it's actually on all oil and
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
that portion there is for the oil
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control fund that is the spill
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
response side of of
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
operations that explains some of the
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
strange numbers going out to far decimal
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
points and that this was based on an
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
Actuarial review and was attempting to
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
balance those costs across the different
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
types of oil that's imported into the
 
00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:42.430 align:start position:0%
types of oil that's imported into the
state

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
and with that they were looking at the
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
after this 10year time period
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
when this bill this statute will sunset
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
again that we were left with enough to
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
pay that fiscal Year's administrative
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
costs as well as a quarter of the
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated reimbursements for a fiscal
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
year so those are the corrective action
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and currently we we
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a balance of $1.5 million in
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
order to have the first three days of a
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
major Coastal oil oil spill covered in
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
that oil Pollution Control fund because
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
we could see the state having to pay
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
those first expenses
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
until the federal oil spill liability
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund comes in and starts paying
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
for those major spills we have quite a
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
bit of oil stored along the pascar river
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
and that is is the reason for having
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
that balance in order to be able to
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
spill I know there were there were some
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions asked before of the the other
 
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.430 align:start position:0%
questions asked before of the the other
uh

00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
commenters and may need reminder on
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
those questions okay thank you um I just
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
want to ask the actual Actuarial review
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
is that is are these recommended new
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
changes from that review
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
process the the Actuarial review came
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
out with the with them exactly balanced
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
the oil fund dispersement board looked
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
at that and they found that the fuel oil
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
fee was going to have to go up over 200%
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for those releases from on
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
premise use facilities home heating oil
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
that is our largest category of new
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
releases that occur there are about a
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
hundred a year in that category for all
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
of our other tank systems that are
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
eligible the number of spills that occur
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
from those systems is is typically less
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
than 10 total per year
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
and those systems have regulations that
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
are enforced by the Department of
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services SO gas stations
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
they have regulations they have to
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
adhere to regulations applying to home
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
heating oil systems are strictly within
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
the National Fire Protection Association
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
standards and those uh have minimal
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement or requirements uh with
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
those and so the this the board decided
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be too much to
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
balance that particularly on the fuel
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
oil side so they proposed that the fuel
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
oil fee goes up 100% instead of that 200
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
I think in 18% so more than uh doubling
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
and rebalance the other fees based on
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
that so that did that continued to
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
result in the gas and Diesel fee
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
dropping it was going to drop a little
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
bit more if those particular spills were
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
balanced across the fees pipes so that
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
that is the difference from what the
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
actual review found okay thank you uh
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
op thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I had the unfortunate experience
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
in 2010 of spending a significant
 
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
portion of my summer helping the
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of the Navy um develop a
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
recovery plan for the Gul Coast in the
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
wake of the deep waterer Horizon um
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
spill and I became way too familiar with
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
the oils build liability trust fund um
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
which as I am trying to remember 15
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
years ago as I understood the fund it
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
was created to deal with spills for
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
which there was no identifiable
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
responsible party is that your
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
understanding well so there can be
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
identifiable responsible parties but
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
they are potential responsible parties
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
until the legal process works through
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
and so there right so there'd be
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement excuse me that trust fund
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
will come in and it will pay reimburse
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
State costs Mr chair I follow up follow
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
up so what um what I was trying to get
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
to in my other question was I as I read
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh lines 13
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
through 15 or 16 I guess I'm not clear
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
who is covered here it it it sounds
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
like well I'm just not clear who's who's
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
covered it it sounds like anybody who
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
brings it in by rail um pipe or Highway
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
which other than Port that's the only
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
one that's left out so I mean are we
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do just cover the ports or so
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
U what this covers is oil that use its
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
destination of use is is in New
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oil that just passes through
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
the state as part of Commerce doesn't
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
get an oil import fee so if it goes
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
into goes into a gas station in the
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
state goes into a home heating oil tank
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to get used in New Hampshire
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
then that applies I believe this is an
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce issue and why that
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
is carved out yeah one more followup Mr
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
chair okay and I I'll just remind
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
members too that the policy committee
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
we're a second committee the policy
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
committee has has given their okay on I
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
forget what the vote was 18 to nothing
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever we're focused on do these
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
numbers make sense go ahead and
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
represent opal what I what I was going
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
to ask Mr chair is if it's possible to
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
obtain the numbers that that back up the
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
data here in other words you know over
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years your actuarials used
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
information regarding how many spills
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
how many claims names how much was you
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
know appropriated um or spent um and how
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
you came to that and I just would make
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
that request yes we can we can provide
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial report it it is U I
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
believe a 60 plus page report I have the
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the 26 page executive summary of it here
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
with me but happy to provide that and
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
that is using a a number of different
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
data sources and Actuarial techniques to
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
come up with the projection
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
I I'd be fine with the executive summary
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative ORS
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
my question so real quick as just you
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
said there's about a 100 private spills
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
a year that are identified isn't are we
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
identifying these through a dying system
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever and isn't there is there a
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
preventative plan to clean this mess up
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
so we're not dealing with it after the
 
00:56:54.799 --> 00:56:58.109 align:start position:0%
so we're not dealing with it after the
fact

00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
so there there are a few
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
different cave caveat or places within
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to that um the home heating
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
oil releases of which typically a 100 a
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
year and probably about 60 to 70 of
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
those are paid for through this fund
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
those get called in typically by the
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner or the fire department and
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
they call in Dees and our spill response
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
team goes to that home home and assist
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
the homeowner with the things that they
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
need to do to have that spill properly
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
remediated and to ensure that it doesn't
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
have a long-term impact on their
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
groundwater or their indoor air quality
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
within the house uh that fuel is dyed
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
but that dye is is for other tax
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
purposes that are federal so it's dyed
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
red the home heating oil it's very it's
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
essentially diesel fuel it's the same
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
type of fuel then we have the universe
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
of tanks that are regulated such as the
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
gas station underground storage tanks
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
and there are significant Federal and
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
both state regulations the state
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
regulations are authorized through the
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
federal process to take their place and
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
we get very few spills so less than 10 a
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
year total from all of those and
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
typically those spills no longer are
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
coming from the tank they usually coming
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
from the piping or a sump or something
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the tank or an overfill
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
when the delivery truck comes and and
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
drops the uh the fuel into that
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
underground storage tank so they the the
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
category of home heating oil there are
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
just not regulations that apply there to
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
prevent those
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
spills okay follow up so are most of the
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
home heating oil in iences are they the
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
result of sloppiness or degenerating
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
tanks or pipes or yes the majority of
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
the spills are from the tanks U rusting
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
rusting from the inside out and then
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
having a pinhole leak or something
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's larger it's in a basement or it's
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
outside and doesn't get noticed right
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
away until all 275 gallons have been
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
released out of the tank representative
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
Brier uh yeah just uh on line 13 I think
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's beginning uh section three and then
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
on line 28 section four on the oil
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control fund you have a
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
effective date of July 1st of um
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
2025 and and I understand why that is
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
but my question is um when uh you talk
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
to safety about the collection process I
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
believe there's like
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
234 uh uh oil discharge and pollution
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
accounts are about 135 Distributors
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
approximately and my question is usually
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
they have a little lead time where they
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
got to notify the Distributors about a
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
change in the tax rate they also have to
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
call the vendor to make sure that they
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
have time to update the system and the
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
third thing is uh sometimes the
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
distributors in the oil pollution
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
controls need a little lead time to uh
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
update their ACC tax software systems so
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
my only concern is on those two
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
sections did safety give you any
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
indication of the lead time they needed
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
to I'm I'm just saying this July 1 thing
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
might be a little tight by the time this
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
pass and gets if this passes and gets
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor how much lead
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
time does the department of safety have
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
to implement these
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
changes we we haven't had that
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department of Safety
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
as of yet we do have a member of the
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety on the oil fund
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
dispersement board Jennifer Hall and I
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
think that's a a good thing for us to
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
bring up with her Jennifer actually
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and asked the question
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
when um everything was going to be
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
finalized so we're we're in discussion
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
right we're in discussion right now
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Hall and I are in discussion to
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
um for her so she's talking to me about
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
the lead time we haven't talked about an
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
exact date but I have had discussion
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
with her Mr chairman followup followup
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
so I I the only I understand this whole
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with this subject and
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
my only concern concern is that and uh
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that you might need an
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to compensate for that lead
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
time to give the Departments enough time
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
to implement this properly so they can
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
notify their their uh pay taxpayers or
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
licenses and I'm just thinking there
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
should be some sort of amendment to
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
account for that uh administrative
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
time represent
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
YY yeah if this were to pass with the
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
timeline we have now all that means is
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
it not correct that all that means is
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
that then the board would be a to
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
implement immediately any changes that
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
they pass through the re uh regular
 
01:02:09.799 --> 01:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
they pass through the re uh regular
administrative

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
process I think I need that clarified
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to address the uh issue
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
of uh time and lead and everything else
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
once the law is in
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
effect then the board can put it into
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
effect when they set their own rules and
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
change rates is that correct I I believe
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it will go into
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
2025 follow up yeah followup andway once
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
effect then the boards would set the
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
dates and times and everything else for
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
the implementation of what was in effect
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's not an instantaneous we're going to
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
do it at this date because you still
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
have your administrative process
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
correct I I don't know the answer to
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
that hold in
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
office I think what what he's trying to
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to get to is um if the
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
date is still set at July 1 does the um
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
in the billing process uh behind the
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
scenes could this be taken care of in
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
other words it's like okay you can
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
notify people that the price went up but
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
you may still be billing them at the old
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
price but at the next bill it be caught
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
up so instead of us doing an amendment
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
can this be handled internally I believe
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
that would be reasonable and that would
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
be available to the
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
board we be the board's decision on how
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
they okay representative
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
yri yeah to get back on topic of what
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with this particular Bill
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
raises and lower some effects some
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
different charges in different areas
 
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
this is a realignment of the actual cost
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
to do uh the work that the uh odd people
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
do right yes so it's essentially
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
housekeeping and in construction that is
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's a making an adjustment up and down
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
to cover the needs of the odd board to
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
do the work that is being done yes that
 
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.190 align:start position:0%
do the work that is being done yes that
is

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
correct is this a followup
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
is this a general increase to the
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
consumer or decrease or where where are
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
we in that scale yes this results in an
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
8% overall
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
increase of total import fee
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue all yes when you say import fee
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue we're now talking about any oil
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
product that is brought into the state
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
either by truck or by ship or train I
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
suppose some train
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
cars I doubt that
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
um that is sold at the at the
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
pump so the feet per gallon of a
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
gasoline is not necessarily reflected
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
because this would apply a cost gasoline
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
petroleum um oil household hold oil oil
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's sold in cans uh at
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the oiles or wherever oil you get put in
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
if you you're too damn lazy to change it
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
yourself or don't want to get cold
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
laying on your
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
back is that correct that is correct so
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
that 8% is on the wholesale cost not the
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
retail cost is that
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
correct I don't think I'm in the best
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
position to answer that question as I'm
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
not a retailer and I I don't sell these
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
products and I would
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
they how they manage these
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
costs thank you represent
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
elmy yeah I was just wondering if we
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
could delay executing this bill and ask
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
for clarification from the odd fund
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
itself whether it would need an
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
amendment put on this to uh delay the re
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
requirement for the changes in the
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
funding until there was time to finish
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
administering doing it or whether they
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
internally we we can do that we have a
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
board meeting coming up at the end of
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
this month if you onund dis first report
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh that's too late they won't
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
fit we have to get the bill out before
 
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.910 align:start position:0%
fit we have to get the bill out before
then

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay we'll figure that out yeah all
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
right any other questions talk to the
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
local sponsors all right I'm going to

spills thank you representative duet
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarity Mr chairman uh the
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
issue we heard in the testimony is
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
apparently something that can be
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
addressed in any other body so uh
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
whatever concerns might be with the
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
this okay there is a concern yeah
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
represent El me
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the issue was possibly the my
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
understanding was the the date um and it
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
possibly can be handled within the um
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
the department but um if not then the
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
other body could potentially change that
 
01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
other body could potentially change that
uh

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
date there would have to be two
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
dates one that
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
extended the
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
the the uh life of the
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
program and then the second one uh to to
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
funding

01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that at this point the
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
people that are listening could go and
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
work on that issue in order to bring it
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
to the Senate because the Senate
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
it okay representative
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
Brier um it's my understanding that
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl sits on the oil fund
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
dispersement board and that um there's
 
01:35:12.199 --> 01:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
dispersement board and that um there's
the

01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
ability as uh represent El pointed out
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a uh there is two issues
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's the sunset it needs to that
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be straightened out immediately
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
but also uh the other piece is when the
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh the rates go to effect they just need
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
like you know my estimation be like 60
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
days to just clean up some of the
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff to notify everybody
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
and change the system and I believe that
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh that can be uh adjusted in the Senate
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
well and based on what we heard about
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
when this next meeting would be that
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
would fit in the time frame for the
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%

OTP vote yesterday so there's no need
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%

01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
piece okay anybody else yes represent El
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
somebody had a session yesterday he
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%

01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county has the same bill

same exact language okay and they did
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
what they unan unan iously got passed
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
out of committee ought to
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
pass I I have it right here
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative I can ship down your way
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
like anyone else
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's did someone amend
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
it did it get amended doing that's the
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment is what passed
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes and we don't have time to read it
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
but what are the differences between the
 
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.070 align:start position:0%
but what are the differences between the
two

01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we know the differences my
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the original
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
language did not cover the applicants
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
that are in the queue for the HHR so
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
they corrected that with the amendment
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
so it's doesn't add anybody but includes
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
everybody that's
 
01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.830 align:start position:0%
everybody that's
uh

01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
qualifies thank you I thought that that
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
but Mr chairman yes repres I I just took
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
a a thank you I just took a quick look
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
online and unless the amendment changes
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
the language it says it only authorizes
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
a referendum regarding historic horse
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
racing I
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
think is that all that's covered under
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
chance let's uh why don't we take five
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
minutes to look at that Amendment
 
01:46:37.679 --> 01:46:39.709 align:start position:0%
minutes to look at that Amendment
yeah

01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't what
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
cop yeah it there's it says games of
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
chance versus horse racing and they're
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
not the same
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
correct the
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
amendment they are't the same not sure
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the but on as far as I'm concerned
 
01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:00.170 align:start position:0%
that's an
 
01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
that's an
[Music]

01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
improvement because a lot of people find
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
game um what
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
would would it repres elberger would
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%

01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%

Municipal and County
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh negated the need for this bill but
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
there are there other reasons that this
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
portions of
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
hb2 which are pertinent to Ways and
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay um and I guess lastly I heard uh
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
some uh desire to have a field trip to
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh the Nash um and um I know the local
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
NASA people were thinking about doing
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
that but maybe it's good for the full
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee um how do people I guess by a
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
show of hands who would be interested
 
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.030 align:start position:0%
show of hands who would be interested
in

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
food no we don't we don't have it
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled it's just um you know it would
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
be a field the Nash is a

01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding on the the way
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
that it's being set up to review hb2 is
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
is that it's reviewing only the revenues
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
and estimates not yeah not the policy
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be whatever it
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
