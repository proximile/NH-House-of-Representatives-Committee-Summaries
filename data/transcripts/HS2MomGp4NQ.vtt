00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.869 align:start position:0%
i've seen a presentation that they have
given

00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
to uh house finance but other
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
groups of people i'll see if they would
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
be willing to come and give that same
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
presentation to us
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
i can't give you a date for that but
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let's uh talk briefly about the
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
okay so let's uh talk briefly about the
agenda

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman excuse me uh
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative harrington you have a
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
question yeah sorry to interrupt i was
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
just thinking those those handouts
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
we got from the governor's people last
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
week maybe if they could be distributed
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee that would be a good uh
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
step to charts that they gave us because
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
that 65 pages is pretty confusing
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
those handouts uh might be helpful for
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
to get you know the ones i'm referring
 
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
to get you know the ones i'm referring
to

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good suggestion representative
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
harrington i don't have those
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
slides in an electronic format at the
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
moment but i can try to get them from
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you'd like i can get them and just
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
distribute them
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh some of the others
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
like me i haven't seen it so they could
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
be distributed to the committee as a
 
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
be distributed to the committee as a
whole

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
as i just indicated to representative
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
harrington i will do my best to make
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
i do not have them in electronic format
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the way most people receive
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
information from the committee these
 
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.870 align:start position:0%

if you'd like i could get those for it
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
and then distribute them mr chairman
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%

now about the agenda for today i have
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
made arrangements
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
to get a couple of folks from
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
iso new england to come and talk to us
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock this morning
 
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock this morning
about

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the transmission system in new england
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to explain to us just
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
exactly how
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
they administer the transmission
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
network in new england and they're going
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
to explain to us
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the impacts are of
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency renewable energy on
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
they will be here at 10 o'clock i
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
believe they're available
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
until about 11 30 and
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
they'll give us a presentation and then
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
they'll take our questions so we'll have
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of time
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
to ask them questions about
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
transmission costs which is an important
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
topic that comes up
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
over and over in our public hearings and
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
our other discussions so i think it's
 
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
our other discussions so i think it's
worthwhile

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
to see what uh iso new england has to
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
say on that topic so we'll do that
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock between now and then we
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
transact some business as i indicated
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
in an email that i said to all of you
 
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
in an email that i said to all of you
earlier

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
we did discover a typo
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment we adopted to house
 
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
in the amendment we adopted to house
bill

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
315 it was a simple
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
one-word strikethrough of the word
 
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
one-word strikethrough of the word
provide

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
but that's an important part of the
 
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.269 align:start position:0%
but that's an important part of the
amendment

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
and we really need to fix that
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
error so i have asked it osos to draft a
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
new amendment
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
which i sent to you all it's 2021-0748
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
h and um what i would like to do this
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
morning is open an
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
executive session on hp315
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
i will make a motion to reconsider
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
hp315 if that motion passes i will then
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment 2021-0748
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
h and presumably that will pass
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
well i haven't opened the executive
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
session yet
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'll call make sure to call and you've
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
got representative kelly fitz
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that's the main piece of
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
business that i would like to conduct
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
between now
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
and 10 o'clock i had originally hoped
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to have a working
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
session today
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
on house bill 106.
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately after we retained that
 
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.030 align:start position:0%
unfortunately after we retained that
bill

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
i did not explicitly
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
enough apparently say to the clerk and
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee admin
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to hold on to that and the
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill got transmitted to the house clerk
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
as retained and that apparently is an
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
action that cannot be retracted
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
or undone i had a lengthy
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
telephone conversation with the house
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and he
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
explained to me that we can no longer
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
take any action on house bill 106
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
until the speaker gives us permission
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
deal with retained bills so
 
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
deal with retained bills so
unfortunately

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to bring
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
forth any amendments on hb 106 this
 
00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.509 align:start position:0%
forth any amendments on hb 106 this
morning

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
we can't even really discuss it because
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker hasn't given us
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
permission to discuss virginia's bills
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
i will point out however that senate
 
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.430 align:start position:0%
i will point out however that senate
bill

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
109 which should arrive
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
in our committee in another week or two
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
is very very similar to house bill 106
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we will get a second bite at that
 
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
so we will get a second bite at that
apple

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
apple
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
and we can hopefully come up with a
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
compromise position on senate bill 109.
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
that we can all live with and that the
 
00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
that we can all live with and that the
senate

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
will accept so we will plan to have a
 
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
will accept so we will plan to have a
lengthy

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about that bill of course
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a public hearing on it as
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
well and
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
then we'll have a work session and we'll
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
try to come up with a way to
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
create a compromise that makes as many
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
people happy
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
as possible so that's the plan
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative samson you have a
 
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative samson you have a
question

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you mr chair um
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
well i'm really disappointed that we
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
can't uh talk about hp
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
106 today um as you well know you you
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
assured us that we would have that
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity and you would retain this
 
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.710 align:start position:0%
opportunity and you would retain this
bill

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i can certainly understand that
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
mistakes can be made
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
however it is um an issue that has come
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
up in the house sessions as well
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
where i believe the speaker has made
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
several mistakes where
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
the remedy seemed to be uh i apologize
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
for my mistake but i can't revert
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
or mitigate those mistakes i think these
 
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
or mitigate those mistakes i think these
are

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
these are acts that tend to uh generate
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of mistrust
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a it's not a good thing
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
for us we should be generating more
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
trust among each other
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
and not mistrust so i'm disappointed
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
about this and i think it it
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't do us very much uh good here
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
that these things happen and when they
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
do happen
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
they must be a media remediation effort
 
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
they must be a media remediation effort
done

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
and if the only remediation is to say
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
sorry we made a mistake
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
you can't do anything about it that's
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
not that's not very satisfactory
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative samson
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
i did apologize to the committee in my
 
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.110 align:start position:0%
i did apologize to the committee in my
email

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the mistake that caused the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
miscommunity education that caused this
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
mistake i'll apologize again
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
here in person making that mistake
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
and in my defense i'll point out that
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a new committee chair
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
we have a new committee clerk we have a
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
new committee vice chair
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it's inevitable that a mistake is
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen on occasion
 
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:47.870 align:start position:0%
it's also inevitable given the
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
it's also inevitable given the
[Music]

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
in which we are conducting our business
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
where i haven't even
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
spoken in person to our committee admin
 
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.190 align:start position:0%
since the
 
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:03.189 align:start position:0%
since the
[Music]

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
glitches like this and
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
i apologize once again for the fact that
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
but it did happen so now we just have to
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative flett you're yes i would
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
just say
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
that the circumstances under which we
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
are living this year
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
with the covent situation does not
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
help communications at all and so uh
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh the mistake that was made is
 
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
i think uh the mistake that was made is
understandable

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
and uh i i won't want to dwell on it and
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
i just remember the last two years with
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
lots of stuff i didn't
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
just leave it there thank you
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
all i wanted to say was i i had called
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
the clerk on this
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
and that is irreversible and that
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think that in this committee we
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
we are polite to each other but i think
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
we have to pay
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
more attention to each other instead of
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to think ahead and i think that's
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
normal under these circumstances with
 
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
normal under these circumstances with
zoom

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i thank god we're all human because
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've all made mistakes and we will
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.990 align:start position:0%
we've all made mistakes and we will
probably

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
continue to make mistakes but we will be
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with 106
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
in september or before if the speaker
 
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
in september or before if the speaker
allows

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%

that this amendment is the correct one
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
the honorable clifton bureau of the city

amendment is the correct one henry
herndon

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
herndon
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
of clean energy new hampshire has also
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
verified that this
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is the correct one i have been
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
through it myself
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i verify that it is the
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that we all agreed to in our
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process to develop this
 
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.430 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process to develop this
amendment

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
for this bill does anyone else have any
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
comments that they would like to make
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment i thought i saw
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
your hand go up
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i i muted myself when i
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
thought i unmuted myself
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh first uh henry herndon is no longer
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
with clean energy new hampshire
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
he's with the uh i believe it's called
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
the community power alliance
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
and secondly i i know for my part i
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
a typo or or missed the typo i thought
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
that was part of the compromise
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i bring this up because when we have
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
these continual amendments
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
and we bring in an outside authority
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
such as cliff below it's all too easy to
 
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.669 align:start position:0%
such as cliff below it's all too easy to
assume

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
that the changes that were made are
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
are the ones that have been vetted and i
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
i just i i just i
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate that how careful we
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
when we have multi-page amendments
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that one came in the
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
morning of
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
the the session where we considered it
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
did it not
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
no that's not correct uh that was sent
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
to you at least
 
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:23.380 align:start position:0%
three or four days ahead of time
 
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
three or four days ahead of time
[Music]

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay just then as a final point as we go
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
forward it would be really useful if we
 
00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:30.149 align:start position:0%
forward it would be really useful if we
always

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
try to have these out several days
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that people do have
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
time to to really give them the
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
fine-tooth comb because
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
trying to read over this to ensure that
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
provide really was
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the only change was a a really uh
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
difficult task thank you
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i will say that
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
the stakeholder process involves a lot
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we had multiple versions of the
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
in that kind of a situation it's easy
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
for this kind of mistake to get made
 
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
for this kind of mistake to get made
unfortunately

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
i could have left that mistake
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
i could have let it ride and ask the
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
senate to fix it
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
but that just didn't seem right to me if
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
we know we have a mistake it's our bill
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
it seems to me it's up to us to fix the
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
mistake not try to pass that
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
task off to somebody else so that's why
 
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
task off to somebody else so that's why
i

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
re-adopt the amendment and adopt the
 
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.149 align:start position:0%
re-adopt the amendment and adopt the
correctness

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%

telephone conversation yesterday before
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
because i was wondering about possibly
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting in
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:55.990 align:start position:0%
some expert speakers that we could begin
to

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%

be coming up on retain bill would that
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
be possible during this
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
interim period that we have before us
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes in fact we're doing we're starting
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
that process today
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
by having a presentation on transmission
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
costs by
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
iso new england and sausage
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
has and i have been discussing the
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of bringing in some folks
 
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
possibility of bringing in some folks
who

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
understand the intricacies of
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
financing renewable energy projects
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
to explain to us just exactly how those
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
projects get
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
financed and put together i think that
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
would be useful information for the
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee to have
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
and as soon as we can pull that together
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
arrange a work session for us to to have
 
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.470 align:start position:0%
arrange a work session for us to to have
that

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
have that discussion it's just slight
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
difference here that i i was trying to
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that i wasn't stepping on any
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
toes that
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
these are presentations on general
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
topics whereas
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
say the broadband bill if we wanted to
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody come in and talk to us
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
about broadband
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
if we might be out of order because we
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
were discussing
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
something that was in a retained bill
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
and we had not yet received permission
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
to do so from the speaker
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that it's okay
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
to proceed with
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
inviting such experts and then try to
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
set up a time
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
would that be with you or would that be
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
with the clerk or the vice
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
chair i would it would go through me
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
and we can do that as you suggest
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative thomas
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i would work together
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh along with representative samsic to
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
make those events happen
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
we'll try to put some of those together
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
i will alert you though to the fact that
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
very soon now we will start receiving
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
bills from the senate
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
and once we receive those bills we'll
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
start scheduling public hearings for
 
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
start scheduling public hearings for
those

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
bills so that we can take care of that
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
business as
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible so that may
 
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.430 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible so that may
delay

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
if you will any discussions we have with
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
outside experts about other issues but
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
we'll work it all in as best we can over
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the course of the next
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
few weeks and we'll get our work done
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
have a question about it speaking of
 
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:27.829 align:start position:0%
have a question about it speaking of
that

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
i would remind you all that the speaker
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
has scheduled
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
three house sessions for april 7 8
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
and nine which are our wednesday
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
thursday and friday
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
a friday session is unusual but not
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
unprecedented according to the speaker
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
and all three of those sessions will be
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
held at the
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
bedford sports complex
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
same place we met on february 24th
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
and 25th and the speaker has indicated
 
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
and 25th and the speaker has indicated
that

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
the session we had there on the 24th and
 
00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
the session we had there on the 24th and
25th

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
25th
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
uncovered some issues
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
with being able to hear
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
participants who are spread out over
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
such such a large area
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
and so the speaker's office is trying to
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
take actions to allow
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
all persons in attendance at the
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
sessions on
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
april 7 8 9 to be able to be recognized
 
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:30.829 align:start position:0%
april 7 8 9 to be able to be recognized
and

00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
heard whenever they
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
want to speak so hopefully we will avoid
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
problems that we had on february 24th
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
and 25th representative mcgee
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i just had a
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
question uh i had heard recently
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
normally we have a a budget overview
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the house before we have to vote on
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i know that there's a sort of a
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
question floating out there so i was
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
if you had heard anything in leadership
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
about whether we will have a review
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
of what's in the budget before we have
 
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.829 align:start position:0%
of what's in the budget before we have
to

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.069 align:start position:0%
 
vote

00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any specific talk about
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
that uh i do know from past experience
 
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
that uh i do know from past experience
that

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
there will be a budget presentation
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
but i haven't it hasn't been scheduled
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
yet for my knowledge
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
when it will be scheduled i don't i'm
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
not sure if we will be voting on the
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
budget on april 7
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
8 or 9. that's not clear to me but
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'll try to get an answer to that
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
question and get back to you
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
another thing that that we all need to
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to the session coming up on
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
april 7
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
8 and 9 is that we need
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be careful with our floor debates
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
we have an awful lot of bills to deal
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
with and a lot of ground to cover
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
on those three days and while apparently
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
we have that facility
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
from nine in the morning till six in the
 
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
from nine in the morning till six in the
evening

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
it still may not be enough time if we
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
get carried away with our floor debates
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
so i would urge everyone on the
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
plan carefully your floor debates
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that your floor speeches are
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
as succinct
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
as possible make your
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
one two or three points as quickly as
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
so that the events of the day can move
 
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:42.309 align:start position:0%
so that the events of the day can move
along

00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
an expeditious fashion we don't
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
really i don't think benefit from
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
long force people
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
already made up their mind about how
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote before we get to
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people say they pay more
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
pis than they do before speeches so i
 
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.430 align:start position:0%
pis than they do before speeches so i
just

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
ask everybody to think about that as
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
they plan their floor speeches
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming session
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have isd iso new
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
england here in about
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
20 minutes are there any topics that any
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
of you would like to discuss
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none i guess maybe we can uh take
 
00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
seeing none i guess maybe we can uh take
a

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
a break let's take a 15 minute break
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
and reassemble at five minutes of
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
10. each time we will begin the
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
presentation by
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%

yeah there's there's like a background
like

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
hum still there right like yeah it's
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
still there
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm by myself in a room there's
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
nothing around it might be something
 
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
nothing around it might be something
electronics

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
electronics
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'll check it out again thanks
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
thanks my suspicion on that might be it
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
might be coming
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the uh desk in the chambers
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh somebody is not close the mic right
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
now but when they start
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps when they move up the
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
microphone that goes away
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i suspect it's from the chambers but
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
good luck cutting it down
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
first first time i did it from home so
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
and i might be stepping away if i have a
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
phone call so
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
good day okay how you doing
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
louis is it louis lucious
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
delicious yes hey tell me something are
 
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
delicious yes hey tell me something are
you

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
new this year yes i am how are you
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
finding the experience
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
the thing i'm liking is i used to be in
 
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
the thing i'm liking is i used to be in
research

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
and getting these bills going through
 
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.750 align:start position:0%
and getting these bills going through
everything

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
that's what i like but um
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to step trying to stay away
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
from this pretty
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
partisanship well
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of feeling the same way i gotta
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
be honest it is a wake-up call walking
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
into that hall
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
and hearing a lot of that i'd like to
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
think that i would like to think of a
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
fair-minded i guess
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
but uh boy there's a lot to learn though
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
i feel like i mean personally i don't
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
know if you feel that way it's a
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
lot of information coming down on this
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes i've been going to a lot of uh
 
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.589 align:start position:0%
yes i've been going to a lot of uh
former

00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
former
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
reps so i don't bias
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
myself with the ones voting this year
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i reached out to some of the former
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
reps and especially my district
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i thought i was going to be in
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and it was a fit for me and this one so
 
00:52:59.040 --> 00:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
and it was a fit for me and this one so
i

00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
came here so
 
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
came here so
[Music]

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
where are you from again what town i'm
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
in center harbor representing um
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
that new hampton belknap one
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah once again my mic is that
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
still working
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
is your what uh my microphone i had
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
background noise
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm still hurting oh but i don't that's
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
you or not
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay it's when it's when you don't talk
 
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
okay it's when it's when you don't talk
like

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's like a background hum okay that
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
kicks in and it overrides the room
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
mic so we can't hear when he's calling
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i couldn't hear my bull coming
 
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:39.589 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i couldn't hear my bull coming
through

00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
when i was waiting so that was probably
 
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
when i was waiting so that was probably
why

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's a setting they can do on a zoom
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
where you can uh
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
select how much background noise you
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
allow yeah i tried all three of them it
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to change it
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's why i asked a few times
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
but nothing seemed to change it even if
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's still there
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
now if i'm quite a
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
maybe need a little cradle for your
 
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.510 align:start position:0%
maybe need a little cradle for your
microphone

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
oh i don't need multiple
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm expecting a phone i was asked
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
to stay by my phone today for family
 
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
to stay by my phone today for family
business

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's why i'm here then i see
 
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.710 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's why i'm here then i see
that

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
the room it's almost empty so i wasn't
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
the only one
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think people look into a short day
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
today i don't know if we're gonna go
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
past noon
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know i
 
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know i
[Music]

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's right i was thinking of uh 106
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
was going to be discussed too and i
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
forgot it was uh
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
caught into being retained yeah that was
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
it was a disappointment but
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah my notes i had both of them so i
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
forgot about that
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
isn't that funny i was just going to say
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
note to self if we vote to retain
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is going to be retained we
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have voted
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know we should have left it in
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee if we really wanted to leave
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
it in committee
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
but um yeah i hope that we get to ask
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
more from the iso new england just about
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
the transmission costs i want to learn
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
about that but there's a lot more
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
like grid security and stability and
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
what you know
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
what percent of renewables on the system
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
creates instability like they do
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
reporting on all kinds of really
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
interesting topics
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we should be more informed on so i
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
i hope it's not just limited to
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
that although our transmission our
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of the transmission costs has
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so i also would like to know what
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
that 10.5 or 10.8
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
equates to in dollars because
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
um we should understand that i think
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee it's
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
my experience in dealing with iso new
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
england that
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
when they're asked to give a
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
presentation about a particular subject
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's all they prepare for so hopefully
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
we can stick to the transmission portion
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
of there
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh because if we ask other uh
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
diverse questions that that person may
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
not have been the one
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
to to deal in that so we um
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
but if we want to have more information
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they would say they can get
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
someone else to come in and
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
answer some questions also in the past
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
before if we've had more questions
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we have been asked to submit them
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that they would get back to us as
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
well so hopefully that will
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
that will be the case this time yeah i'm
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure they'll be able to field whatever
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
question i mean if we get an answer we
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't get an answer but
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right let's uh let's get started
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
again excuse me
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
brad greenland are you there
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes i am brad would you elevate
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
mr johnson or maybe you already did you
 
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.430 align:start position:0%
mr johnson or maybe you already did you
haven't

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay mr johnson is there okay
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
so we can now
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i will ask eric johnson from
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
iso to take the floor
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
and uh talk to us about
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
transmission costs in new england
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
how they're allocated amongst the states
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
and how they affect energy efficiency
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
and renewable energy in our state
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
so mr johnson welcome to the
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house science technology
 
00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:08.710 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house science technology
and

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
energy committee we look forward to uh
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
hearing from you this morning
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
and you are free to take it away
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you much very much
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
good to see you just want to do a quick
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
audio check can you hear me clearly we
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
can thank you
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
all right sounds good uh i dialed in uh
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes before i was
 
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.630 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes before i was
introduced

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
i understand there's a interest in a few
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
other topics i'll do my best to answer
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
those today or
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
follow up as needed to assist the
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.069 align:start position:0%
follow up as needed to assist the
committee

00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
for the uh record my name is eric
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
johnson i'm director of
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
external affairs for iso new england
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
based in holyoke
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i i miss the opportunity to wake up
 
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
and i i miss the opportunity to wake up
at

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
five in the morning to make the trip to
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
concord but hopefully
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future we'll be
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
back and grab a cup of coffee across the
 
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.470 align:start position:0%
back and grab a cup of coffee across the
street

00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
and visit you in person i was asked to
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
talk about transmission costs how
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're allocated
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
to the states and when we talk about
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
transmission just to clarify we're
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bulk transmission system which is
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
the high voltage
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
wires in the region we're not
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the poles and wires in the
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
local community which make up the
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
distribution system so i just want to
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
set that distinction
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
the transmission costs are not
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
allocated uh directly to the states so i
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that clear
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
up front we we can show an approximation
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
of what that is
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
on a state-by-state basis and i think
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to see
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
what that looks like region wide we've
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
prevented presented a similar
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh set of data in the past but currently
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
if you think of the allocation of the
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
cost it's based on something called the
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
network load in the region
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially the amount of
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
electricity that's being
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
consumed across the new england electric
 
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.870 align:start position:0%
consumed across the new england electric
grid

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
grid
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
and our grid is a tightly integrated
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
system so everything from
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
maine to connecticut and all the states
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
are in between
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
are interconnected and then we have
 
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.990 align:start position:0%
are interconnected and then we have
interconnections

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
interconnections
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
to our neighbors but we're only talking
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
about the transmission system within
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
the new england borders and so the
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
network load for new hampshire for 2019
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
was 9.5 percent
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
now that number is relatively constant
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
over time we don't see
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
significant shifts in the regional
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
significant shifts in the regional
network

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
load in any of the states
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
i'll give you the numbers for the other
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
states and i'm happy to provide this in
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
writing if it's helpful
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i mentioned new hampshire is 9.5
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
connecticut is 25.5 percent
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is the largest at 45.8
 
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.030 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is the largest at 45.8
percent

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
vermont at 4 percent
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
rhode island at 6.3 percent
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
in maine at 8.9
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
so if you think of those percentages the
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
largest would be massachusetts
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
followed by connecticut followed by
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire followed by maine then
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
rhode island in vermont
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
transmission relates to the renewables
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and if you think about
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
the renewables that are coming onto the
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
system in new england we have
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
large scale grid connected resources
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
those could be a gas fire generation
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
which we've seen over the past decade or
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
more recently we're seeing
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
wind-based projects onshore and offshore
 
01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:00.710 align:start position:0%
wind-based projects onshore and offshore
wind

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
wind
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
projects that are grid connected the
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
large generators
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
they don't tend to impact
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
the regional network load because they
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
come onto the grid as
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
supply they're putting power onto the
 
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
supply they're putting power onto the
system

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
but we also see a lot of distributed
 
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.349 align:start position:0%
but we also see a lot of distributed
resources

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
across the region and much of that is
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
solar right now the pv resources
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
and you can think of the rooftop solar
 
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
and you can think of the rooftop solar
arrays

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
arrays
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
most of those are being sponsored by uh
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
state incentive programs
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
so a customer would put a solar
 
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
so a customer would put a solar
installation

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
installation
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
on their home or their building
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that does not look like supply to
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
the iso it looks like
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
a reduction in electricity demand so we
 
01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
a reduction in electricity demand so we
would

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
generally say they are behind the meter
 
01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.829 align:start position:0%
generally say they are behind the meter
resources

01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
so as we are managing the electricity
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
consumption on the grid
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see that the the grid
 
01:03:03.599 --> 01:03:04.150 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see that the the grid
demand

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
drops on a day when you have
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
sunshine like today as the
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
customers who would normally be using
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
power from the grid are now
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
sourcing some of their energy directly
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
directly from those solar resources
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
and so it looks like a reduction in the
 
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
and so it looks like a reduction in the
demand

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
on the grid so the regional network load
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
coming back to that concept
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
the large scale grid connected resources
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't have an impact
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
but the smaller resources would the
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
behind the meter resources would so they
 
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
behind the meter resources would so they
would

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
in effect reduce the load on the system
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the ways it would have
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
an impact you could also draw
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
a similar correlation to an energy
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency which
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
like rooftop solar is an installation of
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
a device or a measure
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
on the customer side of the meter and
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
when you roll up all of the energy
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency across new england
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
to the iso it looks like a reduction in
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
demand on the grid just the way it does
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
customer who's installed typically a
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
lighting system or could be a chiller at
 
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
lighting system or could be a chiller at
a

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
larger facility so those are some of the
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
initial thoughts on the concept of how
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
costs are allocated
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
not directly to the states but we can
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
roll up the charges
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the states incur and you can think
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
state like connecticut would have two
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
customers for transmission primarily
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
it would be eversource and united
 
01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:44.309 align:start position:0%
it would be eversource and united
illuminating

01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
illuminating
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then in new hampshire it would be
 
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
and then in new hampshire it would be
psnh

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
psnh
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
and any of the other utilities operating
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the state and then we roll up
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities in each state to
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
give you the figures that i had
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
so the iso doesn't have a way to bill
 
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.150 align:start position:0%
so the iso doesn't have a way to bill
states

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
we allocate these costs uh to the
 
01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
we allocate these costs uh to the
utilities

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
they collect the revenue that they need
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
through a rate that's approved by the
 
01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
through a rate that's approved by the
ferc

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
ferc
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
the federal energy regulatory commission
 
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.950 align:start position:0%
the federal energy regulatory commission
so

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh that is not set by the iso uh the iso
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh a settle provides a settlement
 
01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh a settle provides a settlement
function

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
of of collecting those costs and
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
we would make the payments to the
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
transmission companies that have made
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
the investments
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the transmission system so i know
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
there were some other questions but
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think i could maybe stop there and see
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
if that
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
is helpful and if you want to expand or
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
ask any other related questions
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative plett is
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman uh eric great
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
to see you again
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
for hear from you anyway um
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's been i used to go to isilon
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
newport meetings um some
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
states are trying to increase net
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
metering in an attempt that
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
transmission costs a transition cost but
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
an attempt to reduce the percentage
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
from that from a particular state so
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
class shift the burden is on other
 
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:18.789 align:start position:0%
class shift the burden is on other
states

01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying any attempt like
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
that hasn't really been successful
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty steady is that
 
01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:25.750 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty steady is that
correct

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
um well first of all representative
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
plett it's nice to see you
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
and to address you as representative
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
having worked with you at the
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
many of the regional stakeholder
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
meetings i don't see you on camera so i
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
assume you might be in the large
 
01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:39.029 align:start position:0%
assume you might be in the large
building

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah large medium okay very good you
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
don't see me on camera
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
if we think about energy efficiency
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts historically has been
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
ranked first in the country and they've
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
been back and forth in first place with
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
california for
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
investments in energy efficiency and
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do that to make sure
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're more efficient
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
and controlling their energy consumption
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
and giving customers tools to do
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
that so they would be one of the most
 
01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
that so they would be one of the most
aggressive

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of the state policy for
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
implementing energy efficiency but they
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be doing that
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
based on their their own objectives
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's no requirements
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
at the iso level for states to invest
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
in energy efficiency or take actions
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
like that that might affect the
 
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.029 align:start position:0%
like that that might affect the
transmission

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
costs so we may observe
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
that some states spend more than others
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
on energy efficiency but
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have a direct role in that now
 
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
we don't have a direct role in that now
it

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
is possible and this is i'm just kind of
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
if if some of the states in the region
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
invest heavily in transmission in energy
 
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.390 align:start position:0%
invest heavily in transmission in energy
efficiency

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
and others don't invest in energy
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency you could see
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
a shift in the cost because they would
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
be in effect reducing
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh the regional network load within
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
their state
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
but we've seen a lot of investment in
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency for
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
many many years in the region and we
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen these numbers
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh shift dramatically so i think you
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
have to make your own
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
determination on whether or not there's
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
a cost
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
shift for the investments that are made
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
in any one technology whether it's
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
efficiency or
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
solar pv oh
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
if there were a concerted effort by a
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
particular state
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
to reduce its uh pro rata share of the
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
transmission by
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh aggressive uh net metering behind
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh would iso new england let that
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
stand or would it
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
redefine how the uh voters how the
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
transmission is out here
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we do not have a role in
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
that uh as i mentioned
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
our our only role in this space is to
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
provide the settlement function so the
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
money would be collected
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh by the iso and then it would be paid
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the companies that are
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
building the transmission and operating
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
the transmission system
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned the rates for the
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
regional network service are all
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
subject to uh review and approval by fur
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
so they're developed by the transmission
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
owners it goes to ferc
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's information about it that's
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
posted on the iso website
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we provide the settlement which is
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
just the
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
exchange of money it's a transaction
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any policy in this
 
01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:49.430 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any policy in this
area

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh mr johnson i have a
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
we hear in testimony before this
 
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.709 align:start position:0%
we hear in testimony before this
committee

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
over and over again that the adoption of
 
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.669 align:start position:0%
over and over again that the adoption of
certain

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
policies regarding energy efficiency or
 
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
policies regarding energy efficiency or
renewable

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
energy reduces our transmission
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
load and therefore our transmission
 
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
load and therefore our transmission
costs

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
is there any way to measure
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
those reduced costs and or that reduced
 
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
those reduced costs and or that reduced
load

01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
we do publish the monthly
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
regional network load data and we've
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
shared that with a committee in the past
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe uh
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
chairman that's a file that you had
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
shared with us in advance
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
asking for some uh perspectives on
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it's publicly available
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
and what you could do is look back in
 
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
and what you could do is look back in
time

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire's share of the
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
network load relative to each of the
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
so the numbers i gave you are a annual
 
01:10:55.679 --> 01:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
so the numbers i gave you are a annual
snapshot

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
snapshot
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the region but you can look at that
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
but the trend over over many years is
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuation month to month but there
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
could be other things
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
driving that as well it could be
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
variations in the weather within the
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
region that drive
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
the consumption in southern new england
 
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:20.790 align:start position:0%
the consumption in southern new england
versus

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
some of the northern new england states
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
there there may be other factors so
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to draw out an inference that
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency explicitly is causing
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
the changes in the regional network load
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
you would have to make some assumptions
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
to unpack that data
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
the information we're showing is simply
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
what we see on
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
we can't look behind the meter to figure
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
out how much is energy efficiency
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
versus how much is you know other things
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
so if i understood you correctly you're
 
01:11:58.719 --> 01:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
so if i understood you correctly you're
saying

01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i have looked at that monthly load
 
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.950 align:start position:0%
and i have looked at that monthly load
data

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there are a variety
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
of causes
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
to explain the
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
ups and downs on a monthly basis
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
of the load some of it could be
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy or energy efficiency
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
but other
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
reasons could include the weather and
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
other variables is that what i heard you
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative mcgee
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
johnson for coming to speak with us
 
01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
johnson for coming to speak with us
today

01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
my question is how the iso new england
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
views the
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
load reduction from behind the meter
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
assets in terms of grid reliability
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
because i know you you put out reports
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
very often that's your primary charge
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
as an iso and i just wondered how
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
how those changes in the management of
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
are perceived by the iso because i think
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
one of the conversations that comes up
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of policy making is
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's the threshold for
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
renewables coming onto the grid at which
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's no longer of the benefit that we
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
all think it is
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that those conversations are
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
going on all over the country so i'm
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
just curious if you could speak to
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
the reliability piece and how you view
 
01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:24.870 align:start position:0%
the reliability piece and how you view
um

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
those assets coming online in terms of
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're now able to all talk of
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
them as load reducers
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
but how much load reduction
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
can we sustain and how do you guys view
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
it in terms of the stability of the grid
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative mcgee a good
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
question right reliability really is job
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
one for us
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh from the time that we were created as
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
organization it was to
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
make sure we operate and plan the system
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
reliably for the
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
six new england states when we think
 
01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.630 align:start position:0%
six new england states when we think
about

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
renewables we don't think of renewables
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
any differently than
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
any other technology that would come
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
onto the grid
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we we take our independence
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh very seriously we're technology
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
neutral when it comes to resources
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
so any any resource that wants to tie
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
into the bulk power system
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
we would study the interconnection of
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
that project
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
and you may have heard of the uh the
 
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
and you may have heard of the uh the
queue

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
queue
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
that the iso maintains the generator
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
interconnection study queue
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's like when you go to the deli and
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
you want to place your order you pull a
 
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.149 align:start position:0%
you want to place your order you pull a
number

01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
and you get your q position and so we do
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
that for every project that wants to tie
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
into the grid
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
historically those have been the large
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
gas-fired plants but now we're seeing
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
that for
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
wind farms and we're starting to see it
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
for some large
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
solar arrays in the region so
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
when a project comes forward we want to
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
study it to make sure that it will have
 
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:56.790 align:start position:0%
study it to make sure that it will have
no

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on the reliability of the
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the grid
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
or anybody connected to it so
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
the test is no adverse impact
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
and if we do detect that there are
 
01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
and if we do detect that there are
problems

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
we could require the developer to
 
01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
we could require the developer to
upgrade

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
substations or transmission facilities
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
in the area to make sure it can connect
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
reliably we don't want anybody plugging
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
into the grid
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and causing problems for other entities
 
01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
and causing problems for other entities
so

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's been part of our responsibility
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
since the beginning
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
it continues to be and we wouldn't let a
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
asset of any kind
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
connect to the grid if it would cause
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
reliability problems
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
but if you think about the small
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
distributed resources
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
the solar pv we don't have any decision
 
01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.110 align:start position:0%
the solar pv we don't have any decision
making

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
in that area at all we simply see
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
the load reduction and there's no
 
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
the load reduction and there's no
resource

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
resource
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's wired into our system
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
it just shows up as the reduction so
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
if you think about the typical load
 
01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:01.510 align:start position:0%
if you think about the typical load
profile

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
profile
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the region everybody wakes up you
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
know in the in the early morning hours
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the demand for power builds
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the day
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the challenges that we see
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
with operating a system with growing
 
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
with operating a system with growing
penetration

01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
penetration
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
of solar pv resources is that you are
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
increasing the ramp of power that you
 
01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:23.830 align:start position:0%
increasing the ramp of power that you
need

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon as the solar goes
 
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon as the solar goes
offline

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
offline
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
so we're able to manage that uh there's
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's always been a ramp between the
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and the evening but
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
because the solar pv has brought the
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
demand on the grid down
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
so significantly on a sunny day it's
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
created a steeper
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
ramp to the evening peak so we need to
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
make sure we have resources that are
 
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
make sure we have resources that are
flexible

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
and fast enough to be able to come on as
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
the solar
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
is going offline and if you'll pardon me
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
for just one minute
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
i have to go let the dog out i'm sorry
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
be right back
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
he he's in charge right now okay
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative thomas will be recognized
 
01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.310 align:start position:0%
representative thomas will be recognized
next

01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.030 align:start position:0%
next
[Music]

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas go ahead and
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
well is uh mr johnson back ready to hear
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
no oh yes yes i'm here
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um yes uh this
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh deviates slightly from the subject
 
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh deviates slightly from the subject
but

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned reliability my question
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
involves in terms of the pandemic and
 
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
involves in terms of the pandemic and
people

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
currently working more at home and in
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
terms of the fact that in the last
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
several years
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the new england region has done a lot
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
to increase its reliability through iso
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
new england there have been a lot of
 
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
new england there have been a lot of
projects

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
reliability projects that that have come
 
01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
reliability projects that that have come
on

01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
which of course all all of the states
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
do you see a ramping down
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
of those reliably reliability projects
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
coming soon and how
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
would you um how would you comment
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
on how they will be affecting the
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
overall electric bills of our of the
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
as these projects come down and also in
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
relationship to whether or not
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
you may see more people working from
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
home in terms of
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
use of electricity uh what the point i'm
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
getting at is
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
as we attempt to do some policy making
 
01:18:41.679 --> 01:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
as we attempt to do some policy making
to

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
try to reduce the cost of electricity to
 
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
try to reduce the cost of electricity to
our

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
constituents are we looking at skewed
 
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.430 align:start position:0%
constituents are we looking at skewed
data

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
and are we going to overreact or do you
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
where do you see that the states may
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
need to want to go
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of reducing people's electric
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
bills knowing that
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
all of these past data might be coming
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
down that we're at the tail end of these
 
01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:04.950 align:start position:0%
down that we're at the tail end of these
things

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
if you understand my question correctly
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of convoluted but
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving parts in there
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay maybe you could just clarify
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative thomas the the point
 
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
representative thomas the the point
about

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
reliability projects coming down i just
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i understood that
 
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.750 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i understood that
reference

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
mine there have been many projects
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
throughout new england
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
to improve reliability a case in point
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
recently in new hampshire was the
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley reliability project
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these projects were done
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of the big ice storm we had many
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
years ago uh
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
people needed people were without power
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
for many many
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
many days and uh a lot of reliability
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
efforts were done at the time to make
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
sure that didn't happen again
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the amount of
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
projects that
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
were being done uh have gone over the
 
01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:55.750 align:start position:0%
were being done uh have gone over the
hump

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
hump
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we're now on the downswing as far as
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
finishing up these projects
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
so perhaps there won't be as many
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
reliably projects being done
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
in within the region therefore the cost
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
of those projects will be coming down
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh is what i was getting at so where do
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
you see us going in the next
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
say two to three years in terms of
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
what we can do for policy making while
 
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.669 align:start position:0%
what we can do for policy making while
not

01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
using the past data as potentially
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
skewed data because
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh we we've been high in the region but
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh we've been high for many reasons you
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
know where do you see us
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
come coming forward are we going to be
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
overreacting or
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
or are we or should we be using that
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
past data
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
um to to judge where we need to go
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's helpful thanks for the
 
01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
okay that's helpful thanks for the
clarification

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
the the reliability projects that new
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
england has
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
invested in over the past decade uh
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
total about
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh 10 billion dollars round numbers and
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's the cost of building and then
 
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
that's the cost of building and then
maintaining

01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bulk power system and then the costs
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
of that are allocated
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the percentages we
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're coming uh really to the end of
 
01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
uh we're coming uh really to the end of
the

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
the build out of most of those
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
reliability projects
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
we have about two billion dollars of
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
projects that are still planned
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and part of our system we don't see
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
significant transmission required for
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
reliability beyond that
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
the the exception might be if we see the
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
retirement of a
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
large uh generating resource
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
that provided support to the grid in a
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
certain area we may have to
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
restudy the system without that asset
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that could trigger a need for
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
transmission we did see that in the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
boston area when the mystic generating
 
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:53.830 align:start position:0%
boston area when the mystic generating
units

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
retired so we had to make some
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
transmission reinforcements
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
but we are not going to see an
 
01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:01.990 align:start position:0%
but we are not going to see an
indefinite

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
indefinite
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
growth in reliability based projects
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's our current view we do expect
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
based on what the states
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the region are looking at for uh
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
renewable and clean energy there may be
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
a build out of transmission
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve those policy goals but that
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
would not be based on a reliability need
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
and those costs would not be shared
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
based on the reliability formula that we
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
the second observation i would make is
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic did
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
bring about a reduction in electricity
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
demand initially
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
so about a year ago in the march time
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
frame we saw
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
electric demand in the region drop by
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
three to five percent
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we weren't sure how that trend would
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
be sustained because we had no data
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
historically to show how the country and
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
the region responds to
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
a pandemic like this but we actually saw
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
the demand on the grid come back pretty
 
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.030 align:start position:0%
the demand on the grid come back pretty
significantly

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
and somewhat higher than expected when
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
it got warm
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the june and july time frame last
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
summer so we kind of rebounded
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
as a region in terms of the electricity
 
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.830 align:start position:0%
as a region in terms of the electricity
consumption

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
and you can imagine people left their
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
offices but you're still
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
seeing the electricity demand at the
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
office building at the same time
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
now all the employees are using
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
electricity at their home so
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
what happened in a sense is the
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
electricity demand just got spread
 
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
electricity demand just got spread
around

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
more and it's probably less efficient
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
than to have people power down at home
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then power up at the office
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
in effect we're powering up you know
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
multiple locations
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's just a reality for
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
the for the present hopefully that will
 
01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.709 align:start position:0%
the for the present hopefully that will
change

01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we do see us coming to the end of
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
the build out of the reliability project
 
01:23:59.280 --> 01:23:59.669 align:start position:0%
the build out of the reliability project
so

01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't see transmission costs
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
which have risen we don't expect those
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm looking at is is there
 
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.870 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm looking at is is there
a

01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
do you have projections that there will
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
be more
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
generation and power needed in in the
 
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
generation and power needed in in the
future

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
or will we soon be back to
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh pre-tran pre-transmission
 
01:24:38.159 --> 01:24:38.709 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh pre-tran pre-transmission
days

01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
and perhaps pre-pre pandemic days
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh or do you see a rise in the need for
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
for more generation good question
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
the the long-term forecast that we do is
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
updated every year
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the springtime and published on may
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
1st it's part of the forecast called the
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
capacity energy
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
load and transmission report the cell
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
report that looks out for 10 years
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
and we look at really two dimensions of
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
the forecast what's the peak
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
for the region and what's the total
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
energy consumption
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
across all 8760 hours in a year
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
and for both of those forecasts
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
we expect that the consumption will
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
essentially be flat for the region
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that's driven in large part by the
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
across the states and the solar pv
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
they've really brought down the demand
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
for power
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you look beyond the 10-year horizon
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating that as you electrify
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
transportation as you have more and more
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
people driving plug-in vehicles
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
that need to charge on the grid and as
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
you shift away from
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels for heating and building
 
01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.030 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels for heating and building
heating

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
heating
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
to electrification which i think is the
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
direction the region is
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
is headed that will add more demand to
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
the grid so i think we've been in a
 
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.070 align:start position:0%
the grid so i think we've been in a
period

01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the first 20 years of the iso where
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
we saw
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
steady growth and then it's leveling off
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
and then i expect it will grow again as
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
we electrify more and more
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
parts of our economy
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
oxendine is recognized for a question
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for taking
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
is it mr johnson or mr greenland
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
mr j eric johnson eric johnson thank you
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
very much as we we met
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
when we were all down at uh at iso thank
 
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
when we were all down at uh at iso thank
you

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
um if i could take us back to the
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
earlier discussion
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
um i i think we're we're left with
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
sort of two um two different ideas and
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
let me explain
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh that we've had presentations from des
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
as you know mike fitzgerald and chris
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
goblin and the chair of the air
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
divisions resource board
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and their uh numbers vary from yours and
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably because you have
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the broader
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
new england perspective whereas they
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
focus very
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
directly on what's happening in new
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
a court when we were in your offices
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
um down there in holyoke uh
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
we we were presented with graphs that
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
showed all the other states in new
 
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:31.669 align:start position:0%
showed all the other states in new
england

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
were decreasing total load
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
and decreasing peak demand and as you
 
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:37.910 align:start position:0%
and decreasing peak demand and as you
just

01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
suggested that had a lot to do with very
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
aggressive policies
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
um in favor of renewable energy and
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire was the outlier new
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire was still
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
increasing its load and increasing its
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
peak demand
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
um and it was pointed out to us there
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
and as i said by our des
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
experts that because of
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
the actions of others who are declining
 
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:05.910 align:start position:0%
the actions of others who are declining
in

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
load and peak and even if we were simply
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
to plateau
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
our usage we would still over time and
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is looking
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
forward not looking at historical
 
01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:19.030 align:start position:0%
forward not looking at historical
numbers

01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
we would necessarily have to be taking a
 
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
we would necessarily have to be taking a
larger

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
share of the total because
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
our share would be getting bigger and
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
as i i don't have the um you point out
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
nine point five percent has been our
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
sort of average usage they were
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we would be over
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
ten percent um and i believe that was
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the next five to ten years and that
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
with every one tenth of one percent that
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
that goes up we are talking about
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
additional millions of dollars in monies
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would have to be
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
provided out of new hampshire to make up
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
the share
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
that others would not have so that i
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
think that's where our questions about
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
effect of renewable energy um
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll i'll just leave it there if it
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
having provided that background to
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
the controversy within our committee um
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful to you
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
to revisit that uh the point that you
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
were making
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
is it does it it's inconsistent to think
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
that our share would stay the same
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
while all of our partners are decreasing
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
their load and decreasing their peak
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we are not yeah
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good observation i'm not
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
directly familiar with uh the data that
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
might have been presented by
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh des and if if they have information
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to look at it
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and compare it with what we've seen
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
we only are able to measure what's the
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
demand showing up on the transmission
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
system itself
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not as though we can see
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
load in layers where there's
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
in real time the demand for electricity
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then the impact of solar and then
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of energy efficiency it's not
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
metered that way and when you look into
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
our control room they have no visibility
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
on that so the i think the only way you
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
can get at this
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
is to do some some analysis after the
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
fact of how much you're spending
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
on energy efficiency and you probably
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
need to know what the other states are
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
spending on energy
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency and compare that to
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
your load so the the numbers would not
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
originate from the iso
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
other than what your total consumption
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
is i think that might be one of the
 
01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:47.510 align:start position:0%
is i think that might be one of the
challenges

01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
for us providing the answer to you but i
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with you offline
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
to examine any data that you have uh to
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
the extent that's helpful
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and i i also think the
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
notion of you looking at the historical
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
data and then
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
projecting forward i think that also may
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
be a bit of our
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
differences here yes thank you so much
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up with you all right
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsit is recognized
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
mr johnson for being here
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
and making yourself available
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
um you probably know that one of the
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the biggest discussion points here in
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to electric bills has been
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
the dramatic increase in transmission
 
01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
the dramatic increase in transmission
costs

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
and this is something that the
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative thomas mentioned
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
the i think over the last 10 years
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
the portion of our electric bill that
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
increasing most dramatically has been
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the energy fuel supply
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
costs are pretty low and they've been
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
stable in fact they've been going down
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
and but the transmission costs continue
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
to rise
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatically from a small amount
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 years ago to
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
a significant amount right now so
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent thomas was asking just a
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
minute ago whether you expect
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
that that increase to to decrease the
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
increase of transmission costs i think
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
you said you do expect that to
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
to uh to be a
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
a slighter slope than it has been in the
 
01:32:29.679 --> 01:32:30.390 align:start position:0%
a slighter slope than it has been in the
past

01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes so
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
if we think back to the time frame when
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
the iso started
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
operating the system we began the
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
planning process for
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
reliability needs around 2000
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and there had been very little
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
transmission investment in new england
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
for decades really and much of the
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
investment had gone toward
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh generation and the nuclear fleet as
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
an example but not much investment in
 
01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.270 align:start position:0%
an example but not much investment in
transmission

01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
and at that time the demand for
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
electricity was growing at
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
one to two percent annually so
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
we were having to plan and
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
build transmission infrastructure to
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
catch up with the growing
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
demand for power and any transmission
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
project we put in
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
into our plan is so that we don't
 
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:24.950 align:start position:0%
into our plan is so that we don't
encounter

01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
violations of our reliability standards
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
as an example as transmission lines get
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
with demand they heat up and they would
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
sag we need to make sure that
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
the wires that we have in the system can
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
handle that demand for electricity
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we meet the
 
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.350 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we meet the
voltage

01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
voltage
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
and stability requirements that are set
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the north american electric
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
reliability corporation so
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
all of that transmission was was
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
designed to make sure
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
we can meet the growing demand for power
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to do that
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
effectively and we know that the demand
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
the growth and demand has has slowed we
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
expect it'll pick up
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
over time and
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
the transmission costs then increased as
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
well so you went from paying for
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
very little new investment to suddenly
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
having to absorb the cost of
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
10 billion dollars of investment that's
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
why you saw the transmission costs
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
become a larger share of your electric
 
01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:32.709 align:start position:0%
become a larger share of your electric
bill

01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'll make an analogy it's my own so as i
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
think about it if
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
if when you graduate from college and
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're fortunate enough that your aunt
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
gives you a hand-me-down vehicle
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
and you're able to drive that around for
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of years
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
your costs for operating that vehicle
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
are are minimal but at some point
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
you decide okay i need a vehicle that
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
will carry me forward for the next
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
couple of years reliably
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
then you purchase a vehicle and then you
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a car payment
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of like what happened in
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
the early 2000 time frame
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
the region had not been paying very much
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
for transmission
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
suddenly we needed to make this
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
investment and that became a larger
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.390 align:start position:0%
investment and that became a larger
share

01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the the cost for your electric bill
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we we have always made sure that if
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
we saw needs on the system
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh go away we could scale back or even
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
cancel transmission projects and we
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
certainly have done that so
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's not an automatic that a
 
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
it's not an automatic that a
transmission

01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
project that starts in the study phase
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
will always be built
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to reassess what the
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
needs are and
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
modify our plan accordingly uh follow-up
 
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:45.850 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm glad you mentioned the issue of
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
the possible canceling of transmission
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
since i'm a physicist i've always had a
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
lot of focus on
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
how efficiently we use energy but if i
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the the iso's role
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
does not involve how efficiently energy
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
is being used
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's an area that is out of your
 
01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
that's an area that is out of your
responsibility

01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
but i think about the analogy you
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned about your own home for
 
01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
mentioned about your own home for
example

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
that would be if you're managing a
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
furnace but you're not managing
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
the installation of your home that's a
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
secondary issue
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
but as as we know if you insulate that
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
home you might need a smaller furnace
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
and you don't need as much transmission
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
for example so do you believe that maybe
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
iso at some point should set some kind
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
of energy standard
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency standards because that
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
directly impacts your
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
generation and the the transmission
 
01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.830 align:start position:0%
generation and the the transmission
lines

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative could you
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
just clarify do you mean energy
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency standards for
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
consumers and buildings uh well i
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm being a little late about it because
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
how you operate on this but i'm thinking
 
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.590 align:start position:0%
how you operate on this but i'm thinking
that

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
standards that say you know if the
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
energy that is being
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
provided is being inefficiently used
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
wasted in a big way should there not be
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
some standards to say you know we're
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
providing this energy
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
through our transmission lines uh and we
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
expect you to
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
use it efficiently but there are no
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
standards right now for that
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
is is there any kind of role for for iso
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
in that in that area to say in order for
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
us to get transmission costs down in
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
order for us to get generation costs
 
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
order for us to get generation costs
down

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the region uh one of
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
the tools might
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
be to have an energy efficient use of
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
energy standard that's an
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
interesting concept i would say the iso
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
any authority or jurisdiction to impose
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
any type of a standard like that
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
that would be the
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the federal government
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
which sets
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh standards or the the building codes
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh the appliance efficiency standards uh
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know states can set standards but
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
when we're serving demand on the grid
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the iso is only seeing
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
the generation that's coming out of a
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
power plant
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
moving across the wires and getting
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
delivered to the distribution system we
 
01:38:32.159 --> 01:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
delivered to the distribution system we
don't

01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
we don't see what's happening beyond
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
that so i couldn't tell you
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
and my operators couldn't tell you that
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
new england is
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
very efficient or not efficient at all
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
i know that the region spends about a
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
annually through ratepayer programs for
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency so
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
we certainly are more efficient than we
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
have been in the past
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
those are things like weatherization
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
as probably one of the biggest example
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
lighting anytime you
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
shift from one technology to another you
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
can reduce the total
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
lighting load in the region so those
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
would be examples
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
of improvements in efficiency but i
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't see the iso having a role
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
in setting those standards we just don't
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
have the expertise or the visibility on
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
that side of the system
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes uh
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh god i got a ton
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
of questions but
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
let me try if i could narrow it down i
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
from what i understand
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh we lose a lot of energy
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
in transmission i have no idea what the
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
percentage is
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
by here it's a lot and
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm guessing it has a lot to do
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
with just the distance that electricity
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
has to
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
travel i think of myself uh if
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
i'm using an extension cord
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
um the further i have to run
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
power to to get to what i want to do
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
the larger the uh gauge of wire i need
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
to run etc otherwise the water
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
the wire heats up and you're just losing
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
energy all over the place
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
but so i guess my question is
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um how much power are we losing are
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
there ways to
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
mitigate that i i know i've i've heard
 
01:40:38.719 --> 01:40:39.189 align:start position:0%
mitigate that i i know i've i've heard
about

01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
microgrids and how would that fit into
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
maybe reducing the lengths of
 
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
maybe reducing the lengths of
transmission

01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
you could just comment on that generally
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a lot to talk about or
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
all at once uh thank you representative
 
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.709 align:start position:0%
all at once uh thank you representative
pimentel

01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
pimentel
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are losses on the system
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
so if you are producing electricity at a
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
power plant
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
in maine for example and that
 
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.950 align:start position:0%
in maine for example and that
electricity

01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
is going to be delivered to a part of
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
the system in
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
connecticut there will be losses over
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
that transmission system
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
those losses are not large that's a
 
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
those losses are not large that's a
relative

01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
relative
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
assessment i think they're typically in
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
the plus or minus two to three percent
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
of the total system and
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
when we plan the system when you have
 
01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
when we plan the system when you have
larger

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
conductors you reduce the amount of
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
losses because there's less resistance
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
current moving through that line and
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's something that we take stock of
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh i i wouldn't say that there's a lot
 
01:41:48.719 --> 01:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh i i wouldn't say that there's a lot
of

01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
energy being wasted in losses in the
 
01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.790 align:start position:0%
energy being wasted in losses in the
region

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
region
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the only way to eliminate losses
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
entirely i suppose
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
would be to produce electricity on site
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
where it's consumed
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
and a microgrid is an example of that
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that that's an economic
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
model for a population of 14 million
 
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.189 align:start position:0%
model for a population of 14 million
people

01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
so that's my initial thought on the on
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i think you had other questions i'm
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to stay on or
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging to know i i had heard that
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
the transmission losses
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
were you know in the you know tens or 20
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
but a couple percent that's not bad so
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information i
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just put my hand up
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
i wasn't expecting to be next
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
my question is a little more about
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
scale of power on we have to consider
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
and balance a number of different things
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
and we know that the system is complex
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
i know that there's been a
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
decommissioning plan which i really
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't hear much about
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
or know much about but
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
i know that when we closed for example
 
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.070 align:start position:0%
i know that when we closed for example
yankee

01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
yankee
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
just over the border in vermont there
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
was a significant
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
economic impact in the region and
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's also sort of a loss
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
of some clean energy base load so i'm
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how the iso
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
what you have to say about the iso's
 
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.350 align:start position:0%
what you have to say about the iso's
management

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
of um you know our
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
limited clean base load resources that
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
are on the grid
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
and and how that affects the again
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
reliability going forward because i i
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
know with some of those retirements
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
there were reports that came out of the
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
iso that said
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
that you that the that the
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
management of the reliability was
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
becoming less stable and i i i wonder if
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
you could speak to that because i think
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's something we don't talk about very
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
often but i'd like to understand it
 
01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.229 align:start position:0%
often but i'd like to understand it
better

01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you representative
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you think about
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear as a technology at one point i
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
think new england had nine
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
reactors so we had a significant amount
 
01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:29.189 align:start position:0%
reactors so we had a significant amount
of

01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
power coming from nuclear uh the vermont
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
yankee plant was one of the smaller
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
reactors i think it's about it was about
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
600 megawatts
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
and they had a similar the company owned
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
a similar plant
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
in pilgrim that has also retired and
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
so we have seen a loss of some of the
 
01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.990 align:start position:0%
so we have seen a loss of some of the
diversity

01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
of supply but the iso doesn't have
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
a reliability standard for
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
fuel mix or technology types so
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to retain
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
a power plant like the vermont yankee
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
we could look at delaying the retirement
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the project of the plant
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
until we could reinforce the
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
transmission system
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
and we've done that with some large
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
power stations we did that as i
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the mystic
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
station with the i think brayton point
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
and pilgrim
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
may have had some upgrades that were
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
needed but we
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to keep a
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
plant so if a company says we're going
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
to shut this plant down we can try to
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh prolong that for a very short period
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
and they can say no and they can shut
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
down the plan
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that does present some challenges
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
been in discussions with the states
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
about you know what's the future
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
of uh the the resource mix then we
 
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.149 align:start position:0%
of uh the the resource mix then we
expect

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
over time it will be some nuclear will
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
remain on the system you obviously you
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
folks have one of the
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
one of the plants in new hampshire
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
millstone is the other one
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have natural gas fire generation
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have a growing amount
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy it will probably be
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
more of a challenge
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
for the states in terms of their clean
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
energy goals
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
as well and again that's not something
 
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:30.709 align:start position:0%
as well and again that's not something
that

01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
falls under the isos jurisdiction it's
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
really the states that have decided they
 
01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
really the states that have decided they
want

01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
a certain portion of their resource mix
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
to come from
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
clean or renewable sources of energy
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
but anytime a plant wants to connect to
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
the grid we study it anytime they want
 
01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
the grid we study it anytime they want
to

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
retire from the grid we study that too
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
but there are limits to our
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
the tools that we have in our toolbox if
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
a large power station wants to go away
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative oxen for
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think my question was answered thank
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair i got
 
01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.109 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair i got
two

01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions actually one is the increase
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
in transmission
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh the 10 billion you mentioned over the
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
last uh 10 years
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that just dead weight costs or is
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
there offsetting
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
can't commit and benefit such as
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
congestion charges and costs of lost
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
power that is avoided
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett that's a great
 
01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:37.750 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett that's a great
question

01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have seen significant uh reductions
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
in other costs as a result of the
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
upgrades we've done for reliability
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
and when i say we it's really the the
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
transmission companies have
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
built those projects there was uh
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
significant congestion
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the system the ability to move the
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
the cheapest price
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
power around the network and as we've
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
reinforced the transmission system we've
 
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.709 align:start position:0%
reinforced the transmission system we've
seen

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
more more ability for the lowest price
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
resources to move around the grid so
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's clearly a benefit
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
we also had hundreds of millions of
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
reliability agreements for individual
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
power plants
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
and as we develop the transmission
 
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.950 align:start position:0%
and as we develop the transmission
system

01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh particularly in uh in southwest
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
connecticut as an example we saw those
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh reliability agreements uh expire
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
so there certainly have been benefits
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
that have gone along with that
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
i do have some data on that and i would
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to submit that to the committee
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up thank you the other one
 
01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up thank you the other one
uh

01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
isn't it true because we have a market
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
where we didn't used to have a market
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh then i i still really came about
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
about the time the formation of the
 
01:48:52.719 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
about the time the formation of the
market

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you have less that you have to
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
build more transmission under a market
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
condition than you would under the old
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
system of utilities built in generation
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
because they could build it where they
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer to that i i would
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
be speculating so
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to compare one model to
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't feel like i have it
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
i will avert that that's the case that
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
rather than building a replacement stay
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh a great point uh you had to
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
try you had to reinforce transmission
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
same thing with uh mystic
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have to build transmission rather
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
than build another plant there
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
because you don't know another plant
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
will be built
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay if in in that example
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
transmission is the tool that we have
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure a reliable system if a
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
resource retires
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
it is true that in a vertically
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
integrated system
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
the planners might decide that they want
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
to invest in
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
a new power plant at that site instead
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
of building transmission
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the ability to plan
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
generation the way we do
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
the transmission system thank you
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative pled i remind you we're
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
here to ask questions not debate
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative bernard is recognized
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
johnson um
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
i was delighted to hear your your
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
losses from wheeling is around two
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
percent going from maine to connecticut
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
on high
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
transmission lines like the like the
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
transmission system of iso
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
has do are you aware
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
does that same loss uh
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh amount apply to when we step down to
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
side of the list uh
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
so uh we're we're now looking at power
 
01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.910 align:start position:0%
so uh we're we're now looking at power
losses

01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
losses
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
in in in the distribution grid
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
is it still at that low amount or
 
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
is it still at that low amount or
because

01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
because of the smaller wires uh
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
we we're seeing increased distribution
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
losses and and the reason i asked this
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
question is because
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and this committee has has
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
discussed the concept
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
of you know uh transportation
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
moving to electrified vehicles and now
 
01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.070 align:start position:0%
moving to electrified vehicles and now
we're

01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
now we're uh positioning ourselves to
 
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.350 align:start position:0%
now we're uh positioning ourselves to
say

01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
oh well you know that that is going to
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
be a net
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
cost saving and that benefit to the to
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh i am not sure that if we have
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
some significant distribution
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
losses that we gain that that benefit
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
um so i but i don't know if that's
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
within your wheelhouse to answer that
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
question either
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not an engineer and
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to speculate i think the
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
best uh
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
source of information would be uh one of
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
the distribution companies
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh psnh for example they can tell you
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
what the losses would be
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
between the point we drop power off at
 
01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.109 align:start position:0%
between the point we drop power off at
the

01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
distribution system and where they
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
deliver it to the end use customer
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
we just don't have visibility on that
 
01:52:30.639 --> 01:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
we just don't have visibility on that
system

01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative brezhnev is
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my question
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that transportation is
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
expected to become the largest share of
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
electric demand
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
increase over the next decade if
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which is a much larger
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
state with 77
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
000 miles of road compared to new
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire which only has 16 000 miles of
 
01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire which only has 16 000 miles of
road

01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
would you project that as everyone moves
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
to electrified transportation
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
that electric demand in massachusetts
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
would accelerate much faster than in new
 
01:53:03.679 --> 01:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
would accelerate much faster than in new
hampshire

01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore their percentage of the
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
load would would go up faster than
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
the hampshire's percentage of the loan
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
it it you're asking me to to speculate
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
on something
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
um we don't know how quickly
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the states are going to deploy
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles over time we're
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
starting to forecast that
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis we're in the second
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
year of developing that forecast but the
 
01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.830 align:start position:0%
year of developing that forecast but the
numbers

01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
um are based on limited data
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
i mean if you if you ask any people in a
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
group how many
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
drive an electric vehicle you get a
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
couple hands going up
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the question is how many people will
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
be driving electric vehicle in 5 years
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
10 years 15 years
 
01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.870 align:start position:0%
10 years 15 years
[Music]

01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
we hope to have better information about
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
that over time
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
our information is somewhat limited
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
i guess so my question isn't so much how
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
quickly this would happen it's more of
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
the relationship between assuming that
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and massachusetts
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
adopt electrify their transportation at
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
around the same rate would would
 
01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.550 align:start position:0%
around the same rate would would
massachusetts

01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
because they're a much larger state
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
their demand for electricity
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
would go up much faster than new
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire do you see
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
do you project that sort of relationship
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
we don't make a projection of that
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
relationship but
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
if if i consider your hypothetical i
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
think the answer is yes
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that assumes that the demand
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
for satisfying the demand for electric
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles is coming from the grid itself
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
we also don't know if customers are
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
using on-site
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh solar or if they're using a battery
 
01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:01.189 align:start position:0%
uh solar or if they're using a battery
to

01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
bank energy during the day from the grid
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
um and discharge it in the morning when
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
they go to work so there are other
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
variables in that equation but it is
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
possible if they do a
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
rapid deployment of electric vehicles
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
they would see
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
more demand on the grid than new
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire assuming that you don't
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr johnson okay the chair
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative christian for
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um it's actually i
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
guess two
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
points or items i guess related to that
 
01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
points or items i guess related to that
um

01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention i saw in the
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
new york times they had a really
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
interesting infographic about the pace
 
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
interesting infographic about the pace
of

01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
um electrified vehicle adoption and
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
how long it'll take existing vehicles to
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
to get off the road that
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
i thought people might be interested in
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
question um mileage of road
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
as the best proxy for miles driven
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
or transportation energy use i think
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
um it's probably more dependent on
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
number of cars
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
and miles driven than just the miles of
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
road that are available
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if those numbers are
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
comparable but i just
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
suggest um mr brushney that you might
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
want to look at that
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
um as well or instead
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
is there a question there no
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative thomas you still have
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh mr johnson um let's get back to
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
transmission for a second uh first of
 
01:56:47.119 --> 01:56:47.430 align:start position:0%
transmission for a second uh first of
all

01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to make a comment uh
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
or not too surprisingly uh on your iso
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
new england
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
app its demand and real-time wholesale
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
energy prices
 
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
have been zero throughout new england
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
for the last half an hour
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
at at least interesting statistic there
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
my my question goes back to transmission
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be cl to clarify
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
the transmission costs that show up on
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
our electric bills provided by our
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
electric utility company those costs
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
are totally dictated
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
by iceland new england in terms of what
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
their share is to charge the customers
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
or does the electric utility
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
have any um additional input into what
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh what the cost of the transmission is
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah the iso does not dictate that uh
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the rate that's charged the regional
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
network service rate that's charged
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
is developed by the transmission owners
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
the transmission companies across new
 
01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.589 align:start position:0%
the transmission companies across new
england

01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
they bring that to ferc ferc approves it
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
and then those costs are
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
essentially passed through to
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
end-use customers and there's a role for
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
the states
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
in authorizing those charges on the
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
end use customers bill
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
at that point i don't think the states
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
have any specific control over that it's
 
01:58:28.639 --> 01:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
have any specific control over that it's
just

01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
authorizing it to go on the electric
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill but the iso does not dictate
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh the cost we simply show what the
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh the regional network load is for each
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
the transmission companies and that's as
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that gets rolled up into
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
into the states so this is more of a
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
decision that's between the transmission
 
01:58:54.719 --> 01:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
decision that's between the transmission
companies

01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
and the proceeding at ferc than the iso
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
we certainly have a role in identifying
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
the transmission that's
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
needed and we do that through our
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
planning process
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
we seek to develop transmission that's
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
cost effective but when it comes to the
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
the billing and determining the cost
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
allocation that's
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
not specifically an iso role
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up mr chair hello
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm trying to get to the bottom
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
of a lot of people when they talk about
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that our transmission costs are
 
01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.629 align:start position:0%
the fact that our transmission costs are
up

01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh you're as you can imagine there
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
are a lot of fingers pointing
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
both ways when they they talk about this
 
01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.709 align:start position:0%
both ways when they they talk about this
so

01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
is it my based on what you said so
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
when the local electric company goes for
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
it to get its
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
rate approved uh they have it done
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
through our
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh puc here in the state which but you
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned ferc
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
now i guess uh
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
are you telling me that it's it's all
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
rolled up in the cost of doing business
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
but ferc has to approve
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
certain costs that the electric utility
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
can bring before the puc
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
as part of their rate adjustment um
 
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
and plus i'm sure they would be uh added
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
in there they're
 
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're you know regulated um you know
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
profit margin as well
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a handle on just
 
02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a handle on just
who

02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
decides and what input
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
there is on the actual cost of
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
transmission is
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
who determines that who i mean
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
what are all the factories i mean we're
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
being told one side is responsible
 
02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.070 align:start position:0%
being told one side is responsible
because

02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're perhaps not managing efficiently
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
or the other side is saying that
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
no it's not us it's what we're being
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
told to charge
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
by other entities i'm trying to get my
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
finger on
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
how transmission costs are actually
 
02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.350 align:start position:0%
how transmission costs are actually
established

02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay so if we it's a good question if
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
you back up a little bit
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
and you take uh the bulk transmission
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
system that's
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
in service or planned or under
 
02:01:07.119 --> 02:01:09.189 align:start position:0%
in service or planned or under
construction

02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's a cost for that that's
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
essentially financed over time
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat like a mortgage you don't buy a
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
house for cash
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
you pay for it over time so the
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
transmission system
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
is built and financed over time
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
the cost for recovering
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
that investment is done through a rate
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
that the transmission companies bring to
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
ferc because we're talking about
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
transmission that's engaged in
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh interstate commerce effectively and
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a lawyer so i'm speaking
 
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a lawyer so i'm speaking
generally

02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
so ferc approves uh that rate
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then the the cost of that
 
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.750 align:start position:0%
and then the the cost of that
transmission

02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
are brought to the public utility
 
02:01:52.239 --> 02:01:52.870 align:start position:0%
are brought to the public utility
commissions

02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
essentially and they say we have the uh
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
ferc approval for this component of the
 
02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:00.390 align:start position:0%
ferc approval for this component of the
transmission

02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
of the customer's bill and then that
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
gets added into the
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
retail customers bill so the states are
 
02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.229 align:start position:0%
retail customers bill so the states are
not

02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
directly approving the transmission cost
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a pass through based on
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
something that was approved at ferc
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
and the the folks that the public
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
utility commission
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh would be the best ones to explain how
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
that comes through in
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
a rate case uh because they see that
 
02:02:26.239 --> 02:02:27.189 align:start position:0%
a rate case uh because they see that
directly

02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
the iso does not see the the retail
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
billing side of it because our customers
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
are not end-use customers our customers
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
so we we might have to talk offline and
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
look at some numbers to unpack those
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
questions a little bit more
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
but there are essentially ferc approvals
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
for some components of the bill
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
and state puc approvals for other
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
components of the bill
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you it clarifies it somewhat
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
for me thank
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay you you representative partial is
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for taking my
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
question for uh inviting our guests
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
today it's very informative
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
um i've been looking a little bit trying
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
to wrap my mind around the idea of this
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
rejected energy
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
seems to play a percentage in all of our
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and in new hampshire
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and a subject that came up earlier in
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
our discussions
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
earlier this session was the idea of
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
battery backup
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that a really an uh
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
technology that we can really apply
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
right now does that be applied anywhere
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
aside from there's that one
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
plant in massachusetts that pumps water
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
up and down
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
is there any other real viable use of
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
that technology at this point that
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're aware of
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative partial
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have batteries that have been
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
existence for a number of years the pump
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
storage that you mentioned
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
but we also have a very sizable amount
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
of battery storage technology that's
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
been proposed
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
and i know this is a an issue that
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham brings up and i i
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
had the numbers i was ready
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
ready for her for ready for her question
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh so write this down representative 3
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
635 megawatts of battery storage
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
battery storage a couple years ago was
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the kind of miscellaneous category
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
when you look in the queue and i
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
remember when i would
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
re report to her that the number was up
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
to 50 megawatts
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
and uh she was very excited so now we're
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
at over 3000 so
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
those projects are being put forward by
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
developers who see an opportunity
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
to charge those batteries at one point
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the day and discharge those batteries
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
at another point in the day they might
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
be doing that based on what's happening
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
with price
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
we would call that arbitrage within the
 
02:05:06.719 --> 02:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
we would call that arbitrage within the
market

02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
they may be doing that because they're
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
paired with a renewable resource
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe you have more energy than the
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
grid needs
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
coming from renewable so you you charge
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
the battery with
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
wind power or solar power
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
um but we are we are seeing significant
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
quantities of battery storage start to
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
show up
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
like you want to follow up
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again um and if we can
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
increase our
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
battery storage capacity then we would
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
be decreasing the amount of rejected
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
energy that we have
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
and we would be providing both more
 
02:05:48.239 --> 02:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
and we would be providing both more
stability

02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
stability
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
and uh smaller carbon footprint at the
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
if you're using a battery a battery
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
itself is
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
not um
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
emitting electricity or
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's not emitting any uh environmental
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh characteristics it depends on what
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's being charged with so if it's just
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
being charged from the grid
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
then when it's discharged the output of
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
that battery is really
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
whatever was operating on the grid at
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
the time it's a mix
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
if if it's not connected to the grid but
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's connected on the customer side of
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
the meter
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
then it would be charging with the solar
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
array that might be on the rooftop
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
or if it's a wind project it would be
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
charged with the
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
the wind and then the battery would be
 
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
the wind and then the battery would be
discharging

02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
discharging
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy because that was its
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
source so i think you always have to
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
look at how is the battery configured
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
on the system is it tied directly to a
 
02:06:52.079 --> 02:06:53.109 align:start position:0%
on the system is it tied directly to a
customer

02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
or is it tied directly to the grid and
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
may ask one more follow-up question i do
 
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
may ask one more follow-up question i do
apologize

02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
one more go ahead yes um
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
but if we are we maybe i do not
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand the concept of reject
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
of rejected electric uh rejected
 
02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.510 align:start position:0%
of rejected electric uh rejected
production

02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
production
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
if we have an excess at certain points
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not able to accommodate on
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
our grid
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
um but if we're able to capture that
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't that uh um
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
provide more at least more stability i
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand the batteries are
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
not they're not neutral they're not
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
green they're not carbon
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
i understand that part of the concept
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking about the amount of
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
electricity they're producing
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
that is rejected and i guess i don't
 
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
understand that concept maybe you could
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
um the the concept of rejected
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify what you mean
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a term that we
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
we refer to with a grid okay i was
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a document john mann in
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
particular maybe he can
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
step in if he understands this my
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand is there's overproduction at
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
certain times of the
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
cycle and that overproduction uh
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
cause would be this is invest
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
goes nowhere basically
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
so actually that doesn't happen we don't
 
02:08:25.599 --> 02:08:26.310 align:start position:0%
so actually that doesn't happen we don't
have

02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
over production on the system uh if we
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
did we would have a problem in our
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
control center because they need to make
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the supply and demand
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
are in balance constantly if there's an
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
over production of power the
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
what happens is we start exporting power
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
to our neighbors that they're not
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
expecting and they're going to call us
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
and say new england what's going on why
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
are you sending us more power than you
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
have scheduled so we never
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
run more generation than we need
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's possible you may this may be
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
let's say a wind farm for example we
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
ramp them up and down the way we would
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
have other resources but
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
there may be times when there's more
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
wind production capability than the grid
 
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.149 align:start position:0%
wind production capability than the grid
demands

02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
demands
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we would have to curtail those
 
02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.189 align:start position:0%
and we would have to curtail those
resources

02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
so that might be what they rejected the
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
concept of rejected energy is
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
but okay pretty absolutely thank you for
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
your answer i appreciate your time
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh let's see
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative mann has recognized my
 
02:09:37.599 --> 02:09:38.229 align:start position:0%
representative mann has recognized my
question

02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you mr chairman i just
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
my my thought about the rejected energy
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
it was that it was uh
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
energy that could not be turned into
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
useful purposes for example uh
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh heat energy in a in a in a locomotive
 
02:09:55.679 --> 02:09:57.189 align:start position:0%
uh heat energy in a in a in a locomotive
or

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
friction things like that i'm i'm pretty
 
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
friction things like that i'm i'm pretty
sure

02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was the um the point of the
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
graph i've always assumed that let's put
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
these are um i can't remember the name
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
federal um okay that
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
um this is those grass but they're uh
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of interesting sorry
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
so live or more maybe mr mr chairman
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
just a brief
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up if if i may on that
 
02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:37.589 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up if if i may on that
question

02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead um if you think about the
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
generation technologies we have a couple
 
02:10:44.079 --> 02:10:44.629 align:start position:0%
generation technologies we have a couple
of

02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
examples of gas turbines one is the
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
the simple cycle turbine where you put
 
02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:51.589 align:start position:0%
the simple cycle turbine where you put
fuel

02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
into the the system
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
much like a jet engine but we've also
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
developed a significant amount of
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
combined cycle
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
resources and so rather than simply
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
ejecting the waste
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
in the form of heat they capture
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
that heat and return it to the system
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of that power plant
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
goes up significantly
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
so what we've seen in new england is
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
generation technologies have
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
moved toward more efficient use of that
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
heat that's on the grid system and then
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
i know within
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
many municipal systems they use heat
 
02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.629 align:start position:0%
many municipal systems they use heat
waste

02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
waste
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
for um steam loops and
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh other other purposes that are
 
02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mann for
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
clarifying what the concept
 
02:11:48.079 --> 02:11:51.189 align:start position:0%
clarifying what the concept
was

02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative samsuche is recognized
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:11:57.920 --> 02:11:58.629 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you mr
johnson

02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
johnson
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh a little while back you were talking
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
about like future projections
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh that isil is seeing and
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
i want to get back to that in the
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
context of your responsibilities for
 
02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:12.069 align:start position:0%
context of your responsibilities for
transmission

02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
um number one right now i see
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
currently very imminently one of the
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
issues i'm sure you're you're working on
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
right now is
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
internet security and resiliency of the
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
grid because that's becoming more and
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
more important everywhere and that's
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
immediately needed now but in the medium
 
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
immediately needed now but in the medium
term

02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
like was mentioned before about
 
02:12:35.119 --> 02:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
like was mentioned before about
transportation

02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just about electric vehicles
 
02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
it's not just about electric vehicles
but

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
basically a lot of vehicles in the
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
hybrid so they're using some electricity
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
as well as some gas but we're moving
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
more and more to
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
all electric vehicles so that
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
potentially will be a bigger demand in
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
and then further into the future you're
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
huge amounts possibly of generation of
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
offshore winds into the grid so
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
are those areas all being considered at
 
02:13:08.159 --> 02:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
are those areas all being considered at
i

02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
i think i think the short answer is yes
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of the grid security
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
and cyber security that's something we
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
take very seriously
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the north
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
american electric reliability
 
02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.069 align:start position:0%
american electric reliability
corporation

02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
nerc and every two years we run a major
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
exercise called grid x
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a simulation of physical and
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
cyber attacks
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
on the power grid in north america
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a way for us in a controlled
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
environment separate from the actual
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
grid to test our processes
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
and procedures and our ability to
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
operate the system when it's
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
under attack so there's
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
continuous learning from those types of
 
02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
continuous learning from those types of
exercises

02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
exercises
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
for those who have been down to visit
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the iso you know that you have to
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
get security clearance in advance to
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
come through the gate
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's a physical perimeter security
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
with a guard
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
we essentially have that same perimeter
 
02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.149 align:start position:0%
we essentially have that same perimeter
around

02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
the network that's operating the system
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
so iso new england may have a corporate
 
02:14:20.239 --> 02:14:21.189 align:start position:0%
so iso new england may have a corporate
website

02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the control center that's actually
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
operating the grid so
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to assure you that the the
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
grid itself is not hosted on the
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
internet it's a completely
 
02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
separate uh network with significant
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
cyber security controls around it
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
and we know that the cyber threats are
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
continuing to evolve so we need to
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
continually talk to our colleagues we
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
need we talk with the fbi
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
homeland security to make sure we
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
understand what are the emerging
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
threats and how can we take actions to
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
stop those attacks from penetrating our
 
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.390 align:start position:0%
stop those attacks from penetrating our
system

02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
and mitigating the consequences so we
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
the other question was about offshore
 
02:15:08.079 --> 02:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
the other question was about offshore
wind

02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
wind
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
and offshore wind used to be kind of a
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
smaller slice
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
of what's in the isoq it's now the
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
dominant resource
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
so we have over 15 000 megawatts of wind
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's proposed in new england much of
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
southern new england the massachusetts
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
area there's uh offshore leases that
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
have been designated for
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh development of offshore wind and so
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
we work with
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
all of the developers to interconnect
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
those projects on shore
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
and then we're also working with the new
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
england states who are looking much
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
longer term at the 2050 time frame to
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
understand what kind of transmission
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
would you need to interconnect uh large
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
quantities of offshore wind even more
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
than what's being studied
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
today and we're evaluating that
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
currently with the new england states
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and be happy to keep the committee
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
apprised of
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
that study effort those are the two
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
concepts i
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
recall from the question if there were
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
others thank you very much mr johnson
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative bernardi
 
02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
johnson uh
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
delighted to hear about uh you know your
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
efforts in cyber security but uh
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
interested in understanding what work
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh iso is doing to
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're talking about
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic pulse
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
and this is something that we've worked
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
very closely with ferc our federal
 
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:49.190 align:start position:0%
very closely with ferc our federal
regulator

02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
regulator
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
and there are working groups that are
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
continually evaluating those risks
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the equipment in the field
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
is not owned by the iso so we don't own
 
02:17:02.709 --> 02:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
any transmission or
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
generation so the assets that could be
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
impacted by an emp or
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
some type of geometric geomagnetic
 
02:17:12.399 --> 02:17:13.349 align:start position:0%
some type of geometric geomagnetic
disturbance

02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
disturbance
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
they're not our assets so we can't
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
harden them directly
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
so we have to work with the owners of
 
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
those assets and the industry
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
to find ways to do that
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
in short of dropping a faraday cage over
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
the entirety of new england there will
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
be risks
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
and there are things that have been done
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
to to harden that network
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
we watch the the solar forecast not just
 
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
we watch the the solar forecast not just
for

02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
solar panels but the what's the activity
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
on the sun
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
and track when there are solar storms so
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
we can anticipate
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
how that might impact the bulk
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
transmission system
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
and this gets into some really
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
interesting uh
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
physics around the the location of the
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
pole on the earth and the further north
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
you go
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the greater the risk is for
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
some of the uh geomagnetic
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
activity and i know that the folks in
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
maine have looked at this
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
very closely so the short answer is we
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
work with
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
our regulators to assess this we work
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
with the industry
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a challenge for us to actually
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
harden the assets
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh is there any uh
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
discussions with the suppliers about
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
having uh the the big transformers that
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
that would be potentially destroyed by
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
an emp
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
and knock out our whole electric system
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
having them have standby is
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i understand that
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
stockpiles of transformers that the
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
utilities companies have
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
access to of course the challenge might
 
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:09.750 align:start position:0%
access to of course the challenge might
be

02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
if the impacts are widespread how do you
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
decide who is
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's really a question for the utility
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
companies that own that equipment they
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure have plans i just would be
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
speculating if i said how they would
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
deal with that in
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or any other new england
 
02:19:30.399 --> 02:19:32.549 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or any other new england
states

02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
oxendine is recognized for a question
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'd very much
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
like to
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank mr johnson for thinking of me and
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
preparing that
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
information on on battery storage um and
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
my second point is that as we look
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward and as
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
iso is planning forward over the next 10
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
and 30 years
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
you know we we have to leave room for
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
innovation battery storage
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
the batteries themselves are changing
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
the the confirmation is changing
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
and um i i think that
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
as we go forward we always have to leave
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
room for the
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the excitement of that r d that's
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
coming online
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
new resources that are coming online and
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
and with each step
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
we we have taken really qualitatively
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um order magnitude changes in terms
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
of efficiency and and and that
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is really the nub that we have been
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
able you know when we moved from wood
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
to fossil fuels there was a tremendous
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency jump
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
and moving away from fossil fuels now to
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
new forms and new technologies
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that new efficiency is going to allow us
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
all these uses of beneficial
 
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
all these uses of beneficial
electrification

02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
electrification
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
and evs that so often we get bogged down
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
and worrying oh
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
where are we going to find that it's
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're coming along in
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know it won't always be perfect it
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
won't always be in sync
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be discontinuities but
 
02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.550 align:start position:0%
they're going to be discontinuities but
um

02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
i i for one am very optimistic about
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
this and
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and just wanted to really reach out
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your your presentation
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
today was
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
representatives mcgee is recognized for
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i echo thank
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
mr johnson for coming and speaking with
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
us today this has been great
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
um i attended the iso new england
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy session in 2019
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it struck me at that meeting um
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we have uh iso is dedicated to a
 
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:40.710 align:start position:0%
that we have uh iso is dedicated to a
specific

02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of our reliability for the grid
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
which makes perfect sense
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
um and other entities are um
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for different aspects as you
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned your interactions with ferc
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
and with
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
suppliers and transmission uh
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
transmission the people who who
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
basically support the transmission
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh fit the physicality of the
 
02:22:01.359 --> 02:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
uh fit the physicality of the
transmission

02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the grid so i i wonder if
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
you could say something about
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether the siloed
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
nature of uh of the work that we do with
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
um actually presents part of the risk
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
that we face because i think it's it's
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
one of those things where
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
we don't do that we don't do that so i
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
just i just wonder
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
how much of a risk are we assuming by
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
um the responsibility for maintaining
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good observation um when you
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
talk about security are you
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
referring to cyber security
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
or simply the the general security of
 
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:50.790 align:start position:0%
or simply the the general security of
having

02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
enough resources to meet the demand for
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
power i just want to make sure i
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh the former yeah um
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
so there is an effort in the region
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
where the iso coordinates with the new
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
england states
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
on cyber security and
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
there is uh discussion among the new
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
england conference of public utilities
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners or neck puck
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
chair uh diane martin and her colleagues
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
at the puc
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
are part of that um in the past
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
we've worked directly with um
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner bob scott who was the
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
cyber security lead and there are other
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
people who are part of that regional
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussion from other
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
states so there is communication between
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the iso
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the state regulators so they
 
02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
and the state regulators so they
understand

02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
us the risks that we see and they
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
us the risks that we see and they
provide

02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
insights that they have from the work
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
that they're doing within their states
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
we coordinate with the national guard
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
the fbi
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
homeland security so it may appear
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
siloed but there's
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
a pretty extensive coordination between
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the isos and
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
our peers in the industry we talked to
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
all the other isos about this
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
asking what kind of risks that they see
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
for the region could they potentially
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
spill over to new england the fbi
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
provides alerts to us if we detect
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
problems we share that with the fbi and
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
they have a network to share that
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
information as well so it's probably not
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
as siloed as you might
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh think but we have to be cautious
 
02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:33.349 align:start position:0%
uh think but we have to be cautious
about

02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
how we share that information externally
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
unwittingly providing a blueprint to
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who might want to
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
do something to attack the grid that
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense yeah thank you
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that good question thank
 
02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:51.910 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that good question thank
you

02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i have another question
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
i know you've talked about this already
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
the anticipated
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill build out um or
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
in relation to representative brushy's
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
build out of electric vehicles
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the increase on the load but can you
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
also talk for a moment about the build
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
solar projects and other such projects
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
and how they'll affect transmission
 
02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
and how they'll affect transmission
costs

02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
that won't be included or reflected in
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
if we think about the the solar that's
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
been built recently here
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can you're allowed
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
to do this on zoom but i'll hold up a
 
02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.110 align:start position:0%
to do this on zoom but i'll hold up a
chart

02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
chart
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
i feel like ross perot right so
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
here's a chart if i get this right this
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
shows the growth in solar
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
in new england the small number in this
 
02:25:49.439 --> 02:25:50.469 align:start position:0%
in new england the small number in this
chart

02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
chart
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
is uh back in the beginning there was 40
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts of solar
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
and in the region we now have a forecast
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
of almost
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
8 000 megawatts of solar and then we can
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
break that down
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
by state and i'll provide this to the
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee so you have the data
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
but massachusetts has a hundred thousand
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
installations of solar as of december
 
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
installations of solar as of december
2020

02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has 10 000 so that gives
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
you a sense of the relative scale
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
they've already installed a lot of solar
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
we have numbers for the other states as
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
well connecticut
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts tend to be the leaders on
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
the development of solar pv
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
so if you think about uh
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
what's happening they would effectively
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
reduce potentially reduce
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
the demand on the electric grid by
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
installing that solar because the
 
02:26:45.359 --> 02:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
installing that solar because the
customers

02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
are using power from the panels rather
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
than from the grid
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that could reduce their share of that
 
02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
so that could reduce their share of that
regional

02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
regional
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
network load as those solar panels
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
come online now the transmission costs
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind are allocated on a monthly
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
basis so the amount of solar production
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
you get
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the darker days of the winter might
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
be different than in the spring
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
summer and fall so you probably would
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
have to look at snapshots
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the year to get a better
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
sense of that but to the extent
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
you are installing solar panels on the
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
customer side of the meter
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
it would be reducing the the demand on
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
the grid and that does have the
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
potential to reduce
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
their share of the transmission costs
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that question in the
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
winter when
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
solar panels are not producing very much
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
electricity would massachusetts share of
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
transmission load go up as opposed to
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the summer time when there is a lot
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
of solar available
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that's possible but i'd have
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at some of the
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
numbers on that before i make a
 
02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:05.190 align:start position:0%
numbers on that before i make a
projection

02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
projection
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
about that i'd have be happy to give
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
that some further thought
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay so just uh one more follow-up
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
if the upgrades that are needed
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
to connect all this solar to the grid
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh run in the hundreds of millions of
 
02:28:26.479 --> 02:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
uh run in the hundreds of millions of
dollars

02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
does that affect transmission costs at
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
all or is that strictly a
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
well there would not be any uh cost to
 
02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.469 align:start position:0%
well there would not be any uh cost to
interconnect

02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
interconnect
 
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
a solar behind the meter that would be
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
allocated to the region
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
those would be a distribution charge
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of each
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
individual state
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
and if you had a large solar project
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
200 megawatts that wanted to connect to
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
if they needed to upgrade the network to
 
02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:01.349 align:start position:0%
if they needed to upgrade the network to
accommodate

02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
the interconnection the developer pays
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
those costs
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't see any place
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
where the cost of interconnecting solar
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be allocated
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so do we have any uh
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none mr johnson i want to thank
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
you heartily on behalf of the full
 
02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee for
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
taking time to be with us today and
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
answering all our questions and
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
helping us understand just how uh costs
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the transmission
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
grid affect the uh the cost on our
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
electoral bill we really appreciate
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
you being here thank you mr chairman i
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
always enjoy the conversation and look
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
forward to meeting with you again
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you very much okay so
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it isn't 7 30 and
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
we have no further formal business to
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
conduct i would ask
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything that they
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss
 
02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:10.790 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss
informally

02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
if not then oh representative oxford
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead can you hear me
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes excellent i just wondered if we
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
might want to
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
put forward a date for another meeting
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
just in case
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of these opportunities should arise
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
for another presentation
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
or something on a retained bill in terms
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
of an expert
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
because we you know we have to get the
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
room allocated and all that
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
well based on um the allocation of
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
rooms and zoom licenses stne is assigned
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
to mondays so we could probably get this
 
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:50.469 align:start position:0%
to mondays so we could probably get this
room

02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
on monday for any one of
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
the next several weeks we can
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
occasionally get it on friday depending
 
02:30:58.479 --> 02:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
occasionally get it on friday depending
on

02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
how other committees schedules are
 
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.150 align:start position:0%
how other committees schedules are
running

02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
running
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i will look into that and see what
 
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
days are available
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
and it'll be at this point
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
problematic for me to try to schedule a
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
a presentation already in hand
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
that would be kind of a waste of
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
resources so it's also hard to set
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
to get someone to make an appointment
 
02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
with you when you can't offer them a
 
02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:28.630 align:start position:0%
with you when you can't offer them a
date

02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
is it understood but um
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's part of the coordination that we
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
have to do to
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
make these presentations happen so we'll
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
and try to get something going if you
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
have any suggestions representative
 
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
octaneum of presentations you'd like to
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
hear if you're be sure to share those
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
with me
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the email and i will see if i can
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
make those
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
make those happen representative callie
 
02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:58.630 align:start position:0%
make those happen representative callie
pitts

02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're still muted
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have and i want to apologize for
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the meeting
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
but do we have anything coming over from
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
the senate yet
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
nothing has been assigned are you aware
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
of anything no nothing has been assigned
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
to us yet
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
not yet so that would be the end of
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
april we're looking at the end of april
 
02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
april we're looking at the end of april
mid-april

02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
mid-april
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
no i anticipate that we will be assigned
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
some bills before then
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
um crossover is officially now
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
april 9th i believe
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
april 9th last session so there will be
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
most of the bills will come over after
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
april 9th but i i've been told that some
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
of them will get here before that but i
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
exact dates so i can't i can't make any
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
concrete plans at this point i was just
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if anything had dribbled over
 
02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
wondering if anything had dribbled over
yet

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'm not sure dribbling is
 
02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:06.090 align:start position:0%
how they'll get here but
 
02:33:06.090 --> 02:33:09.349 align:start position:0%
how they'll get here but
[Laughter]

02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
although it is march madness time the
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
ncaa basketball tournament is ongoing
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
right and we are in and but my concern
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
is school vacation week is coming up and
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's the last week in april
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i wondered how busy we were going to
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
be that last week in april so
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
just uh okay
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
some of us still have little ones around
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that's last week in march not
 
02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:37.830 align:start position:0%
i believe that's last week in march not
april

02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%

02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
