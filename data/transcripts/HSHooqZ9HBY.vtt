thank you particularly questions thank
 
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.190 align:start position:0%
thank you particularly questions thank
you

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i could not understand the
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
question are there any inhabitants
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
on the island as you know not that i'm
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a rather small island yeah
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
but i'm not certain of that i think
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
senator forrester would probably be able
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
to address that more accurately
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lasales
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i'm
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
why would you go to the trouble of doing
 
00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
why would you go to the trouble of doing
this

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's required by statute for the
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
transfer of the property
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
but why are you transferring the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
property it's the request of the
 
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
property it's the request of the
community

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
the community is plural i should say
 
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
the community is plural i should say
yeah

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
follow up i'm just wondering
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
why would i mean if it's an uninhabited
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
island uh why
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
would anyone want to transfer from one
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
town to another
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would submit that the towns have
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
probably got good reason for wanting to
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
do it collaboratively
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
and i would suspect that those who may
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
testify after me offer a good reason for
 
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
testify after me offer a good reason for
that

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
my job is to support the communities i
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
represent and that is the reason i am
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um do you have a map to share with
 
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
yeah um do you have a map to share with
us

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
showing this island um is that in
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
did somebody send us grand testimony or
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
something with that
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
so i can see it visually i do not have a
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
map but i'm sure it's readily available
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
on the internet as well as perhaps in
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
possible subsequent testimony
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay thanks jury could you uh
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative majipudi
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning thank you for
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh does this change any responsibility
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance or services
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
i know there's no inhabitants but is
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
there any maintenance required for this
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
island that the transfer would happen
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative i think those questions
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
are best addressed to the folks who are
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
the town of tilton there is no access
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
from the town of san bernaton
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a bridge that goes over from
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
route 3
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
over the river and onto that island to
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
give access
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
that bridge is maintained by the town of
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
chilton um
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
but the island is coming into some
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
disrepair being that
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
um on the headwaters side of the island
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
the river as it runs by is
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
is eroding some of the islands some
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
repair work needs to be done to it
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes a conflict between
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
the two towns who owns the repair work
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
and splitting of the repair work
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
the towns worked together and came up
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
with a solution and that is be
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
considering the access
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
is mainly from the town of tilton and
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
tilton does a majority of the events on
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
the island
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
that northfield agreed to transfer
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
ownership into the town of tilton
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
however this legislative action is
 
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
however this legislative action is
required

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
there are no no people live on it um i i
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
but i think that answers all the
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
ambiguous questions we had that were
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
coming up around this
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
again this is a cooperative agreement
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's still subject to the voters of
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
tilton the northfield
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
on a ballot question it's why i think
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's being moved ahead really fast so we
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
can get it on the ballot
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh for march um and i'll happy to answer
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to uh
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative hill yes mr chair
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
i'll allow representative hill to talk
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
which i've just done
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
i also see that we do have a map that
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
was forwarded over by email and
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully i just emailed that to
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
so look for that in your email and
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative hill should be all set
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning mr chairman um
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
greg hill
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
i serve the towns of northfield and one
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
third of the city of franklin
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm here to concur with
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
everything that
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative lang and senator gaida
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
we did have this agreement between
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
tilton and northfield
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
i recall a few years ago in town meeting
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
taking taking a vote and i think
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
subsequently we found out that the
 
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.790 align:start position:0%
subsequently we found out that the
correct

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
procedure is to go through the
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislature to change
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
town boundaries as i recall the vote was
 
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.189 align:start position:0%
town boundaries as i recall the vote was
unanimous

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
in northfield's town hall a few years
 
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.949 align:start position:0%
in northfield's town hall a few years
ago

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
to make this change northfield is not
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
claiming any kind of uh desire to hang
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
on to the property
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
um this is it it makes all the sense in
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
the world for
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
tilton to remain uh the sole owner of
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
this or to become the sole owner of this
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
um as representative lang said that uh
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the only connection to the island is
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
is from children
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
um so it it makes more sense to do this
 
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
um so it it makes more sense to do this
than

00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
than anything else and i'm also happy to
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any questions for
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative matthew putin thank
 
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.710 align:start position:0%
yes representative matthew putin thank
you

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question is
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
this the first time this has been
 
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
this the first time this has been
attempted

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
attempted
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
or is this subsequent
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
attempt uh thank you for your question
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
um as far as i know
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
at least in the last 40 years that i've
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
lived there
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is the first time it's been
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
attempted um
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
we actually were under the impression
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
that uh all we needed to do
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
was um was make a cooperative agreement
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
between the towns but uh i think when it
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
when it got to the lawyer stage and and
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
changing of boundaries that's when it um
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
escalated to the to the having a
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
legislative action take place um
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
it really is uh nothing but a um
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
if you would see the property you would
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
see that this makes
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
a great deal of sense it is uh it is
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
by all intents and purposes uh a tilton
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
piece of property
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
but no we have never attempted this
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
before we work very cooperatively
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
with tilton and a number of things we
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
share a fire department
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
we share a cooperative school district
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very odd relationship because um
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
tilton is in a different county than uh
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
than northfield um we cross a river
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes that river is very deep
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
and wide and sometimes it
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
barely uh exists but um
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a an interesting piece
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh for for the history books but it has
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
not been attempted in the past as far as
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair a quick
 
00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:28.789 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair a quick
follow-up

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please it's between the two
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
counties not only it's two towns but
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
two different counties correct correct
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that would complicate a little
 
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.830 align:start position:0%
okay so that would complicate a little
more

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it um thank you for your
 
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it um thank you for your
question

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
um i think that's one of those for the
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
lawyers to figure out
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
um it as far as we're concerned uh
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing that changes is the uh is
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
the shape of the town
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
and and that boundary um i
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
i know coming to speak after me is
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
are some of the officials at least one
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the town officials from northfield
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh steffi stephanie giovannucci
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
i do not know if anyone from tilton is
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
is available to answer that call perhaps
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
the honorable
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
part of the town administration who sent
 
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
part of the town administration who sent
that

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
my question regards um finances
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that the island needs
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
some repair
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if um an admission
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
fee or a use fee is charged to someone
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
who might have a wedding in the gazebo
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for your question i um
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
that those finances uh have been
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
um handled uh as far as i'm aware
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
although uh stephanie would be able to
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
answer it uh
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
better um but as far as i'm aware there
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
is a charge for
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
weddings the the concert series that
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
um um i i think that is
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
handled a little differently um and i
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
believe that's done through tilton i'm
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain of that but i'm sure i'm sure
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
stephanie could answer your
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
question much better than i thank you
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm clicking on mu oh can you hear me
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
now there you go we can hear you there
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you everybody um
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to answer a couple of your
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh you asked about
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to rent the island what we have
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
is that you pay to rent the island but
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
you get that back
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
if everything is cleaned up and there
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
are no damages
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
to the island or to the gazebo
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
um so we you know we don't keep that
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
money it is
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is a town park also
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
we don't we have the concerts
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
but like um representative hill stated
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
the axis is from the tilton side
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the island in half of the bridge is
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually in the town of northfield
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
which means that our police force is
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
responsible to
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
to cover the island and
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for us and
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for tilton we decided
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for tilton we decided
that

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
the island would be best if it was all
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
in tilton
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
since the axis is from the tilton side
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
also the deed
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
when the island was given to us
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
states that it belongs to both tilton
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
and northfield
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
and because of that deed the only way
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the in the wording in the deed the
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
only way for us to
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
do this instead of just doing a simple
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
deed a new deed would be to move the
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
boundary lines
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
according to our attorney because
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
if we kept it in the town of northfield
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
but still um just
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
gave the ownership to tilton our police
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
force would still be responsible
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
for policing the island without
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
access from the northfield side
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
it is in two different counties and i
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
believe our
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
attorney is working on moving the county
 
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.149 align:start position:0%
attorney is working on moving the county
line

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
as well i believe he already got a
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
letter from
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
the merrimack county uh and i believe
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
the belknap county
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
that they are fine with it
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
and this has gone before the town
 
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:08.149 align:start position:0%
and this has gone before the town
meeting

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
several times because we thought it was
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
just going to be a quick little
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know here you go here's the island
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
but we found that it was a little bit
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
more complicated than that
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we have to go obviously back to the
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
voters this year
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
and ask for a final approval
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and hash it out for hopefully a
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i answered everybody's
 
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i answered everybody's
questions

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions yes
 
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:45.269 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions yes
representative

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr t thank you miss jim
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
jim yeah i have a neighbor ranuti
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that i was trying to figure that one
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
out um
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
so you made a calm statement about the
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
rent or it's more like a deposit and if
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
everything is cleaned up what if
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's not cleaned up there's damage
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for fixing and who
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
gets that money
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
to which town or county gets the money
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
and how is the north field
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
police reimbursed or compensated
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
for providing the protection as it
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
exists today
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
um as it exists today is that tilton
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
gets the the deposit if there are
 
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.750 align:start position:0%
gets the the deposit if there are
damages

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
damages
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
then we keep the deposit and if it's
 
00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:43.909 align:start position:0%
then we keep the deposit and if it's
above

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
the fifty dollars that we ask for then
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
usually leads the charge in attempting
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
funding from the people who rented it
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
our police force is not
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
compensated for policing the island it
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
is part of our parks
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is a joint park just like they would
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
have to do at any of our other parks
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know monitoring it um so
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're not compensated for um policing
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
the parks it's not a special detail it's
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know they're just there in case of
 
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.230 align:start position:0%
you know they're just there in case of
emergencies

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh we have no other hands
 
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh we have no other hands
raised

the discussion on hb 243
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
so that the sponsor can
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
can move that into and perhaps
 
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
can move that into and perhaps
consolidate

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
hb 243 i was looking for it and suddenly
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with it today i was looking
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
through my notes for it
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
while you talking we're putting it aside
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
for today
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
let's see yeah we're going to recess
 
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
let's see yeah we're going to recess
that

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
that bill to give the sponsor an
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to combine that bill with a
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
couple of other bills so that
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
i believe there's going to be an
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to move
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
two or three bills into one bill to make
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
it more efficient
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you next
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%

that's at 10 o'clock and so uh
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think that we're not going to take up
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
262 earlier
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to see if we we have some time
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
we have 45 minutes until 10 o'clock let
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
me see if we can
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
buzz through some of some of the
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
executive session and some other bills
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's difficult for me
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
to be quiet
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
is is there a cap on
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
what is the upper limit of
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
generation facility renewable generation
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
is it still
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
one megawatt or is there a limit
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i don't
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
think it's and i don't think it's
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
particularly relevant to the
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
issue that we're that we're dealing with
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
with this with this bill
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
um the renewable generating facilities
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
follow the law
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is just has to do with how they're
 
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.349 align:start position:0%
this is just has to do with how they're
assessed

00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
and which tax they pay true
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
i follow mr chair
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
larger but you know they're not
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
supplying to the local but they can
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
have a facility larger like the fritz
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
williams right now
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
has 25 megawatt but i don't know what
 
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.750 align:start position:0%
has 25 megawatt but i don't know what
their

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
what their deal would be to
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
do that a
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%

chairman dolan thank you mr chair

yes i have a question mr chair
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um so it's niggling in the
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
back of my head
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm confused i've only been a
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
legislator for
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know four terms now three terms
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between what we did when
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
we recessed a bill
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
and when we retained a bill i noted that
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't vote on the recess
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was just decided quote unquote and
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
now we've voted to retain a bill
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
which i understand means we're going to
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to work on it possibly along
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor so the difference
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
between the two please
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
yes the it is within the authority of
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
the chair to recess
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
a bill at any time and
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to come up for a vote
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's just uh
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
really we're doing this publicly to let
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
those who may be
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
dialed in to understand what happened
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
and also make sure the committee knows
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh this recessing it just moves it out
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
to give the uh the sponsor or somebody
 
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.270 align:start position:0%
to give the uh the sponsor or somebody
to

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
continue to work the bill and it will
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
come right back to us within a
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
within a couple of meetings where
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
reading will push it out
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
to give us time to work on it over the
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
summer and it will come back to us
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
um hb64 is that going on consent
yes

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right i'll take
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go to another bill on
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is hb 154 which was the
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
revitalization of tax incentives this is
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
the last time this was in the ways and
 
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.109 align:start position:0%
the last time this was in the ways and
means

00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee it passed 20 to zero
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
and uh this seems to have a lot of
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of bipartisan support but it still
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be voted on in our committee
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
so what 154 if you want to take uh
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
30 seconds to pull up your
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
data banks and your brain as to what we
 
00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:54.549 align:start position:0%
data banks and your brain as to what we
heard

00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on uh
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
on february 9th
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
at this point i'll look to
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcbride
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion motion pass mr chairman
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh well we have a motion about to pass
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
that hp 154
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
2 0 2 1 0 3
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
say it again 2 zero
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
two one zero three
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
four four eight that's a different build
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
oh i think so that may be a different
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill that's right
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
would you like to withdraw that motion
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes i would mr
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion and a second on

by representative tree levin and i
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%

clerk uh smith welcome to our committee
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
meeting with what can
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
you recognize
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um so i i
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
received a
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
question from from christina a few
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
minutes ago um
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
regarding um and and apologize i wasn't
 
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:29.589 align:start position:0%
regarding um and and apologize i wasn't
here

00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh to to hear exactly the situation um
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
but uh i believe that there was a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
question about whether or not a bill
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
could be recessed for the year
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh to be taken up next year obviously
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
the only way that would happen
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
is if you all voted to retain
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation uh for action
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
during the year
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then uh that would subsequently come
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the floor
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the second year of the session but
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
that is the only uh
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
way that you could dispose of something
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
additionally i do want to
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
address one other point uh and and this
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
is actually i representative piamonte
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
i left a message for you on your phone a
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
little bit ago um
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
there is a minority report that was
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
filed with a motion of retain
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
retain is not a motion that the house
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually votes on it is a committee
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
motion only
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so if if you are writing a minority
 
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
um so if if you are writing a minority
report

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
and even though you wish to retain
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
something you have to have
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
a dispositive motion that goes to the
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
floor so i need either an itl
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
or an otp or an otpa but retain is not a
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
motion that goes to the floor
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the house clerk the the issue that we
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
had that
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps christina was questioning is
 
00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:41.589 align:start position:0%
perhaps christina was questioning is
that

00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
we made it we recessed a bill
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
for a couple of meetings uh to allow the
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor to do some consolidation
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
but we did retain a bill to take up
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
again next year
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
those were the two actions that we took
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think there was any problem with
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
either of those
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
okay so when when you're saying you're
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
recessing a bill you mean that you
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session on the pub
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
on on that particular no we respect it
 
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:07.349 align:start position:0%
on on that particular no we respect it
we

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing okay i i understand
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's fine as long as as long as it's
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
not an early bill that's due today
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
i would note if you recess the public
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
hearing you do need to schedule it for a
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
time certain
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
um when you take it up again so
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh do try to do try to have uh an idea
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
on that so that we can get that in the
 
00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:31.750 align:start position:0%
on that so that we can get that in the
calendar

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
calendar

be refueled
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.230 align:start position:0%
i learned a long time ago if it's not my
problem

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%

1945.

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
no we uh what was it a second cruise
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh our
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
imports were usually civic day sweet
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
days big day civic day
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
you know civic day hong kong civic day
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
civic day
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
and my second cruise we finally
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
vanilla well that's subway bay
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
right no civic bay is uh
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
around the other side but it's the
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
philippines that's philippines
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
so we pulled in the manila
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
drop the anchor and then
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know usually they take up a couple
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
of links to set the anchor
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
so they they kept pulling it up
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we're sitting there
 
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we're sitting there
going

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
something's wrong well it was uh
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's april 30th 1975
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:20.530 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
and then it really ended in april of 75
 
01:06:30.559 --> 01:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
and then it really ended in april of 75
when

01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
yeah well i i i but
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
i made another slight tweak to it
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
and uh driving up here today i'm
 
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
and uh driving up here today i'm
thinking

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's actually
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
prohibitive right now is
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
changing the subject 44
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
i was thinking that maybe
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
we would change make another slight
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
tweak to uh
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.969 --> 01:08:30.979 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
to say
[Applause]

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
they represent the community
 
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.070 align:start position:0%
they represent the community
representatives

01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you mr chair
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if the
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative that made the
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider um uh was from the
 
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.310 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider um uh was from the
prevailing

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
prevailing
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i said it again yeah motion
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
to reconsider doesn't the person making
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
the motion have to
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
have been in the prevailing side of the
 
01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
have been in the prevailing side of the
vote

01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just questioning if he was thinking
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
about is if we're on the house
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
floor or the hall of representatives
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
then that rule
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh does uh that's playing effective
 
01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
uh does uh that's playing effective
definitely

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions i just want to
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
re-clarify is that
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that the same uh on committee
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
also whatever is the rule for the
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
floor is it a different for
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
reconsideration i haven't experienced
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
anything like this this is my fifth term
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make uh be
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
doubly sure that it's the same
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee to try not to take advantage
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
of my good nature and
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and waiting to be
 
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.229 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and waiting to be
recognized

01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
until we can proceed for our main rules
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question is for
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration or
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
any rules it's a same rule
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of we just had that clerk
 
01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
in terms of we just had that clerk
clarify

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
for retaining on the floor or in the
 
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
for retaining on the floor or in the
committee

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
isn't the same thing to reconsider
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't it have to be from the
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
prevailing side
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh to be reconsidered i just want that
 
01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh to be reconsidered i just want that
clarification

01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
one more time because i
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know i this is my fifth term and
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand what the rules
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
are for
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
county i mean sorry committee meetings
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the floor so what's the difference
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
and why on one you know at the
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the floor it has to be prevailing
 
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.790 align:start position:0%
on the floor it has to be prevailing
side

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee it's not
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
however if the bill is still
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
in committee he decides and requests
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i echo my
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
previous speakers and um i was
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm still confused it was 11 to 7
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
otp amend as amended failed in
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
itl 11 to 7 and to
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
change the will of the committee again
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm just asking if this would be
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
i need to look forward to in terms of
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
for my own sake i believe i voted
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
against this
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
bill the last time but i in the meantime
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
have had uh significant
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
time to think about it and i had
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
a couple of different nights had a dream
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
about wonderful lemonade
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
so i i that's the reason for my change
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
of vote
 
01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:25.990 align:start position:0%
of vote

for lemonade stand a soft drink stamp

um it we we all do at times and and i
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
think on the floor
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
is probably where um we should change
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
our heart rather than
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
to continue to um do this in committee
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why i
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
i am um truly disappointed um
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of the notes that i had i had
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
written um
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
when we discussed this was possible of
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
if it ain't broke why fix it one of the
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
comments that was made was that
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
it never happened in this state and it's
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
been 10 years i think since it
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
it happened in texas so um i guess
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
um i i understand wanting to support the
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
people who brought this
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
forward it's um it's an admirable um
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
attempt and so on but i'm disappointed
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
at what the committee is doing today so
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me welcome
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that i knew this was
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
potentially coming so
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
to educate myself
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
i went to the house clerk and inquired
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what were these rules around
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
me in consideration so i hear about the
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
speed on that
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
and what we are doing is
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is impossibly different
 
01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is impossibly different
with

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know all representatives there are
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
different rules that apply
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
those of you may be a little confused
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
i spoke directly with paul smith about
 
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.030 align:start position:0%
i spoke directly with paul smith about
this

01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
welcome to that similar investigation
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to get your own
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
expectation but
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you the confidence that will
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
be in our
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
process of doing is uh acceptable
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
although it may be disappointing for
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
some of you
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
the process that we are using
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
is further out per health
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you mr chair
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
um i want to echo some of my uh
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
fellow representatives uh just in that
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
um i you know i voted for
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment because it made sense to
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
change lemonade to
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
include all soft drinks we had a lengthy
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
but towns still have the authority to
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
license and regulate all of these things
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
that happen on sidewalks
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and they can make the choice of whether
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
to charge for it or not
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
where to put them they have health
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
officers to look at
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
safety so i find that this is an
 
01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
safety so i find that this is an
unnecessary

01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.110 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
bill

01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gilbert are
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
opinion class thank you mr chairman
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is really a slippery slope bill
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
i mean so you all of a sudden you're not
 
01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:55.350 align:start position:0%
i mean so you all of a sudden you're not
having

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
permits being required for lemonade
 
01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
permits being required for lemonade
stands

01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
stands
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
they start selling their girl scout
 
01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:02.390 align:start position:0%
they start selling their girl scout
cookies

01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
cookies
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
and then they start selling french fries
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
and whatever
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
i just think that it's you know this
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
should be left up to the town
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
what why should we as a state
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
mandate what is going to be done at the
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
local level
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%

01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
this is not worth our time thank you mr

01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative hotel
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
yokela thank you
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
i am here today to introduce
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh hb 262 relative to
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
the adoption of bylaws and ordinances by
 
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.390 align:start position:0%
the adoption of bylaws and ordinances by
municipalities

01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation just seeks to
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
have each bylawn ordinance
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
state the rsa section that enables
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
that municipality to enact the ordinance
 
01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:19.030 align:start position:0%
that municipality to enact the ordinance
or

01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
only new or amended bylaws would be
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
affected so this
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
does not require them to go back to the
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
previous ones but only new ones
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is important
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to know how their
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
empowering rsas are
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
being used at the local level so that it
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
will inform us to
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
adjust or make better laws in the future
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
um residents of those
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities oftentimes
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
are confused as to what um
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
powers are given uh and how
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
they are to be remedied if they don't
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
believe them um municipality has that
 
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
believe them um municipality has that
power

01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
and uh some examples may be
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
the power of you know some some
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
municipality to
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
raise the smoking age or limiting speech
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
particular area of town etc etc
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so they might question how they that
 
01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.430 align:start position:0%
and so they might question how they that
the

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
municipality believed that they were
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
empowered to do so
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
and help them prepare um a legal remedy
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
if that if they believe that that is
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
necessary instead of
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
right now they would have to go to court
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
to even find out where the defense
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
is coming from and and so that
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
if if they know ahead of time they might
 
01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.350 align:start position:0%
if if they know ahead of time they might
um

01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
be let be asking the legislature to
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
change it instead of going to the courts
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
and may reduce uh the possibility of
 
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.510 align:start position:0%
and may reduce uh the possibility of
legislation

01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
that is uh or the the possibility of
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that um really should be
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
addressed by the
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh house and senate and not by
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh our courts clogging up our courts
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
also municipalities should be
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
advised on their
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
law before they issued the regulation so
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
is going to cause additional
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
leg work by the municipalities and i'm
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for consideration of this uh
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions thank
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
you questions
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh i see uh representative for you got a
 
01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
uh i see uh representative for you got a
question

01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair my hand i forgot to put my hand
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
down before okay so
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
let me ask you do we have uh mr cordell
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the hma online to testify
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
we do mr chair and he should be uh
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
he should be good to speak
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
well at least oh there he goes thank you
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um cordell johnson
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire municipal
 
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.189 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire municipal
association

01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
i have uh sent a letter to the committee
 
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:20.870 align:start position:0%
i have uh sent a letter to the committee
expressing

01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
expressing
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal association's opposition
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
and um as i said in the letter
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you know it certainly is a good
 
01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
um you know it certainly is a good
practice

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
for a municipality to
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
a stat the enabling statute when it is
 
01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.189 align:start position:0%
a stat the enabling statute when it is
enacting

01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
enacting
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
a bylaw or or an ordinance but
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
not everything that's a good idea should
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
be mandated
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we are concerned about what the
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
consequences would be
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
as i said in the letter there there's
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
any number of
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
situations that could result in the
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
failure to
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
cite the enabling statute when an
 
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
cite the enabling statute when an
ordinance

01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
is adopted it could be a it could be a
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
simple mistake
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
it could be an accident that occurs at
 
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.310 align:start position:0%
it could be an accident that occurs at
any

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh number of different steps in the
 
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.430 align:start position:0%
uh number of different steps in the
process

01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and if the municipality fails to cite
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the enabling statute
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like for the for the
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
requirement to make any sense there has
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be a remedy and presumably the remedy
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
would be that the ordinance becomes
 
01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:36.390 align:start position:0%
would be that the ordinance becomes
invalid

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
and that would cause serious problems
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
um again you know select men
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
city councillors aldermen are not legal
 
01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
city councillors aldermen are not legal
experts

01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
experts
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
and they do not always
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the exact statute that
 
01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:55.669 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the exact statute that
enables

01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
enables
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they do their best
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
but if they make a mistake that should
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
not result in the
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
invalidation of an entire ordinance i
 
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.629 align:start position:0%
invalidation of an entire ordinance i
mentioned

01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
i mentioned in my letter um one thing
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
that happened when i was a selectman and
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
we were reviewing our investment policy
 
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
which the town is required to have under
 
01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
which the town is required to have under
rsa419

01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
rsa419
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
i looked at the policy and it cited rsa
 
01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
i looked at the policy and it cited rsa
209

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
209
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
i looked up rsa 209 to see what it was
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a statute that regulation
 
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.470 align:start position:0%
and it's a statute that regulation
regulates

01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
regulates
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh hunting of game birds
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
and uh prohibits the taking of homing
 
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
and uh prohibits the taking of homing
pigeons

01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
pigeons
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh obviously had nothing to do with
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
investment policy but
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
um arguably if this bill had been in
 
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
um arguably if this bill had been in
place

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
our investment policy would have been
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
invalid because it cited the wrong
 
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.709 align:start position:0%
invalid because it cited the wrong
statute

01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i just think as i said certainly it's
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
a good practice to cite the statute
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
when you adopt an ordinance but
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
to make it a requirement will cause
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
serious problems
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.070 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions for mr cordell
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
or for representative we'll take it uh
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
folks first representative
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
i think representative manchapudi and
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
khlee were both before me and even if
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
they weren't i i defer
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr cordell
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
um how does this
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
change or does this uh change the whole
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
um rsa in interpretation
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
and shifted to
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm not sure i entirely
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay let me clarify okay
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
um this change you know relative to
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
adoption of
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
bylaws and ordinance by municipalities
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
so this would mean that local
 
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.790 align:start position:0%
so this would mean that local
municipalities

01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
and can change
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
or adopt right so this
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't this create more
 
01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.350 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't this create more
confusion

01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
how many municipalities do we have 283
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh 234 to be exact
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
um and you're yes i i think it would
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
create a lot of confusion
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't it wouldn't
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
affect i mean a municipality's ability
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
to adopt an ordinance but it would
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh it would create problems if they
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
as i said if they make even a minor
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
mistake in
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh in adopting it if they if they forget
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
to cite the statute or if they cite the
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
wrong statute
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think that creates a lot of a lot of
 
01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
i think that creates a lot of a lot of
confusion

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yes please go ahead
 
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yes please go ahead
um

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
so would this create more
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
legal challenges for municipalities
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
or would it reduce the legal challenges
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
i think it would it would create more
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
legal challenges if
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
my town adopts an ordinance
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
that i don't like currently
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
if i want to challenge it i have to find
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
some reason like you know this isn't
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
authorized it's unconstitutional or
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
but under this if if the selectmen
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
simply forget to write
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
down this the uh statutory citation i
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
can say
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
aha you didn't do this the ordinance is
 
01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.669 align:start position:0%
aha you didn't do this the ordinance is
invalid

01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative clee and representative
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
maggiore were ahead of me
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much uh mr chair
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite sure who this question
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
should go to it probably should
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
um go to representative um yokela
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
um the the question that i have is
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
in in in nashua when we create signage
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
um we often we almost always
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
cite the ordinance we also
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh often will cite the rsa
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
if the rsa were to change
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
um which they often do we would have to
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
replace the
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
signage and so on um and and i would
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
recommend that we do that but it can be
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
costly if we don't do it
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
um on a timely manner and i
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
my concern is just that if we have the
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
wrong rsa
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
cited um this could leave us open to
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits is is that an
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule and i and i guess
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
i put that to representative uh
 
01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:32.229 align:start position:0%
i put that to representative uh
yokela

01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
this statute or this uh
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
um change in law does not
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh contemplate the change of a statute
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
um and so if if they
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
enact the rsa that enables it at a
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
specific point
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
um there is no method for going back and
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
saying okay now the rsa has changed
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's enact another statute or another
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
um ordinance or bylaw that amends it
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
that amendment would need to
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh state the new rsa but
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think it would be
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to say that um
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
the the the bylaw and ordinance would
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
automatically become invalid at this
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
at the time of the rsa change i think
 
01:48:31.119 --> 01:48:34.470 align:start position:0%
at the time of the rsa change i think
that

01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
it would be when you're citing rsas it's
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
possible to just
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
to say that it's you know
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
as of blah blah date and you would be
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
able to look up that statute and see
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
um where that power
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
is and if it gets repealed if that power
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
is repealed then obviously it will
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and it will
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
affect the ordinance or by law but if it
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
just moves sections
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think that it will not invalidate the
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
the bylaw but i think that that is um
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
something that could be addressed
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
by an amendment thank you to make it
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
more clear sorry
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:49:19.599 --> 01:49:27.669 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair thank you
representative

01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
once again i i don't mean to be rude mr
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
chair but representative maggiore had
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
his hand up before i did
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll defer to him that's okay i'm
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
calling on you next so
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'll go real quick thank you mr
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
chair and i believe
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
my question will be for cordell but i
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome the input from
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative yokela can a state
 
01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:49.990 align:start position:0%
representative yokela can a state
statute

01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a whole harmless clause in it
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
do i need to so mike my concern cordell
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
is exactly yours i
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm the chair of my select board i
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
take great
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
pride in and pleasure in in reviewing
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
statutes when we're going through
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
something what happens if i make a
 
01:50:16.719 --> 01:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
something what happens if i make a
mistake

01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
can can this statute say you know
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
something to your concern failure to
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
cite the proper statute
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
um shall you know you know a whole
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
harmless clause in case i screw up
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
because i actually have screwed up
 
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:32.950 align:start position:0%
because i actually have screwed up
before

01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
um 12 times in the last 12 minutes
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i i suppose you could you
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
could put in a provision saying that the
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
failure to cite
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
the statute shall not uh
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
shall not cause the ordinance or bylaw
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
invalid or ineffective but
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh if you do that you're saying that it
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any consequence and if it
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any consequence then what's
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
what's the point of uh enacting the
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
requirement in the first place
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you either you can have
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
something with with no consequence or
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
something with bad consequences
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of what our people's hands
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
were up i'm going to go to
 
01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
were up i'm going to go to
representative

01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you very much and i
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
promise not to uh
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
impose on your generosity i think my
 
01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.149 align:start position:0%
impose on your generosity i think my
question

01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
um well once upon a time i was a
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
preschool teacher
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we had this great book that we used
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
with our kids
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
that helped them with fine motor
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
coordination and eye hand and it was
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
called work jobs
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
this bill strikes me as a make work
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
job bill in the sense that
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
those of us who are involved with making
 
01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.629 align:start position:0%
those of us who are involved with making
laws

01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
local officials enforcing laws
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
um legislators in our
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
senate and house and we know how laws
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
are created in our state
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary usury to the to the users
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and and creating um creating work
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
where work doesn't need to be done we
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
know how bylaws and ordinances are
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
affected in towns and we know how they
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
can be created we don't need to add this
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
mandate on top of it
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
sorry that wasn't a question it was a
 
01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:42.830 align:start position:0%
sorry that wasn't a question it was a
statement

01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to tweet it as a question
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
and answer it
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
please you want to reform your statement
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
one more question so what do you think
 
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
one more question so what do you think
cordell

01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
cordell
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate the question and and i
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
i sort of agree i don't entirely agree i
 
01:53:00.239 --> 01:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
i sort of agree i don't entirely agree i
mean

01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
i as i said i do think that the the
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
exercise of of uh
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
citing the statute when you when you
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
enact a bylaw
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
or an ordinance is a good one um
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
if every time the town the selectmen the
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
aldermen whoever adopt an ordinance
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
they would look at each other and say
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
what statute allows us to do this
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
let's figure that out and let's write it
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
down i think that would be a good thing
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
because they do need to understand that
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
you can only
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
adopt an ordinance if it's authorized by
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
state law
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
so i do think it's a good thing to go
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
through that exercise but i
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
but i agree with you that it's a bad
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
thing to mandate it
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
because if if they fail to do it
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
and there's a state statute that says
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
you have to do
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
it then the failure is going to result
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
in someone challenging the ordinance
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you next representative
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh my question is for
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
will this exercise involve
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
someone at a municipality in the
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
administration level
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing every year what rsa has
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
changed and does it affect
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
our policies and does it add to
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's duties
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh i
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to before if it was the will of
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
the committee that their concern was
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
that you know an rsa
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
change would require an amendment to a
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
bylaw and ordinance
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to draft an amendment that
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
states that
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
um the rsa would essentially
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow the the um the bill
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
the bylaw ordinance so that they
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh reenact reenact or amend it every
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
single time an rsa change they would
 
01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:10.870 align:start position:0%
single time an rsa change they would
just

01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
like state the date of the
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously the date of the
 
01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously the date of the
effective

01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
date is already going to be on the bill
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
or the ordinance or the bylaw
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
so so it would only be
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
to say like the rsa and section
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
at the time of uh
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
enactment would be
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
future changes to the rsa would not be
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
relevant to the
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
bylaw ordinance unless the power was
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
completely repealed
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question hey
 
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.790 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question hey
representative

01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
no i apologize i just didn't lower my
 
01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.350 align:start position:0%
no i apologize i just didn't lower my
hand

01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative question
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh i believe representative guthrie had
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
his hand up before me so
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyhow uh thank you for taking my
 
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
anyhow uh thank you for taking my
question

01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh listening to all this i
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
i have this
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the town this is for mr
 
01:56:37.599 --> 01:56:38.709 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the town this is for mr
cordell

01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
cordell
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the town know what
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
is permitted uh
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
by rsas when they write new ordinance
 
01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
by rsas when they write new ordinance
ordinances

01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
if you're asking why why they shouldn't
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
know what is permitted that
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
i think they should know as i said in
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
response to representative truleven
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think it is a very good idea for them
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
to ask themselves every time
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
what what statute enables this
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh what statute authorizes us to do this
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i i think they should i think
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh it is a good idea to cite the statute
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
adopt an ordinance but the making the
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
failure to do so
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
result in the invalidity of the
 
01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.070 align:start position:0%
result in the invalidity of the
ordinance

01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
is just i see it as a formula for
 
01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
is just i see it as a formula for
disaster

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and i guess i make the analogy
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh does the state legislature every time
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
it passes a law
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
does it cite the provision of the new
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution that authorizes
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
it to do so
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
and if it were required to do so and
 
01:57:50.719 --> 01:57:51.669 align:start position:0%
and if it were required to do so and
didn't

01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
um what kind of what kind of mess would
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
that create
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's a pretty good analogy um so
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
if if the state isn't going to require
 
01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
that for the
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
state legislature i don't think it
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
should require it for our cities and
 
01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:14.070 align:start position:0%
should require it for our cities and
towns

01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
 
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
chairman

01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
a question is i think from the sponsored
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty much pretty much your
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
question has been
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
asked maybe three or four times as by
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
other people but
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i always when i look at a bill like this
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
i ask
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
what's driving it what's the reason for
 
01:58:42.239 --> 01:58:43.109 align:start position:0%
what's driving it what's the reason for
it

01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
and i'd suggest to you uh
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
that i ask you do you have any instances
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
where selectmen or town councils or city
 
01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
where selectmen or town councils or city
councils

01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
councils
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh do are behaving in this manner i'd
 
01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.109 align:start position:0%
uh do are behaving in this manner i'd
suggest

01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
from my experience that
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
these kind of boards making these kind
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
of laws
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
do in fact do what you're asking and i
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
think the question is well
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
taken that they should be asking the
 
01:59:13.599 --> 01:59:14.390 align:start position:0%
taken that they should be asking the
question

01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have the authority
 
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
but i'd suggest to you
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
that that's being done and asked
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
if you have any issues instances
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
where this is not the case uh and as
 
01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
um in my introductory testimony i
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
i suggested a couple of
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
um instances where people might be
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
confused as to where
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
the power for the municipality uh
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
came from um one of those was
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
the raising of smoking age by a
 
02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:06.629 align:start position:0%
the raising of smoking age by a
municipality

02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
and another is limiting uh
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
speech in a particular area of town and
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that those
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
are definitely something that the state
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
as as
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's not clear from from the face of it
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
where those
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
those powers came from so thank you for
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
but my question is uh do you have any
 
02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:42.149 align:start position:0%
but my question is uh do you have any
instances

02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
instances
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
of where councils are boards
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
or committees actually don't go through
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
that exercise
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
my experience is if you have a situation
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
where it's not clear that whether or not
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
you have the authority
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
that you do go into the rsas and if
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's necessary
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
you even go to your town council
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
that this implies that the board's
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
councils within the state of new
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire are not
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
paying attention to what the rules and
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
regulations are
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
as far as their relationship between the
 
02:01:23.599 --> 02:01:24.470 align:start position:0%
as far as their relationship between the
state

02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
and the town and i'll be honest with you
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
as a long time selectmen
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh and on many boards i actually resent
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that they
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
the implication is that uh
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
we do not do uh due diligence
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
when we make our laws and uh
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.630 --> 02:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up um
 
02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:56.149 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up um

02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
if you're asking which specific

if you're asking which specific
ordinances

02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
um do not list a rsa currently
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to um find
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
a few examples for you there's going to
 
02:02:09.199 --> 02:02:09.669 align:start position:0%
a few examples for you there's going to
be

02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
a long list if if i tried to find all of
 
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.109 align:start position:0%
a long list if if i tried to find all of
them

02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
but um i definitely agree that
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
some uh or most
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
if not all of the selectmen
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh town councils etc etc
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
um or city councils um
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
are trying to stay within the
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
the bounds of the law and the powers
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
granted to them by the legislature
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
um the the question is whether or not
 
02:02:41.199 --> 02:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
um the the question is whether or not
what

02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
they it is clear to both
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the residents of
 
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:48.709 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the residents of
that

02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that municipality
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
that they did so and
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that um just
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
referencing the rsa that they did look
 
02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.589 align:start position:0%
referencing the rsa that they did look
up

02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
and or did get advised by council that
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
it was enabling them to make this this
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
bylaw or ordinance just notating that in
 
02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
bylaw or ordinance just notating that in
the

02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
an undue burden so thank you for the
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.550 align:start position:0%
an undue burden so thank you for the
question

02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gilman here's a
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes i did i i muted myself and didn't
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
get a
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
chance to ask you to ask you for
 
02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:34.149 align:start position:0%
chance to ask you to ask you for
permission

02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair excuse me
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to follow up my previous
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
question with the representative
 
02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
question with the representative
vioquela

02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
vioquela
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
because i feel it wasn't really answered
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
a town or city a municipality has a
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
policies and and ordinances
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they reference for good practice
 
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.790 align:start position:0%
and they reference for good practice
references

02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
references
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
the particular rsa that um those
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
issues come under when you know i'm
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
looking at a book here of
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
of changes to rsas and repealing rsas
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
when that happens uh you know i
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
understand that a town may
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
or should a good practice review their
 
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:21.109 align:start position:0%
or should a good practice review their
rsas

02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
their policies and and etc
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
annually but i don't find that that
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
happens so my question is
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
whose job is it going to be to look at
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
all the changes in rsas
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
who's going to tell a municipality that
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
these rsas have changed and you must
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
review all of your
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
work to be sure you follow them so
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
i find that this makes work and i want
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
to know who's
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for it who's going to
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i disagree
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
that it will create work if
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment that i referenced
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
in the answer to your first question
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
was enacted if an rsa
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
changed it would not necessarily have
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
any effect on the bylaw or ordinance
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
if an amendment to this
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislation was proposed to that effect
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
and adopted
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
and so it would only um
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
come into play that anyone wouldn't at
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
the town would need to know
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
if the power was completely repealed and
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
therefore they wouldn't be able to have
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
such an ordinance and by law
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
that would be the only reason i
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
am suggesting that they would need to
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
know at the
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
at the town level i'm suggesting that
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
they that i draft an amendment
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
to address your concerns of additional
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
work at the
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
at the local level so thank you for the
 
02:05:52.239 --> 02:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
at the local level so thank you for the
question

02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions in the
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
for presenting this bill um i'm looking
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
for some clarification
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
on a particular point and my question is
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
law and if a municipality fails to cite
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%

02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
it is challenged in the courts and if it
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
does in fact

legally invalidate the um cited
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
ordinance could somebody provide me with
 
02:06:40.079 --> 02:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
ordinance could somebody provide me with
rsa

02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
that provides for that thank you
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i do
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
believe that it would need to be first
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
challenged in court
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and during that process obviously it
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be lengthy
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh this the um selectmen or
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
town or city council would be able to
 
02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:02.470 align:start position:0%
town or city council would be able to
enact

02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
enact
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment during that time frame and
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh reference the rsa in the meantime and
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
address the issue before any
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
action by the courts invalidated as
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance so thank you for
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative i have a question for you
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
you saw this
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill or a very similar bill last year
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
was uh substantially the same content i
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
we had some issues in the committee with
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh slowing down an unfunded
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
mandate given the fact that
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
it was thought to be some considerable
 
02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
it was thought to be some considerable
cost

02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
associated with especially those towns
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
who had
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that give you a visual multiple figuring
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
financial avoidances
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you were thinking in a non-digital
 
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.430 align:start position:0%
uh if you were thinking in a non-digital
mode

02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
mode
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
that would have to go through but i know
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about enabling and going
 
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
we're talking about enabling and going
forward

02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
but still the thought would be that
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
certainly some cost associated with
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
doing that research
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
and publishing that information
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the book avoidance or on the
 
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
in the in the book avoidance or on the
website

02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you uh tackle that
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the question yes i did
 
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:32.950 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the question yes i did
submit

02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
submit
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
substantially similar bill in the pre
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
previous session
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
however it was requiring
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
it would have required going back and
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
amending all the previous
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
um bylaws and ordinances
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
and not just the ones that are
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
being enacted or amended and so
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
um i believe that the ones
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the new bylaws enacted or amended are
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
already having this review
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
done and so it wouldn't
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
create an increased cost and it wouldn't
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
an unfanded mandate in that sense
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
because they're already doing that
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
currently it would just be the
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
additional you know
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
one sentence or something like that on a
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be any work that
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't already being done if i i did
 
02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:31.510 align:start position:0%
wasn't already being done if i i did
agree

02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
last time that going making uh
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
city councils and towns go back and
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
review all of the
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh bylaws and mandates previously
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
enacted that could be seen
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
as a unoffended mandate and so that is
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
why i
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
amended the uh the proposal to this bill
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
as you see before you today thank you
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee for the
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much

when we're done with this i think uh you
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
if we will have accepted all the bills
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
that was still open for that
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
purpose i'm going to look at uh
 
02:10:32.159 --> 02:10:33.589 align:start position:0%
purpose i'm going to look at uh

02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%

um an executive session on cacr4
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of the council it
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make much difference to
 
02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.149 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make much difference to
me

02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
we should do a new one if you'd like to
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
do 284 first that's fine
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
if you have any uh council have a rather
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
committee have a preference
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
is there somebody waiting to testify do
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
we have people waiting to testify
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative majority do we have
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
people waiting to testify at
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%

nhma
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
is the one person listed on our list and
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
he is
 
02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:27.669 align:start position:0%

02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
have them on the line
 
02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.560 align:start position:0%

02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
i do not yeah i did not see the prime
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor for 284
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
again only cordell johnson who is
 
02:13:32.079 --> 02:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
again only cordell johnson who is
available

02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill 284 extends the deadline for
 
02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:37.990 align:start position:0%
bill 284 extends the deadline for
requests

02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
requests
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
or restoration of lots that were
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merged
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
no mr chair i was just going to
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill so that we could
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
we could hear it but you've it looks
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
like you've just done it so i guess i
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't need to
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
all right is there any uh any questions
 
02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
all right is there any uh any questions
uh

02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's not really anyone's questions i
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
can't really answer uh any questions
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter can if anyone has
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh about this i really don't want to
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
entertain discussion
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh prior to uh exactly but uh
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
if we haven't we do have cornell johnson
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
cordo would you like to operate a
 
02:14:26.719 --> 02:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
cordo would you like to operate a
testimony

02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman um and
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
i i did send a letter to the committee
 
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh bill yesterday and as i said in my
 
02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:41.669 align:start position:0%
uh bill yesterday and as i said in my
letter

02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated subject
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
and uh if i if i were to try to
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
go through it here it would probably
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
take me um
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
10 minutes which i suspect you don't
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
listen to uh and and my explanation
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
confuse more than clarify however i
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
think my letter is pretty clear
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is encourage
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
committee members to
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
read the letter that i emailed yesterday
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
or last night maybe
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
we do oppose the bill
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
basically our position is
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
there has been a period during which
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
property owners have been able to
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
request their previously merged lots
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
to be unmerged uh that period has been
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
open for 10 years
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh it will expire at the end of 2021.
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's already been extended once and we
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that it needs to be extended
 
02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:46.069 align:start position:0%
don't think that it needs to be extended
again

02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
um so our position is that the
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh the bill should be found inexpedient
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
given that uh testimony i will resist
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
the temptation to
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
accept this very short bill today
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
and ask many members make sure you
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
make yourself aware of the ancient
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
submitted letter
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
and read it and we will accept it in our
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
next session
 
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:23.650 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.650 --> 02:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this bill
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
on house bill 284 as presented
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
again i'd like to ask you to make sure
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
you have several hands up i i didn't i
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
see one hand up
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative and then
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative power had her real hand
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
up a moment ago
 
02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
up a moment ago
okay

02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chairman i have a
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
question for
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
mr johnston um
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
the uh description uh
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
says that this bill requests a
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
restoration of lots that are
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merged
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
i i understand people will merge lots
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
more on a voluntary they want to do it
 
02:17:26.399 --> 02:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
more on a voluntary they want to do it
because

02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
they want to lower their taxes but could
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
you explain to me what an
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
i can uh this was this was a very
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
long explanation that i was trying to
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
spare you
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
um and it is in my letter which i
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
realize you probably didn't
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
get because you're not a regular member
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
but i'll i'll summarize it as briefly as
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
surprises when when a town adopts
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
a zoning ordinance and typically it
 
02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
a zoning ordinance and typically it
includes

02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
includes
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
for example minimum lot sizes in the
 
02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
for example minimum lot sizes in the
ordinance

02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
so if your town adopts a an ordinance
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
with a one-acre minimum lot
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
size and you have an existing
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
lot that's half an acre that is now a
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
non-conforming lot
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it can't be developed unless the
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
town includes what's called a
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
grandfather clause
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
in its ordinance which allows
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
for the development of pre-existing lots
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
and most towns do have a grandfather
 
02:18:38.319 --> 02:18:39.349 align:start position:0%
and most towns do have a grandfather
clause

02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
clause
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
that allows for the development of
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
pre-existing lots
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
but if you have several
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
non-conforming lots that are adjacent
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
to each other many town zoning
 
02:18:54.319 --> 02:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
to each other many town zoning
ordinances

02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
will treat the and their their
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
substandard lots
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
many town ordinances will treat those as
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
automatically merged so as to
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
result in one lot that does conform
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
um rather than a bus rather than several
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
substandard lots
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
so the issue is if i have three
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
substandard lots that were
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
automatically merged when the ordinance
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
was adopted
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
there was this enactment ten years ago
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
that allowed me to go to the town
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
and essentially unmerge those lots
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
um and and that the restoration of those
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
of those merged lots
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
now creating several substandard lots
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
again creates
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
significant uh concerns
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
but when this was when this statute was
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
enacted back in
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
2011 um it gave people
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
at first a five-year period during which
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
they could go to the town and request
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
that their
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be restored that period was extended
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
for an additional five years and now
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill requests
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that it be extended for two more years
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our position is it's been extended
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
long enough
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh property owners have had enough time
 
02:20:19.439 --> 02:20:20.469 align:start position:0%
uh property owners have had enough time
to

02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
to do this um
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the bill is unnecessary okay
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you mr chair
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
so um my understanding is that a
 
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
municipality may
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merge lots
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of zoning assessing or
 
02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:48.550 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of zoning assessing or
taxation

02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
and furthermore it's my understanding
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
the majority of such an action is done
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
for purposes of that
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
of taxation and billing um
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
to um i guess change the tax map
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
to make it administratively more
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
easy for the municipality to bill the
 
02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:12.550 align:start position:0%
easy for the municipality to bill the
landowner

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
so my question is is this is if
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
this um bill were itled
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
how would a land owner know
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
that in further additionally
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not do not have to
 
02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:30.630 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not do not have to
notice

02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
the landowner that their um
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
land was involuntarily merged
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding so the question
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
is is if this is itled
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
or you know and if this um
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
provision to request
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
the unmerging is done away with
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
how what recourse does a landowner have
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
at this point to have this addressed
 
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.309 align:start position:0%
at this point to have this addressed
without

02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
expending um money to have a licensed
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
land surveyor take care of this do you
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
i think so and what i forgot to mention
 
02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
i think so and what i forgot to mention
um

02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
when i was responding to representative
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
pimentel is
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
that um before the
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2011 gave
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
property owners the right to
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
unmerge their lots the year before that
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
it passed a law that prohibited any
 
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
it passed a law that prohibited any
future

02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
involuntary mergers so since 2010
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
no municipality has been allowed to
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh effect an involuntary merger of lots
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the problem um the problem should
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
be going away uh or has been going away
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
over the last 11 years so i i think that
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
that takes care of the problem going
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
forward and all property owners who
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
had their lots involuntarily merged have
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
had this
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up yes follow-up
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you so my follow-up is um
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
i was just curious to know
 
02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
um was there any provision that
 
02:23:24.439 --> 02:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
um was there any provision that
municipalities

02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
would then notice any
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
landowners um that
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
their land had been involuntarily
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
emerged in light of the fact that
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
um since 2010 my understanding is that
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
no municipality can
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
involuntarily emerge that was a detail
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
that i was not aware of
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
so my concern is yeah my concern is is
 
02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:50.230 align:start position:0%
so my concern is yeah my concern is is
for

02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
people that just might not be informed
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
therefore this um opportunity
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
to unmerge their land just goes away
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and there was a notice
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh provision in the in the
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute in um
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
in 2011 it it wasn't
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know individual notice to every
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
property owner because if
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
it actually be possible for a town
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
to to necessarily know
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
every property that had been
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merged
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
but there was a requirement and towns
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
did follow this
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
that for a five-year period beginning
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
in 2011 they had to post a notice
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
in a public place which typically was
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
done at the town hall or city hall
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
notifying people of their right to have
 
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:50.550 align:start position:0%
notifying people of their right to have
their

02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
lots unmerged and they had to include
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same notice
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
in their annual report uh
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
every year through 2016. and again
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think there was pretty good compliance
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative a question for you
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that is as i read this
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
the current law is the
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
restoration of involuntarily very
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
flawless is
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the books and so this this
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill is not challenging whether a lot
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
either voluntary voluntarily or
 
02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:36.630 align:start position:0%
either voluntary voluntarily or
involuntarily

02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
involuntarily
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's currently lost as we see it the
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that this
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
for effectivity from 2021 to 2023
 
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's correct this
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
this merely changes the uh the deadline
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
for people to uh
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
to request that their lots be unmerged
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
and have the legal right to have that
 
02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:12.469 align:start position:0%
and have the legal right to have that
happen

02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
so so uh next question is it's
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
it the committee for us
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
citizen uh wants to challenge
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should be
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
involuntarily bridging lines that would
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
be a different
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
but right um uh
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
since since 2010 there has been
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
a prohibition on any
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
any further involuntary merger
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing that towns thank you mr
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
chairman i'm guessing towns want this
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
just to put this
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh this whole matter to bed but the
 
02:27:14.319 --> 02:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
uh this whole matter to bed but the
question

02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
to to you uh cordell is uh
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
mr johnston do
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
i mean wouldn't i know that my
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
property was verged just by looking at
 
02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:27.910 align:start position:0%
property was verged just by looking at
my

02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
tax bill that i look at every year
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would think so yes thank you
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay and we will we'll take that up an
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
all right the last uh matter of the day
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
move into executive session on the
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment patrick number
 
02:28:13.439 --> 02:28:15.429 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment patrick number
nine

02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
nine
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
you remember that that was the
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
a quick summary was to put a tax
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
increase limit
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
of two percent on everybody in a
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
particular town
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
and one percent on on those disabled
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh and seniors if that helps uh
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
remind everybody of the bill we're
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
look to uh representative motion
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%

02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
second it's been seconded by

representative true there's a discussion
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have some
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill um i and i understand
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the uh the sponsor
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
um brought it through in good faith and
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i do understand the
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
the issue we have with our um
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
our seniors and and disabled um disabled
 
02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
our seniors and and disabled um disabled
um

02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
residents and so on but we do have
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions that we
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh we work for them and i went back and
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
i and i looked at all the exemptions
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
that that nashua has and so on and
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
and we have the um the elderly
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
we have the dis disabled we have blind
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
we have deaf
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
um education specialties and so on as
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
well as the veterans
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
doing this um for seniors
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
limiting them to the one percent um
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
beyond looking at the two percent
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
without a means test
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
means that someone literally could have
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
a million dollar home
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
million dollar income and a million
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
dollars assets
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
on top of the home and um their taxes
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
would be reduced
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
i i would think that the the person who
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
forward was not thinking about um that
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
so that's one of my main concerns
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
overall i do have concerns of
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
of um the way that the the tax
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
rate is set it's set by the dra
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the city does their or the town does
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and as we all know that's the
 
02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
and and as we all know that's the
process

02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
then based on their need the dra will
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
set the rate
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
i i'm confused as how this will happen
 
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
um if the dra
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
says well your rate will go up say four
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
percent or
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
three and a half percent does the city
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
then have to go and redo their budget
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
um because it's also relative to the
 
02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
assessed value of the homes and so on so
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm just a little confused by i know
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
what the intent is
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm confused as to how this would
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually happen
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
with the dra and etc and
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
for that reason i really have to oppose
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
this i do understand them want
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
to keep our taxes down our real estate
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
taxes down
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
but as long as the um state and i know
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know this is a
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
moment of controversy and i i'm trying
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
not to be partisan or
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
bring up any of the uglies but the state
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
does downshift cost
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
the retirement cost has now been changed
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
the education cost is coming down and i
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
can tell you that
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 11 million downshift in
 
02:31:56.720 --> 02:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 11 million downshift in
nashua

02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um for this year this will
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
kill us and then on top of it if you're
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
limited to two percent and one percent
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think they're going to be a lot of
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are going to fall
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
within this so
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
those are my comments and thank you for
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
letting me be heard
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um being
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
a newbie on this committee
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is creating a lot of confusion uh
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
in my mind when i served on the school
 
02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
in my mind when i served on the school
board

02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
in nashua you know we rely on property
 
02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.030 align:start position:0%
in nashua you know we rely on property
tax

02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
revenue to fund our education
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
and you know taking away the
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
ability for the municipalities
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
or limiting their ability to
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
juggle their revenue and expenditures
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i feel like we are tying the hands of
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
the local you know we
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
on one hand we want the local control
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
in management and at the same time
 
02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's contradicting you know i'm
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
sitting through these
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings and exacting it's
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
contradicting in so many ways
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
so but also looking at i got a lot
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
more phone calls and emails regarding
 
02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
more phone calls and emails regarding
this

02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
which you know my constituents also sent
 
02:33:26.479 --> 02:33:27.429 align:start position:0%
which you know my constituents also sent
it

02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
40 opposed enforce support on the blue
 
02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.309 align:start position:0%
40 opposed enforce support on the blue
sheet

02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know looking at just purely from the
 
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
democratic process
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
i feel that you know i
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
i agree we have to support the most
 
02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:48.309 align:start position:0%
i agree we have to support the most
vulnerable

02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
i am with them i you know
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
i understand but we also
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to keep the well-being of our
 
02:33:57.359 --> 02:33:58.309 align:start position:0%
have to keep the well-being of our
community

02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i think this limits that ability
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
and uh that's that's it that's my
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
biggest concern
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
downshifting and tying the hands at the
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
same time
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have two points to
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
make one is a little bit of a history
 
02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:21.750 align:start position:0%
make one is a little bit of a history
lesson

02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
lesson
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
um i always hesitate to support
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments for this
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
reason back in the
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
1880s the legislature met
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
from january to june one time
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
and at that time you could buy a nice
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
piece of property
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
for a hundred dollars in that time
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
it was decided by the good people of new
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire that they should pay their
 
02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:51.429 align:start position:0%
hampshire that they should pay their
legislators

02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars for a two-year
 
02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:54.870 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars for a two-year
session

02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and that passed because obviously
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
they thought it was a good salary for
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the legislators and now here we are
 
02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
for the legislators and now here we are
in

02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
2021 being paid 200 dollars
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
for two year job that's pretty much
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
from january to june sometimes then
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
starting up again in august and going
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
through january again and then starting
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
all over again
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a full-time job and the
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
that was passed then subsequently had
 
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
of making it very difficult for someone
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
who is a working person
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to support a family to become a
 
02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.270 align:start position:0%
trying to support a family to become a
legislator

02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
and also have an income to support their
 
02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
and also have an income to support their
family

02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
in it consequently we have a lot of
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
elderly people who can serve we might
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
have some
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
self-employed people who can serve but
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
the people
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
who represent that whole group of people
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 20
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and 55 are very small
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think that was an unintended
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
consequence and it's hard to get rid of
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
i feel the same way about this
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that limits
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
the increase in property taxes to two
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
percent a year
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um if it's in the constitution
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to happen in
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
10 years we don't know what the
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
what the economy will be
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the state will be
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
doing we don't know what the state's
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be we don't know what
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
the town's needs are going to be
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
and if we are tied by the constitution
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult to meet
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
the needs possibly
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
and my second disagreement with this
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
is that towns and cities are already
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
set a tax cap in their community if they
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
so choose
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's working maybe for them or not
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
working for them
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
but i i firmly believe that this
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee should not enact
 
02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that affects
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
every town and city and in the state
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
where it might not be wanted or needed
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
in those towns and cities it makes it
 
02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.389 align:start position:0%
in those towns and cities it makes it
universal

02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
universal
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
everybody has to do it it's a mandate
 
02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:19.590 align:start position:0%
everybody has to do it it's a mandate
and

02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
um i think given all the reasons
 
02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
everyone else has given about property
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
taxes and
 
02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know god bless might have gone up
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
again this year and they've gone up 20
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the last five years on my house i
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand i'm
 
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
one of those old people who chooses
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
between medicine and property taxes
 
02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:37.830 align:start position:0%
between medicine and property taxes
sometimes

02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
but that being said this is a
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
bad idea in my opinion let the people in
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
the communities decide for themselves
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
don't make the mandate that they have to
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
do it thank you
 
02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
do it thank you
representative

02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i have to agree
 
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i have to agree
that

02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
as it is now towns are allowed to adopt
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
an elderly exemption but there has to be
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
a means test
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so that we don't get the
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
as representative clea i don't i don't
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
want to repeat everything
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
that she said but i agree with
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
everything that she said
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and if i'm understanding this bill
 
02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:21.349 align:start position:0%
um and if i'm understanding this bill
correctly

02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
there the two percent cap is on the
 
02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
there the two percent cap is on the
actual

02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
actual
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
tax bill not on the rate
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
and what that means is your revenue is
 
02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:33.030 align:start position:0%
and what that means is your revenue is
flat

02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
flat
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
and and its potential and probably
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
likelihood that municipalities bond
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
rating is going to
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
you we'll come back to you so in the
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
meantime i'll move to
 
02:38:58.399 --> 02:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
meantime i'll move to
representative

02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh some of the
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
points i wanted to make have already
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
been made
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
the most egregious being the fact that
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
allow towns to um
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh have exemptions but this is a mandate
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
and um if i can't i can't
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
if a town can't afford it then
 
02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're really in trouble the other
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
thing i don't like about this
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of towns especially poorer
 
02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:33.110 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of towns especially poorer
towns

02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh form their budgets on what they need
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
for that year and
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
those towns budgets are more likely to
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
have to fluctuate
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
from year to year by more than two
 
02:39:47.359 --> 02:39:48.550 align:start position:0%
from year to year by more than two
percent

02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh because of a big expense that they
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
have for that year
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we do this man if we
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
pass this uh constitutional amendment
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
these towns will be forced to not pay
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
with cash
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
these big expenses but they will be
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
forced to
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
bond everything in order to maintain
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
that below two percent margin and we're
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to put towns
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh it looks like all
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
our electrons are back moving it in so
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to representative
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i've made my the end
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
of my point
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
right at the left at the appropriate
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
time or maybe not appropriate but
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
time i needed thank you thank you next
 
02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:40.070 align:start position:0%
time i needed thank you thank you next
is

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you mr chair
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
fascinating discussion and oftentimes i
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't remember what
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
um bringers of bills or people offering
 
02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:52.870 align:start position:0%
um bringers of bills or people offering
testimony

02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
say to us specifically this one i do
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
remember and i remember very clearly
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy saying to us
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
that this was a way to start a
 
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
conversation about taxes
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
well i don't think this is a way to
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
start a conversation about taxes i think
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is a way to start a conversation
 
02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
this is a way to start a conversation
about

02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
one slice of what we do in new hampshire
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
taxes and paying for what we want
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i think a better bill would be a
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill that is a grown-up bill and talks
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
about an
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
income tax that's my favored tax
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
versus more property taxes because as
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter said in her little
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
history lesson
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know in the 1880s if you owned land
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
you were wealthy you had money
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
you you you could do what you wanted
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you didn't own land that wasn't the
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
case well now it's a flip side of that
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
story and it's changed over the
 
02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
story and it's changed over the
centuries

02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
centuries
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
and we need to face up to the fact that
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
we need revenue to run a state
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
we want to have nice things we need to
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
stop having nice things on the backs
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
of property owners and we need to start
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
having nice things
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
by sharing the burden i think a
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment needs to be
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
very very very very very well thought
 
02:42:12.309 --> 02:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
out and careful because
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
once you've got it you own it for a long
 
02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
once you've got it you own it for a long
time

02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
and this is this is not a good
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment in my opinion
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we have one more comment
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
taking the question um on this uh
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
question on this uh bill i i think that
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.269 --> 02:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a good way to start
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
um i just don't uh
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think we'll have page on this in the
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
house for passes out of committee
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
and you know they then if it passed out
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
of committee
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire would
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
decide for this and that's
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute yourself there jim
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
what i was trying to say thank you and i
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
apologize is that i don't mean to have
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
the last word but if i put my hand up as
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
the co-host it sends me to the front of
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
the line and i don't want to jump ahead
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but my concern here uh i i'll i will
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
say i
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative klee and
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
everything that she said certainly with
 
02:43:57.670 --> 02:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
the downshifting and with no means
 
02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:58.630 align:start position:0%
the downshifting and with no means
testing

02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
but i also reflect on the fact that like
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
many other many of the other 234 towns
 
02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
many other many of the other 234 towns
in

02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire my town has a capital
 
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
improvements committee
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
that has a 10-year plan for
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
our routine active maintenance and our
 
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
replacement of vehicles
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
of buildings of projects
 
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
as i stated in in or asked the question
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
of representative the sponsor
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill we also have collective
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements and i have to
 
02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements and i have to
wonder

02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
where if we have a two percent cap if if
 
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
a town
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
like mine and many others that takes
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
that active role in trying
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
to manage expenses so that we are
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
sensitive to
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
every one of our taxpayers if i'm
 
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly going to have to
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
say no we can't do the ambulance this
 
02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
say no we can't do the ambulance this
year

02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
and we can't do the road paving this
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
year and i'm sorry
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know collective bargaining you know
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
i still think that that's going to
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
create a problem with collective
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining if i
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
walk into a meeting and say guys i'm
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
right up against a two percent cap so
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know you ain't getting anything
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
this year i i think that runs a risk of
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
of uh of a grievance because we wouldn't
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
be able to bargain in good faith
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i i i can't support
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
this uh the cacr although the discussion
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
is fine i just can't support this bill
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you in the llp
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
here we have representative
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
tripp thank you mr chair
 
02:45:35.269 --> 02:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
um i've heard
 
02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
twice today comments that uh
 
02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
well the lemonade stand bill uh people
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
saying that uh
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
this should be left up for the town it's
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
not to be governed by the state
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh i heard another comment that uh
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh tax cap should be local decision
 
02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
should not be a
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
state mandate and then uh
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
i also heard a comment that uh why don't
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
we have an income tax
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering would that be a local
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh thing too
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
or is this should be something that
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
i think that we have different
 
02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:21.110 align:start position:0%
i think that we have different
viewpoints

02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
viewpoints
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
on what should be a state law and what
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that uh
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
that uh i know that that the
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
what's being discussed now is isn't uh
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
but i suspect that should
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
the point never come around to wanting
 
02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:53.670 align:start position:0%
the point never come around to wanting
to

02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
talk about income tax it wouldn't be a
 
02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
local decision
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we can't if we can't make decisions
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
on lemonade stands or tax caps then i'd
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly be against
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%

voting uh and that is
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh the vote was
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately challenged
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
and uh this current during the first
 
02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
and uh this current during the first
week

02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have a question
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes um would this be
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this be similar to if i was in
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
the room lob
 
02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
room and left while the vote we were in
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
the voting mode or just
 
02:56:35.429 --> 02:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
the discussion left the room i cannot
 
02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
until that and then would that be an
 
02:56:39.439 --> 02:56:40.150 align:start position:0%
until that and then would that be an
opportunity

02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
where it would be reconsidered the vote
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing right i'm
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
participating virtually
 
02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
so if i leave the room
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i come back
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i lost my chance to vote so will i
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
get the same privilege
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
of being reconsidered to vote my
 
02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
conscience the motion is made by a
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are certain times when
 
02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:24.250 align:start position:0%

there's only one chair i again
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
protest i believe that representative
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
mcbride is at work
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know how he has the privilege of
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
being at work
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
well we're all here so here's my second
 
02:57:58.389 --> 02:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
protest of the day
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
nothing personal representative mcbride
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
yet now we're hearing your business
 
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
yet now we're hearing your business
conversations

02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i am so upset at how this has been

and i am so upset at how this has been
handled

02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
handled
 
02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay so the reminder is that if you're
 
02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
not recognized to speak you should be
 
02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:13.429 align:start position:0%
not recognized to speak you should be
unused

02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
unused
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
to avoid those embarrassing situations
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%

03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much done with our business we
 
03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
don't have any further bills to exec
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know for you i see a lot
 
03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
of scowls but
 
03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:53.830 align:start position:0%
of scowls but
representative

03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just really out of it today
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
on my list i see
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
hb 67 relative to warren
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
articles in efficient ballot towns
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
school district
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
or village district meetings as a bill
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
we were going to exec
 
03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
today did we already exact that bill
 
03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
have i lost my mind
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
67 is not ready to exact uh there's we
 
03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand there is a
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and you might want to
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
check with with uh
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
mr clerk paul smith my understanding
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
is if it's listed as a bill that's going
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
to be exact at a certain time
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
and date if that changes it needs to be
 
03:01:40.479 --> 03:01:41.590 align:start position:0%
and date if that changes it needs to be
noticed

03:01:41.590 --> 03:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
so people who come to hear the executive
 
03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:44.950 align:start position:0%
so people who come to hear the executive
session

03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
will know that it's not going to happen
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
might not be such an issue
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we have remote meetings now but
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes people drive long distances
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
to get to an executive session
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
just you might want to check i might be
 
03:02:01.030 --> 03:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
wrong on this again
 
03:02:03.410 --> 03:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
but you might want to check that
 
03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:05.110 align:start position:0%
but you might want to check that
[Music]

03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh i just wanna you know if uh we're
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to get some clarification i would
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
really like to get the clarification
 
03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:12.790 align:start position:0%
really like to get the clarification
about

03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:02:16.710 --> 03:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
voting um in the committee
 
03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
from uh clerk paul smith about leaving
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
the room coming back
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
virtual or in reality i would really
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
like that clarification thank you
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
well you all should know that i
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
disallowed the vote
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
from uh representative who uh we lost
 
03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
contact with visually
 
03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then the bill was uh reconsidered
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
i understand mr chair
 
03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:52.630 align:start position:0%
i understand mr chair
but

03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
to would that be a consideration
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
extended to every member because i'm new
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
to this committee
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
and um and just serving in my fifth
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
term and uh doing
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
i just want a clarification that's all
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
the committee member
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
unavailable to vote at a particular time
 
03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they both cannot count it
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's the rule but if
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
a particular bill is reconsidered then
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
you start over
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then the same rules apply under the
 
03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:47.429 align:start position:0%
and then the same rules apply under the
reconsideration

03:03:47.429 --> 03:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
and any bill in the
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
stillman committee can be reconsidered
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
by a motion from a member of the
 
03:03:57.279 --> 03:03:58.469 align:start position:0%
by a motion from a member of the
committee

03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
the bill has to be still in our
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
possession once the bill has
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
been transmitted the clerk of court
 
03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
may not be reconsidered at the
 
03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
may not be reconsidered at the
commitment

03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the that's the difference
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
between that emotion reconsider is
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
so when will when will i know that the
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
these bills that we exacted
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
has left the committee so do i have to
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we exacted in the
 
03:04:30.319 --> 03:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we exacted in the
last

03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
three committee meetings and i still
 
03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
work you know think about okay some of
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
them could be reconsidered
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the decision reversed based on uh
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
the day it was reconsidered or is there
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
a limit on which
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's no limited time frame if you
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
want to uh find out if a
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill has been forwarded to the clerk
 
03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:55.269 align:start position:0%
bill has been forwarded to the clerk
with

03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
contact with our clerk he's the one that
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
puts together the folder and sends it
 
03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
puts together the folder and sends it
forward

03:05:02.230 --> 03:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:05:04.150 --> 03:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
he can tell you whether the bill has
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
been forwarded
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
or still in the projection of the
 
03:05:07.359 --> 03:05:10.309 align:start position:0%
or still in the projection of the
committee

03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.319 --> 03:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
i had a similar question um i was
 
03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:18.150 align:start position:0%
i had a similar question um i was
wondering

03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
if we how we know at what point
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
a bill has left our hands because i
 
03:05:26.230 --> 03:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
always foolishly assumed that once we
 
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
had executable
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
that it had left our hands and there was
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
no pulling it back
 
03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
but clearly i was misinformed
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
so i guess the answer is i can ask the
 
03:05:38.479 --> 03:05:39.269 align:start position:0%
so i guess the answer is i can ask the
clerk

03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
whether a bill has been received in the
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to find out
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether we have actually given over
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
control of it
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
right it's a little different this year
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
because the fact that
 
03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
the clerks that support us
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
are all basically remote so
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
when the file folders are ready
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be uh sent they don't actually
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
they don't normally go right away in
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
previous years they were handed off to
 
03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
previous years they were handed off to
the

03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee assistant and the committee
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
assistant then
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
do a quality control check on the folder
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure all the different pieces of
 
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
paper are complete and then send it over
 
03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
paper are complete and then send it over
to

03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
the deployer uh nowadays um
 
03:06:27.990 --> 03:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of remote
 
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
digital documentation that has to
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
be printed out and populated in the
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
folder and the folder has to be
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
at some point picked up from the led and
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
transmitted over
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the uh this part and a cotton
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
and copy so that i have to go to the
 
03:06:47.359 --> 03:06:49.349 align:start position:0%
and copy so that i have to go to the
assistant

03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
since the many of the clerks are
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually virtually i believe all the
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
clerics are remote that
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
when you leave a folder in the led to be
 
03:06:59.279 --> 03:07:00.550 align:start position:0%
when you leave a folder in the led to be
transmitted

03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
transmitted
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's not like it was in the past just
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
hand it to the clark assistant and move
 
03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
hand it to the clark assistant and move
forward

03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
is left
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
picked up and then viewed and then
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
and then distributed so it's a little
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
longer time period
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's a little different and those were
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
still in architecture in fact most
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
everything is still in our projection
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
because in many cases we're waiting for
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee reports for both my minority
 
03:07:57.269 --> 03:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
and the majority i think we've
 
03:08:00.230 --> 03:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
cleared most of that up but until those
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
are done
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're not transmitting the file forward
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's a piece of the file that has to
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
be populated with
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna take a five minute
 
03:08:24.309 --> 03:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
recess and then
 
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh don't go away we're gonna come right
 
03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
uh don't go away we're gonna come right
back

03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%

03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%

porter

03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
porter
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh we need to ask you and then go
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
forward please
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i was wondering if you could
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
tell me if
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
hb 586 the governor's
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
executive governor's housing bill is
 
03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
executive governor's housing bill is
going

03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
likely to be reconsidered at another
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
session because i have a
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
an interview with the press in about
 
03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
15 minutes and i want to make sure that
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not giving
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information to the public
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
is i've had no input from anybody on the
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee that they wish to reconsider
 
03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
committee that they wish to reconsider
586

03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
586
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
but that's not to say that that couldn't
 
03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
happen in the future
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
is that an early bill mr chair yeah
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's an early bill
 
03:17:51.990 --> 03:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's already been transmitted to the
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
clerk okay
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
so it's out of our hands now yes it is
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
so no reconsideration motion can be made
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
in this committee on that bill
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
that was that passed the ocp by a vote
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair for taking my
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
question or a comment today's
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
executive session is really
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
kind of put me in a very confused state
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
like i said this is my fifth term i've
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
served on criminal justice
 
03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
state and federal and veterans affair
 
03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
and this is my third committee that i'm
 
03:18:43.520 --> 03:18:45.670 align:start position:0%
and this is my third committee that i'm
serving

03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
serving
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
and so from today's proceeds
 
03:18:55.750 --> 03:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
i am really left very confused
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
if i attend and participate in an
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
like i did today and i've done in the
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
last three
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
i cannot participate in the next
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee meeting whatever my vote was
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's was considered that
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
that bill can be reconsidered and that
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
could change
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
so how am i representing my constituents
 
03:19:33.030 --> 03:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
and i did my due diligence
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that being overturned
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
i feel that that is not
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of this democratic process
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
i take my responsibility of representing
 
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
and serving this is
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
my prime duty
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
i take it and so i feel like it's being
 
03:20:08.550 --> 03:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
undermined i would really like to
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
get a clarification
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
from a clerk of the house
 
03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
and i understand we are in a pandemic i
 
03:20:18.319 --> 03:20:19.670 align:start position:0%
and i understand we are in a pandemic i
appreciate

03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that i can do it virtually
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
and safely so i can stay alive
 
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
to participate and do my due diligence
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
and service so this is
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
very disturbing to me if i could
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
kindly ask for a clarification i would
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate that
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay this kind of thing has never
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the last four
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
terms that's what i'm trying to say and
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
your question you can you can rely on me
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to get a clarification for
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
you but if
 
03:21:01.830 --> 03:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh or you can go directly to the clerk
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
or to your
 
03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
minority leadership uh to pursue the
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
question so you create
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
a variety of sources to get that
 
03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
a variety of sources to get that
information

03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
what would you like to see happen
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
i would defer to my minority leadership
 
03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i think i can ask
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
for clarification thank you
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess that at this point uh
 
03:21:29.429 --> 03:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative porter the
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
fault on your court to get clarification
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
unless you
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
unless you want me to do it on your
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
behalf okay
 
03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:38.319 align:start position:0%

03:21:38.319 --> 03:21:39.990 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to answer to get
representative

03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
session and
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think that's permissible but
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure if we are all together
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
as a committee whether that constitutes
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
having a quorum
 
03:23:07.750 --> 03:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
and my understanding of the right to
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
know law
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
is that if a quorum is present it
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a public meeting
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm i just don't want anyone to get
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
into any kind of
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
right to know issue if we if we are
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
together as a committee although not yet
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
open to the public
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
if statements can be made off the record
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know so you might want to check
 
03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
i don't know so you might want to check
that

03:23:33.190 --> 03:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe christina dyer knows that
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
answer or maybe
 
03:23:39.510 --> 03:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
clark smith knows that answer i will
 
03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
take that out
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
here we just uh just reminded that we do
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
have house sessions
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm currently looking at trying to get
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
our next meeting scheduled and i'll
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'll notify you as soon as i get that so
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
you can
 
03:24:20.790 --> 03:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
um overlay that on your personal
 
03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:22.389 align:start position:0%
um overlay that on your personal
calendar

03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
you have enough notice to get right into
 
03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:34.229 align:start position:0%
you have enough notice to get right into
that

03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
um we need to talk maybe you and me
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
about who's going to do
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
defenses and speeches on the floor and
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
03:24:47.190 --> 03:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
you need to make sure that leadership on
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%

03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
luxury if you will of getting the
 
03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:20.880 align:start position:0%

much mr chair did i hear that
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
after the next house meeting we are
 
03:25:58.950 --> 03:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to be meeting in person
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
would this option be taken out
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
next time i'll be on the committee will
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
be on march
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
1st and i don't have any indication that
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
that the blended meeting will exactly
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
authorize but i'm an official band it
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
will still be joining soon
 
03:26:20.550 --> 03:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
that option is still on the table right
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been pulled under the right i
 
03:26:22.479 --> 03:26:26.389 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been pulled under the right i
mean

03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
