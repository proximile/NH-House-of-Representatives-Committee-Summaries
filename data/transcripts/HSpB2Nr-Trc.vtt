Moffet and um part of the reason for
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
having this session today uh has to do
 
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
with one of our committee members who
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
shared a story with me uh he is not able
 
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
to be here today he has to work but he
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
asked if I would share his story um he
 
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
is himself a veteran representative
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
finny and um he found himself in crisis
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
in such crisis that his friends said to
 
00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
him if you don't go to the hospital now
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
we will call the police because that's
 
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 align:start position:0%
what we know to do in the community
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
right if someone's in crisis we don't
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
know what El to do send them to the
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
hospital or call the police so he did at
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
the behest of his friend go to the
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
hospital and the hospital examined him
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
and released him with no assistance
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and so he is very concerned
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
because he said you know when I was in
 
00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.710 align:start position:0%
because he said you know when I was in
the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
military you knew if you were in crisis
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
you kept it to yourself you sucked it up
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
and you worked through battled through
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
your demons and he said but going to a
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
hospital admitting that you had demons
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
and that you were struggling and then
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
being turned
 
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
away to go back and do exactly what You'
 
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
had done while
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
difficult and um I can't tell you in in

because of the VA that I was able to

um what I'd like to do is start a little
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
bit from sort of the larger picture of
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
the overall VA suicide prevention
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
program and then that will uh uh sort of
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
naturally come down to what I do and a
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more of what's Happening Here
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
um the Veterans Crisis Line that folks
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
are potentially familiar with if you
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
dial 988 and then press one rather than
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
reaching the local uh Crisis Line you
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
will get transferred to the va's
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
Veterans Crisis Line where we've got uh
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%

the folks that answer the phone are uh
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk to somebody who uh
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%

the the um folks on the other end of the
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
phone line they start by just getting a
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
sense of what's happening for that
 
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
individual and triaging the situation

Services underway to support that person
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
if that's what's needed that does not
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
always happen it doesn't have it's not
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
an automatic roll out like if you called
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
911 the at the end of the call depending
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
on how things go if the person would
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
like they can be referred and connected
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
to their local VA at which point uh that
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
call then gets referred locally to our

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
um through and coordinated by The
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention coordinators we have
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
our general mental health clinic so that
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
winds up being part of our Suicide
 
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
winds up being part of our Suicide
Prevention

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
Prevention
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
structure full range of mental healthc
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
care is available um either at at our
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
local VA or folks can be referred to one
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the other medical centers in the
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
region um we have the entire VA at our
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
disposal as
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
needed um the VA offers what we call
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
Same Day Access if somebody walked in
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
the idea really centers around the no
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
wrong door approach which means if
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
somebody walked in off the street
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
somebody would be able to meet with them
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
now what that tends to involve would be
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
triaging the situation identifying if
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis and if we need to
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
respond in a crisis situation we would
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
do so accordingly uh and then it's if
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's more routine then that person will
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
leave with a referral when an
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
appointment to come back uh but the idea
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
being that we've have folks that are
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
ready to support veterans
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
um at any point in time during our
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
business hours uh that is one of the
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
um sort of unique aspects of the
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester VA is that we are not a full
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
service Medical Center um
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
the two full service medical centers uh
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
that folks may be familiar with that
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
have emergency rooms in the full uh
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
range of care uh are White River
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
Junction I uh central Massachusetts and
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
the Boston area uh there are other
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
medical centers in around Manchester has
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
an Urgent Care uh Bedford has an Urgent
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
Care um and then there's also various
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
ancillary services that are available
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
there as
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
well uh the mental health service has a
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
mental health case manager it's a nurse
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
who's assigned with a assisting with the
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
facilitation of transfers between
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
facilities or between emergency room and
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
Community providers so if somebody
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
showed up to the Elliot emergency room
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
and Elliott is looking to get that
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
person transferred to right River
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
Junction just for an example this is
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who's there to who's working to
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
build those connections and make those
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
um transitions as smooth as
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
possible my role is part of the
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
community based interventions for
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention it's a fairly new
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
program when I was hired about a year
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
and a half ago uh this was a new
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
position for the Manchester VA the idea
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
is that with over half of veterans that
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
are eligible for VA care choose not to
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
pursue their care at the VA for us to
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
have a true impact on veteran suicide we
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
need to support our veterans in the
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
community where they're getting their
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
care and get beyond the walls of the
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
medical center
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
C the VA VA has identified that the that
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
the best way to get out there and
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
to uh quickly multiply that uh effort is
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
through community coalitions and
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
building coalitions my job is to build
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
those community coalitions support our
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh Partners in the community uh in order
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
to um approach Suicide Prevention from a
 
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
public health perspective that includes
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
training Community folks in suicide
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
prevention and how to talk to somebody
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
who's in crisis and where to find
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
resources it includes
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh folks in the community
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
that are supportive of veterans to
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate with their local providers to
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
encourage them to screen in order to
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
identify veterans because if we're not
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
asking if somebody's a veteran or not
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
then we can't get them Services uh New
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um a national model with
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
the ask the question campaign uh the VA
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
uses New Hampshire as a model for that
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and the whole point is to really
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
encourage as much as possible as
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
universally as possible to ask folks
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
have you or someone or loved one ever
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
served in the military you ask that
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
question and then the idea is you also
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
have to support people in what to do
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
next if the person says yes then what um
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what we're working to
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
do from this public health approach uh
 
00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:38.430 align:start position:0%
do from this public health approach uh
there

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
are we have
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
about there's eight total coalitions in
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
the state so far that came together in
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
the last year one of those coalitions is
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit more administrative it's
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's kind of designed to bring people
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
together to facilitate the process of
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
creating coalitions so it doesn't quite
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
coalitions and the
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we've got the stronger together
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%

involved or if you want to learn more
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%

Coalition they've got some great
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
connections with pouth State University
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh and will be interesting to see how
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
that comes together um the last thing I
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted or or the last Coalition I wanted
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
to mention that folks may be familiar
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
with is the Lakes Region Veterans
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
Coalition that actually came together
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
under a program before I was even hired
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh that was out of the VA Office of
 
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh that was out of the VA Office of
rural

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
rural
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare but the structure of that
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
program overlaps almost perfectly with
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
my job and my role and the nature of the
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
program so we sort of just kept that
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
within the umbrella of all of them
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
together that is uh that contact for
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
that is Kurt Weber um it's up there
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
connected with C Brazilians they're

age and development of a community
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%

families prior to moving to Nami New
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was the um division director
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
for the the division of community- based
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
military programs at the New Hampshire
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
veteran services for many years um when
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
it first opened in 2019 I had already
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
been in that position at DHHS for about
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
a year and a half at that time so come
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
with great experience working in the
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
community-based uh sector of this field
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
and really a passion com coming from a
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
military family um with a strong strong
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
growing up military right my parents
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
grandparents we have a Medal of Honor
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
recipient Pearl Harbor Survivor Vietnam
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
veteran um OE OE o combat veteran um and
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
the the list goes on and on so I grew up
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
thinking that the military was all
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
parades because my grandfather and my
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather you know marching in
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
parades with them um it was for me it
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
was all about balloons and excitement
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's a school named after my
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather in Massachusetts and
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until I became an adult um and
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
really started to work in the field to
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
know that it's not all balloons all the
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
time you know from the the story that
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Carrie shared in the
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
beginning there's really some gaps in
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
Services um I have not served myself but
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I see myself as an advocate for those
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
who have I know for my own family
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
experience typically and for those of
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
you who are veterans I imagine you might
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
find yourself in the same position that
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to be the person who
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
advocates for yourself you know it just
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
feels strange sometimes so I love to
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
step into that role and say yes this is
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
what we need to do for our veterans um
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm so incredibly happy that
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
Justin asked me to join him today so in
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
that folder that I gave to you the one
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm going to refer to the
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
most is this um this big piece here that
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
has the wheel in the middle of it so
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
when you're re and please review it I I
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
put together the folder because I knew
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
we were limited on time so I expect it
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
to supplement what I'm just going to
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
highlight here for you today so I won't
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
be offended that you're reading through
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
it looking at it and not looking at me I
 
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do that um but when
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing this document that I just
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
showed you that has a whole bunch of
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention initiatives for
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
veterans in New Hampshire I hope that
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
two notable aspects will be apparent to
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
you first the broad spectrum of services
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and supports that are available and
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
second the high degree of collaboration
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
that exists between the VA State
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
departments in New Hampshire and
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
Community providers so suicide
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
prevention for veterans is undeniably an
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
important public health issue demanding
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive and multi faceted
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
approach to make a meaningful impact
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
addressing the challenge necessitates an
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
approach that goes beyond individual
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling it requires a
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
broad array of services that span Mental
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
Health Care Community Support education
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
and Outreach initiatives for the
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
military and Veteran community in
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
particular um representative Kerrie had
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
touched on this in the story that you
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
shared in the beginning mental health
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
awareness campaigns play a pivotal role
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
in reducing stigma and encouraging
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
people to seek help when they need it
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
accessible and effective mental health
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
services including counseling Crisis
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
Intervention are imperative components
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
of of the supportive system but
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
additionally community-based programs
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
fostering social connectedness
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
resilience and early intervention
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
contribute to significantly to
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
preventing suicide they all relate to
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
that wheel that you see in the middle
 
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:25.870 align:start position:0%
that wheel that you see in the middle
that

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
really personifies the quality of life
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
for a veteran here in New Hampshire
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration between healthc care
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
providers Educators you as policy makers
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
and Community leaders like us here are
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
essential to create a unified front
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
against the Public Health Challenge of
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
suicide so we really need to emphasize
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing research policy development and
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
this handout for you that I really want
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure you know about are first
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
the governor's challenge to prevent
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
suicide among service members veterans
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
and their families Justin mentioned that
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
it started in
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
2018 um samama and the VA began
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
supporting teams under this program in
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire proudly we were one of
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
seven states to start in that inaug year
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
um since that time we've been active in
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
developing goals and action plans
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
implementing and meeting objectives
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
tracking outcomes and just continually
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
assessing needs so the team continues to
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
meet monthly we're very active as Justin
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're now embedded in the New
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Suicide Prevention Council so
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
that we can have some sustainability
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
there increase our Network um and the
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
impact that we have so this team
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
primarily focused its efforts on
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
educating New Hampshire providers about
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
military culture and suicide prevention
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
promoting the ask the question
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
initiative that Justin mentioned and
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the development of the local
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
veterans coalitions in this past year I
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually had the privilege of going down
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
to work in Washington DC last week with
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
the last eight teams to join the
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
governor's challenge one of those um
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
State teams so seven seven States
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
including Maine actually is one of the
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
last ones to join and the Commonwealth
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
of Northern Mariana Islands so it's
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
exciting that now all 50 states and all
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
US territories have a Governor's
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
challenge team the other thing of
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
notable interest is the staff sergeant
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
grant program it's a big mouthful um but
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
it comes with a lot of responsibility it
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
comes with a lot of funding so we are
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
super excited to have a recipient here
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which is Harbor care so
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
they were awarded this uh Suicide
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
Prevention Grant during the first round
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
of that Federal program they've
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
developed and are implementing at this
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
time a comprehensive array of services
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
focused on suicide prevention for
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
veterans um and they're collaborating
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
with other Statewide groups and the
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
local veterans coalitions as well and
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
then lastly state funded Suicide
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
Prevention projects EAS seals New
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and partnership for public
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
health were selected through a
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
competitive RFP Pro process by um the
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
veteran services last fiscal year to
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
implement services to reduce social
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
isolation um and increase access to
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services for veterans in
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so this funding
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was a one-time allocation
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
it ended last June however both
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
organizations are really continuing that
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
work that they started with the funding
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
so they're now in the process of trying
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to access different
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
funding sources to keep it going or to
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
at least build on what they did do so it
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't completely
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
end um and then lastly and kind of
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
related to that Easter Seals as you may
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
be aware um they were provided an
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
allocation of State funding to move
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
forward with some really Innovative
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
plans to develop a veterans campus in
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Franklin New Hampshire so that's going
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
to offer veterans across New Hampshire a
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive array of services to
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
address many of those social determin of
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
Health that you see on that wheel um
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
from that handout so the good news is
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's a lot the good news is that there
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
is a lot the good news is also that
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2021 the New Hampshire
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
veteran suicide rate continued to
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
decrease um we don't yet have official
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
numbers for
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
2022 um we're hoping that there's a
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
decrease because of
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
covid I'm optimistic but kind kind of
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
holding my breath a little bit um there
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
are a good number of services and
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
resources available to Veterans who want
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
our help our state has a proud history
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
of collaborating across sectors and
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
industries launching Innovative programs
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
with little to no resources um as you
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
all know to be described as Grassroots
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a source of Pride
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
for many
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
organizations um but there definitely
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
are some areas where we need to make
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
some improvements for our veterans the
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
highest rates of veteran suicide occur
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
in the rural areas of New Hampshire
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
despite the existence of many you know
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
of that this shows and that I talked
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
about many services and resources
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
veterans and their families are often
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
unaware of their existence or they have
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
trouble navigating them um I often say
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire veterans don't have a
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
resource problem they have a navigation
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
problem and one reason for that is our
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
lack of a large active milit
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
installation that often serves as a hub
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
of information you know a place where
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
people can get referrals and services
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
and connect with each other it serves as
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
a way to disseminate information for the
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
state department but we don't have that
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as you know we're
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
a National Guard State um so we just
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
need to do a little more creative
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
problem solving so many Grassroots
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
initiatives crucial for veterans lack
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding here in New
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relying on private grants or
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
donations often leading to stunted
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
growth or eventual dissolution numerous
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations provide
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
essential services for veterans uh but
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
their Reliance on unstable funding
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes their continuity for
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
instance we had the military liaison
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
program which was initially funded by
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and the Medicaid balancing
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
incentive program starting back in
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
2015 it had some positive outcomes
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
including an increased uh TR care
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment for our community mental
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
health centers the model gained national
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
attention many states have replicated it
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
but in fortunately funding ceased in
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
2017 and by 2018 only one cmhc still had
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
a military liaison so without financial
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
support these Liaisons instrumental and
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
fostering military cultural competence
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
within their organizations and
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
communities were asked to revert to
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
billable hours in their organization so
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
they went back to providing services
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
like Clinical Services um rather than
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
acting in that military liaison role so
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
it really hindered the organizational
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
capacity to serve veterans effectively
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding is imperative to
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
ensure the longevity and impact of these
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
vital programs as the question initiated
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
in 2015 is another prime example of New
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's commendable initiatives um
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
Al also initially supported by DHHS and
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
bip funding the campaign featured a
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
website a logo a Statewide plan for
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
military culture training and has served
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
as a model for other states in just the
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
past year alone I've done consults with
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
about 20 other states who want to
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
develop their own ask the question
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
campaign but despite its National
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
influence New Hampshire's effort
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
stagnated after the funding ceased in
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
2017 in contrast many states have
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
surpassed New Hampshire they've
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
established legislation and allocated
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
State funds to guide and sustain their
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
ask the question campaigns um so even
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
though I continue to help them develop
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
and get going um they quickly you know
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
surpass what we've done and we lag
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
behind but the good news is that there's
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
so many opportunities for New Hampshire
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
to strengthen Suicide Prevention
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
initiatives for
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
veterans um the establishment of a
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide closed loop referral system by
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
DHHS that's hopefully going to be
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
implemented this summer I am super super
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
excited about it'll allow policy makers
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
and leaders to identify Trends um in
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
service seeking among our New Hampshire
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
veterans and assess the obstacles that
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're facing in accessing accessing
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
those Services I expect it to make it
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
easier for veterans to find what they're
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
looking for and get connected to the
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
care that they need through that davs
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
recently convened stakeholders to
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
identify a path forward for ask the ask
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
the question campaign so this provides
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
an opport opportunity to Breathe new
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
life into that campaign bring new
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
partners like New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
Association to the table and hopefully
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
Identify some new resources as well to
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
make it sustainable and then I also
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
included in your um in your folder uh a
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
list of what some other states have done
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
I did a benchmark study recently for my
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
own purposes just to see what other what
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
other states have done and what we might
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
learn from them so I thought it was
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
really applicable here today so I I
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
popped it in there for you when you scan
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
through those examples you'll notice
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
that many states have passed legislation
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
mandating um that service members and
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
Veterans be identified in places such as
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals State Department programs
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
Corrections programs um or social
 
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
Corrections programs um or social
service

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
agencies the identification is then
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
linked to providing that veteran with
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate resources So currently not
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire emergency departments
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals healthc care agencies or
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers have
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
effective practices to identify someone
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
who has military service some of them
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
ask at intake um some of them do not but
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
even for the ones that do ask the
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
followup when the answer is yes is
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
lacking or not meaningful at all um when
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
I've ask people oh great you you know
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
you do identify service members and
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
Veterans what happens after that the
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
answer is usually like well somebody
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
must know I'm sure the case manager does
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
something you know and then the you
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
follow up with the case manager and the
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
case manager is like oh I didn't even
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
know we asked so there's not really good
 
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
policies and practices um around that
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
and the legislation and some of the
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
other states has helped to guide those
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
entities to move forward with that so
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
looking at what other states have done
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
is definitely an opportunity that we're
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to seize in the coming year um
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
other examples you'll see are creative
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
Innovative programs and resources that
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
help veterans find the care and services
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
they need and easily access them almost
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
all of them have been supported by
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
federal Andor State funds so they can be
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
scaled expanded Statewide and
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable which is the most important
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
part so funding allocations as we move
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
forward here in New Hampshire need to be
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
clearly marked for a specific veteran
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
initiative in order to guarantee that
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
those funds will be used in the ways
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
that they were intended Grassroots is
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
exciting it's flashy everybody takes
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
pride in it um but it's not what we owe
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
our veterans I believe that we we have
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
we owe our veterans a level of
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
commitment that's sustainable and not
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
just flashy and Grassroots so as we The
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention Council military and
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
veterans committee move into 2024 we
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
plan to critically assess our
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
achievements over the past five years
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
and what's required in the next three 3
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
to 5 years to meet the needs of New
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans and continue
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing the rate of new the New
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veteran suicide rate so I hope
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
you can tell that I'm super passionate
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
about what I do can obviously Jus and I
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
can both answer questions now if there's
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
time but you do have my business card so
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
please please follow up if you have any
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
questions or if you even just want to
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
get coffee and talk about the veteran
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
landscape in New Hampshire I'd be super
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
happy to do that so thank you so much
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
thank you a wonderful presentation and
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful handouts um I'm sure there's a
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
couple of questions probably percolating
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
but um Brent Fraser is here too um Brent
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
did you want to uh come up and um sir I
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
think um for Mr chair thank you uh for
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and it's it's great to be
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
here I think after both of what Justin
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
and Amy provided uh I would just like to
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
express on behalf of the Department of
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
wholehearted support uh to the the va's
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
whole of nation uh Health uh benefits
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
program as well as what Amy described in
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
terms of New Hampshire's uh Suicide
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
Prevention programs particularly the uh
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
the military and Veterans programs the
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
veteran services is a partner with both
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh they've outlined the programs and
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
while I think probably most of you all
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
are aware there's a little over 94,000
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
veterans across the state of New
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most are doing very well uh
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
they've got good jobs they've got the
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities they own their
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
own homes but if you look uh a level
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
below that if you look at the suicide
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
numbers across the state of New
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and really if you you peeled
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
back what Justin uh alluded to in terms
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the national numbers uh the numbers
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
for veteran suicide both Across the
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
Nation and in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
are nowhere near where they should be
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
one is too many and we have uh well over
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
one in the state of New Hampshire as Amy
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned our numbers are coming down
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh from uh 2020 20 to
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
2021 uh the 2020 new number 22 numbers
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
are still pending uh and so we will see
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
where those go uh but I think they very
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
eloquently described the programs and
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
initiatives that are getting after the
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
problem uh and we would just support
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
those problem uh those uh programs and
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh going forward so I'm here
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh in support and subject to any
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have uh for our
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
department uh to be able to provide
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
reinforcing fires to to what they shared
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
all thank you so much Bren
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
um questions for uh represent Carrie if
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
you want Mr chairman if you don't
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
mind there's always one more thing um
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things I wanted to add was
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the initiatives that came about
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
in about the last year or so for the VA
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
is the compact act and I think it's very
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
important that folks know about that um
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation that came out pretty
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
much in the last year so allows for
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
emergency Psychiatric Services to be
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
paid for by the VA for most veterans who
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
are other than dishonorably discharged
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh which is a tremendous expansion of
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
services to Veterans um there are some
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
specifics as far as eligibility is
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
concerned um but it provides 30 days of
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
residential care and 90 days of
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Care uh for a total of 12 120
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
days for somebody who's in that crisis
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
situation that also includes if an
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance ride is needed to get to the
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
ER and it doesn't have to be a VA
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
facility it's it's wherever the veteran
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
wants to go or whatever the local
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
whatever the nearest support is um
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's some other eligibility issues
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's a reserve or garden
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
how long they've been active for uh but
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know sort of
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
those details can get sorted out with
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
the case managers and the um folks that
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
manage that but I think it's it
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
important that folks know about that
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
available thank you for that Justin um
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative Carrie yes uh can you
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
tell me how
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
veterans whether active or or out of
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
service get this information that we've
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
gotten today how is H how do they know
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
to act access service do you you know as
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
they're signing out say oh by the way
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
here's a little pamphlet for you how do
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
they get this
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
information you just described one of
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
the challenges that I think those of us
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
sorry in the veteran
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
services World struggle with is getting
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
that information out there uh while it
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to every situation what is
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
common is when you've got somebody who's
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the service transitions in care
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
transitions from um life transitions are
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
um known to be risky situations for for
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh veterans um when somebody's leaving
 
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.190 align:start position:0%
uh veterans um when somebody's leaving
active

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
duty they're focused on housing they're
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
focused on getting a job they're focused
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
on doing a lot of
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
things and many times but not always
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
there is you know it's later on that the
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
person starts thinking hey I need I need
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
to connect with the VA that person may
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
have gotten the information about what
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
to do when they got out of the service
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
but they might not have been ready to
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
hear it so
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're every veteran service organization
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
that I've encountered in New Hampshire
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
has been eager to get the word out to um
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know things like event calendars and
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh sort of getting the word out these
 
00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
are things that it's it's definitely a
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
challenge we talk I talk about it with
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
the coalitions that we've built how do
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
we get the word out how do we connect
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
with veterans in the community and it's
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
not easy uh but it doesn't mean we're
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
just going to stop we keep doing doing
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
it uh I know the the va's got social
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
media presence many of our Coalition few
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
of our coalitions have uh just try in
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
different ways uh to connect but I I I
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question because it is
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
probably one of the biggest challenges
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
right follow up follow up one of the um
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
the questions that was asked of me was
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
that is there any way since it seems
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
like every veteran regardless of their
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
personal situation has a phone is there
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
any way you can text links to services
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
or that sort of information via their
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
phone so that they have it with them
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
whenever it is that they need it one of
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
the things I did want to add from your
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
previous question then I'll get to that
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the VA does have social workers
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
working in the mil and the milit in the
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
military to VA program it's a
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
transitional program social workers
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
whose job is is to help veterans
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
transition uh from their care and and
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
Military medical support to the VA but
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
again the challenge is we have to
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
identify the veterans um we have to get
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
the word out that's where the the New
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire asked the question campaign is
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
really wonderful uh and it's um just
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
there uh a comment for you all um I just
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
had a note or mention from my researcher
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
there is a Health and Human Services
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh oversight committee um it's chaired
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
by representative Mark Pearson I'm not
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
sure if you've had any interaction with
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
that committee with Mark but but I would
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
recommend if that you make a note uh
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
Mark Mark Pearson is a state
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative he's actually used to be
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
with Health and Human Services committee
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
he now chairs the child and family law
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
Committee in fact he he and I he and US
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
share that office right there um so uh
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
mark would be in his over oversight
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee would I think be a wonderful
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh potential uh resource to interface
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
with so uh would encourage you to reach
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
out and disconnect with with
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson his son's in the
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature too this is Mark the the
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
father uh
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
inter yeah the son right Steve is is the
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
Son and Mark is the is with the uh
 
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.829 align:start position:0%
Son and Mark is the is with the uh
oversight

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh anything else other
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
mow you were mentioning that you have
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
eight coalitions throughout the state do
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
notch the the furthest up that uh we've
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
been able to organize folks is Conway
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
which is Carol County and then we have
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the central region in Plymouth um
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
there are some challenges when it comes
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
to catchment areas when you get above
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the knot that's White River
 
00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.030 align:start position:0%
the knot that's White River
Junction

00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Junction
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
um the um there's a lot of great
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
programs up there we've reached out one
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that is uh really been
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
great as I've learned about New
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Amy mentioned the Grassroots
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
efforts around the state uh there's a
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
lot of great folks out there that are
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
working on these things there's some
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
really great supports already existing
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
up in um the North Country uh but we do
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
not yet have a coalition there but we're
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
also not done building coalitions either
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
so possibly in the future hope so well
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
if I can help you let me know okay thank
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Mass is from
 
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
Littleton which is just barely in the
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
North Country some people argue if it is
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
or it isn't I'm from gron originally
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
Country um anything else I represent uh
 
00:45:55.559 --> 00:45:58.109 align:start position:0%
Country um anything else I represent uh
sh

00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you all for being here today
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
um just my own story I served in Vietnam
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
and carried a lot of baggage back with
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
that and I had the bright idea that if I
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
went back to Vietnam to see it the way
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
it is I'd stop remembering how it was
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
when I was there and I went back seven
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and of course the Luck of the
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
Irish I arrived and it was the iners
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the unification of the north and
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
south and everywhere I looked there was
 
00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
a picture of hoi men looking down
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
smiling on me and um I was supposed to
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
be there 10 days but I had to leave
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
after 8 cuz places that I went to where
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
I knew things happen especially during
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
tat was now in Nestle's or Michelin or
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
some Corporation was there and um I came
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
back and saw our counselor and she was a
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful person but it was like I was
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
talking a foreign language when I try to
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
explain things like you know what
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
different phrases and things meant and
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
she didn't seem to understand and I
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
think there is something you know we
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
talk about um functional alcoholics I
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
think there's a thing called functional
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
people with some form of mental health
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
that do have college degrees are working
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
in professions but in part of my concern
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
about going to VA was I felt there was a
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
stigma a stigma attached to that and so
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
but this person I saw I saw her about
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
four or five times and she was terrific
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
but she had no idea in a way and I think
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
it was probably because more me than it
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
was her so I eventually went to VA and
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
that was the best thing I did cuz there
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
everything that I was afraid about VA or
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
heard about it was just the opposite and
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
once a year now I get a call from the
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
doctor saying how's things going you're
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay and you know and they always
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
reaching out and so so like I think
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we think it's the lower
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
economic segment of our communities that
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
struggle but it can be anybody at any
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
time and um and uh and if you're a
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
September representative Shir lfty um
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service and I
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
think are there other veterans on this
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you as well just wanted
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
to recognize that again we're talking
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
about the ask the question campaign I
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
figure it makes sense we should do it
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
here um but um and listening to your
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
story I really appreciate that one of
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
the things that we've been doing in the
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
military and veterans committee is
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
really looking to promote military
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
culture training um it's a little bit
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
more than just understanding rates and
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
ranks and branches of the military it's
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
understanding a little bit more about
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
how Soldiers and Sailors and Airmen
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
think and behave and act and things that
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
they expect and
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
um when a clinician has taken that extra
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
step to try and understand that culture
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
better veterans can feel that if that
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense uh and that's important uh
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we look to uh
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
continue to spread that training around
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
the community one of the initiatives
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
with the Lakes Region Veterans Coalition
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
is they've put together a training of
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention military culture and
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh selfcare and they've been presenting
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
that to the Lakes Region Community
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
College EMT program they're expanding
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
that to the the nursing program there as
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
well um
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
and these are folks that are entering
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
the field who are going to be taking
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
care of folks in the community um and
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know ideally these folks have a leg
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
up to be able to address some of the
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
identified R did you a hand up
 
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.390 align:start position:0%
identified R did you a hand up
y

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
y
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh listening to representative
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
shirtliff we had discussions on that I
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
was in a Navy during the Vietnam era I
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
never served in combat I never got into
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
a fight except with other
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
Shipmates now when I get out of of the
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
military I went to work was a police
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
officer in Manchester for a time as a
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
matter of fact representative sheriff
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
and I were we were to the academy
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
together back then in
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
1970 I did go through an anti-war
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
demonstration which uh
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
which kind of messed me up a little bit
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
not suicidal I never thought of being
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
suicidal but there was only four of us
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
against around 250 and I thought my life
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
was over and I had something clicked
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
inside my head and I remember thinking
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
to myself it was either I had a pucker
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
Factor if you can be gross either fight
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
or flight something clicked in my head I
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
I said if I'm going down today
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's coming with me and I started
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
lashing back and I was
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
we were all pretty effective until the
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the uh cops showed up thank God
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
and not everyone who were demonstrating
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to get involved in the fight but
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
there were some in there who every time
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
you tried to make an arrest you get
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
pounded in the back so you let the
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
person go they were hoping that you'd go
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
into the crowd then you would me and I
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
remember I couldn't shut it down that
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
night when it was all over and went back
 
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
you know you you need okay gagy go back
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
to your rout and I I asked the captain I
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
says Captain I say I need to go home
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
says why you're police officer you go
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
out there and do your job I says I don't
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
feel right I you know I couldn't put it
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
into words you know you're a police
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
officer man up keep that to yourself go
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
out there and finish your roof well I
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
ended up shooting somebody that night
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
because they were getting away and
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
another one who not going to get away
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
that absolutely representative shirtliff
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
knows about this story
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely Ru ruined my career as a
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
police officer because I didn't want to
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
and I got over that but I had I had uh
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
flashbacks for about oh a year and a
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
half two years after that I would
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
yelling at the bullet to come back into
 
00:52:14.839 --> 00:52:15.589 align:start position:0%
yelling at the bullet to come back into
the

00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
gun literally yelling and I'd wake up
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
and and my wife would say what's the
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
matter I said I had that dream again
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
I'll crying out loud right the
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing was in my estimation that they did
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
not have someone there who could talk
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
you down and calm you down and but by
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
goly sends you home to rest up because I
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't click off I I was looking for
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
trouble I was looking to get
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody and and they couldn't
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
apparently they couldn't get that
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
through their head I can't identify with
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
some Soldier Marine anybody who's been
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
in combat
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
so there's no way that I could uh
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
counsel with them because I wasn't there
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
I didn't know any of that stuff but I
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
was there when I was getting hit and I
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
was hidden back and I wasn't going to
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
survive that's how I felt and if
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that night would have a captain
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
would have said yeah go home Larry and
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
you know think it over and just relax
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you know give me a call come and see
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%

to introduce it we'll call this hearing
to

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
order uh and Rec the chair
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes um the Speaker of the House
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
Representative uh from lonary
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Packard on uh s SP 317
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
great number 317 thank you Mr Speaker uh
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
well than thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Senator
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
Bradley couldn't be here today so he
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
asked me to introduce it for him and um
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
even though I am a sponsor of it and I
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
knew what it said I just R actually read
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
it today you know from top to bottom so
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically it sets up a New Hampshire
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
Ireland Trade
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
Commission and um I'm not going to go
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
through everything in the bill but um I
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
know I think we're the sixth largest
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
partner trading partner to is land and I
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
think you've all met or most of you
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
might have met Sergeant Mark I mean uh
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Mark
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
Daly and um you know he's been over here
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
and he called me Friday afternoon on my
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
way home and said can do you want me to
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
fly over for today's hearing I said
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
Senator I said it might last 15 20
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
minutes he says I don't care I'll be
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
over if you figure you need me so I I
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
told the senator I said I don't want you
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
flying from Ireland for a 10-minute
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
meeting but
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to that's fine but uh he
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
he didn't decided not to do it so this
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
basically sets up a trade Council so we
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
can work uh closer with our our Ireland
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh trade partners and uh I I don't I
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't see anything but good coming out
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
of it um it's about all I
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
got I mean it's it's um it's fairly
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated I hate to after being as
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
many years in this institution say that
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill but I truly do
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
believe this is a uh fairly simple
 
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.029 align:start position:0%
believe this is a uh fairly simple
straightforward

01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
Bill and with that I'll try and answer
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have Mr
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
chairman or members uh thank you Mr
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
Speaker I was going to ask you if you
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
would take any questions are there any
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Packard
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Massa
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
MIP thank you Mr uh speaker I was just
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
wondering what precipitated this bill
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
now I think the the fact that
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
um um we we seem to have established a
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
much closer
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
relationship uh I was over there in 22
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
with ncsl one of the trips over there
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
and uh we spent three days with uh you
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
know Senator Daly you know when we were
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
over there and we started talking about
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing you know as far as
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
he'd like to set up a trade Council and
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
almost all the States you know all the
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
United States and each individual State
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
So that obviously we could um work
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
closer together but I think that we are
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit closer than some of the
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
other states seeing that um if you're if
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
you look at it it uh the the first
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
settlement was uh in nutfield which is
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
now part of my hometown netfield used to
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
Encompass London Derry parts of daily
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
parts of Manchester parts of Windham
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
until it was broken up
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
so there is a little bit of discussion
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether it was dairy or London
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
Dairy where the first potato was grown I
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
there thank you for that Mr
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker I uh read I also read the
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
measure and I saw the town of nutfield
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
and I thought I knew where every town
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
was in New hampsh sure but nutfield uh I
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
did not know until now uh the uh
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
technically it doesn't exist anymore
 
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.470 align:start position:0%
technically it doesn't exist anymore
nutfield

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
nutfield
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh there have been uh I I see the
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
measure calls for two representatives to
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
be in the trade Council there are a
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
number of volunteers who've already
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
stepped up to uh to uh fill that role uh
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
we can get you those names uh down the
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
road uh other questions go ahead M I've
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
I've had numerous requests that be on
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
the trade counsel yes not everybody
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
wants to be on a commission or a
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
committee but this one seems to call to
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh some of our
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%

thank

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you OB sherff I was going to
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
point out that we are one shy of Corum
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
we had a request in yesterday to uh to
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the office and uh with the powers vested
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the speaker I'm sure that uh that
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
that would work if you well we were just
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
talking about that over in the office
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
because I was under the impression you

were down too so we were just talking
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
about that so I I would give give me a
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes to make sure that um
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't already filled
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
it uh absolutely uh we will uh if
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
there's no other questions and no one no
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh did you give us a pink card Mr
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker we'll we'll fill it out we'll
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
fill it out for you representative
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
KY uh what opportunities do you see for
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
this trade Council in terms of improving
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
or expanding relationships with Ireland
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
well I I think uh you know our goal is
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh after um you know we spent when we
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
were when I was over there with uh the
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
ncsl delegation in uh 22 um we did talk
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
about the number of businesses that are
 
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
about the number of businesses that are
already

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
involved uh you know between our two
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
countries and um uh we hoping our you
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
know our hope is that this will
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
expand you know the cooperation between
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
our two countries and thus actually
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh increase the companies that
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
are doing a lot of trade with Ireland
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
and you know hire more people and uh and
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
versa anything
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
else representative Sebert hi thank you
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Speaker um I
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
was just curious and it could just be me
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
but I was just wondering when I looked
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
at it online on the docket thing was
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
there an FN attached to this like a fun
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
thing or is that there anymore if you if
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
you look at the back uh it it it does
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and um as so many of
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
the bills that um we get uh this is
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at this time and it's
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
going to be um uh you know something
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's self-funded it's doesn't look
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
like it's going to require any state
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
funding okay all right thank you pres
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
Sheriff yeah just to follow up on that
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
question I think it's very comparable to
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
the Canadian American Trade Council
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
which Linda and I both belong to and I
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
think their funding is like $8,000 a
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
year that goes to the Secretary of State
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
to fund that and so I'm sure this would
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
be comparable and so when this bill came
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the floor it wouldn't have to go to
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
finances the second committee because
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
the funding amount is so small and and
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
and it is as the back says now it's
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
still indeterminable Yes you well know
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker you went you and I went
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
through most of all the bills and how
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
many came up in determinable or the
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal no he turned into the uh clerk's
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
office when it's ready than not yeah
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.910 align:start position:0%
office when it's ready than not yeah
yeah

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh there's a good question rep seber the
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
the word indeterminable I've seen many
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
times uh not as many as I have Mr
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker if there are no further
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
questions Mr Speaker uh if you can help

your motion well I think as the bill
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
mentions there's a great history between
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
the United States and Ireland um you
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
know the towns were settled from people
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Northern Ireland and der Lyon der
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
in that area uh one of our Governors and
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
Civil War Revolutionary War General John
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
Sullivan was the son of immigrants from
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
County Cork Ireland the fact that here
 
01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire during the Great Irish
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
famine which really wasn't a famine
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
because grain was being shipped out of
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
Ireland it was the Shakers in New
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that sent food to the Irish
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
during that period and um I think like I
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
said that long con connection uh in the
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
fact that my own mother came here from
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
Ireland as a little girl uh before the
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
trouble started in Ireland because her
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
father was involved in the Irish
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
Republican Brotherhood and
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's it's great that
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
we are finally doing this and I commend
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%

01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation before this committee
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%

01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
also from County Cork my dad's family is

questions um yes represent Lloyd just
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
for my own curiosity just so I can learn

a little a little bit um the uh 400
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
million in Granite State Goods uh sent

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
like the question is what goods do we
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
send is part of the trade relationship
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
what goods do we send uh
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
to uh Ireland I know representative
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
Pearl honeymoon there and I'm sure the
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
when I was there and I'm sorry can't
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
remember that that is a very good
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
relevant question given the nature of
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the measure and uh we will uh we'll find
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%

much committee this year so so I have a
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question before we all
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
leave should we not put this on consent
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh Mr Speaker representative
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
KY makes a interesting point in question
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh as with the Taiwan resolution which
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
we did pull off consent so that we could
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that briefly in the floor uh do
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
you see any utility in in uh not putting
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
this on consent so that someone can
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
speak to it on the floor what is your
 
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
speak to it on the floor what is your
sense

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
