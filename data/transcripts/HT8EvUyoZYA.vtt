uh before we kick things off though um I
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
would ask representative McKay as our
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
senior member if you could maybe lead us
 
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
pledge I pledge allegiance to the flag
 
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 align:start position:0%

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
the Republic stand one nation under God
 
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKay so um
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
so one older them
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
well well but you you're you're
 
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
certainly top dog here so um so anyways
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
what I want to do is I kind of want to
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
get right into this um the we had the
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh hearings earlier in the spring with
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
respect to S sp495 which was looking to
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
bring in some certification um on uh
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
addiction treatment
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
facilities there was some concern in the
 
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole as to uh the
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
breadth you know of of the the scope of
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
it U maybe is it so broad that it's
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to maybe deter some people from
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
coming into uh uh the treatment sphere
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
and and is it what exactly are the needs
 
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to fulfill so we can
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that um we're actually
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
covering those things and the committee
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
was not comfortable I don't think with
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
going forward with the legislation as it
 
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 align:start position:0%
was there were still some gaps in
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
understanding there but definitely uh we
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
we took away the impression uh from from
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
the the testimony that the need was
 
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
there and it was legitimate and it would
 
00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 align:start position:0%
need to have some legitimate followup so
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
um so here and I'm going to be chairing
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
the committee and uh just to quickly go
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
over our roles representative shipiro
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
has graciously offered to to step in and
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
to to help out as our clerk um I really
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't have any experience in in in the
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
treatment sphere I make light bulbs
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's my job um and that's it so but
 
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have some folks
 
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee um who do have uh
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
counseling experience and representative
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
we also has a significant amount of
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
legislative experience as does
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
representative McKay so I think you know
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
between everybody that we have at the
 
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
table and with the input that you guys
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
are going to offer us hopefully we can
 
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 align:start position:0%
kind of you know better understand what
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
the need is make sure that everything is
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
matching up and uh we're going to go
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
forward with something really good my
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
goal at the end of today is just to have
 
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what the why is and
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
what our scope is going to be and what
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
information we're going to need to
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
gather over the summer um unfortunately
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher is not here
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
she's out today um but I will take the
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
notes from today I'll I'll followup
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
meeting with her so that she can kind of
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
get going and Gathering stuff um so that
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're not kind of caught flat footed in
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
September when we all come back okay so
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I think what I
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
want to do is get right into it in terms
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
of helping us to define the scope so I'd
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
like to start uh uh
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Barry if you if You' like to come
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
forward and just quickly give us a quick
 
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
refresher um on what the why is so we
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit in the initial uh
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
public hearing about you know the
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
podcast at 13 steps but you know more
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
more broadly speaking what are we
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
talking about what what is the need and
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and I was just going to ask if if
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
as you're walking us through this you
 
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:03.629 align:start position:0%
as you're walking us through this you
will

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
get my eye yeah and I'll just clarify
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
that because the three versions that we
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
have we have um the the version that
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
came over from us from the Senate um
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
then we have your marked up version uh
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
Mr Barry and then uh representative King
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh gave us uh some recommendations from
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh an organization that he works which
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
is the Addiction
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
Counseling I forget the name of the
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
organization addiction recovery
 
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
Coalition oh the yes that's right the
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
addiction recovery Coalition so they had
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it was very slight differences so
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
those are kind of the the three versions
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
that we have up here so representative
 
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
we's points well
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
made okay uh good morning I think I know
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
organization that has been working for
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
more than 25 years in the substance
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
misuse space so thank you for your time
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
and attention to this important matter
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
um I I I do want to uh introduce my
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues over here U Jamie powers and
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
nette Escalante from uh from Gate House
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
treatment from Elliott Health Systems uh
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
respectively and then uh Sarah Cleveland
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
from the Department who have all played
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
a key role in developing this uh this
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
legislation um as you mentioned
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative there were uh New
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Radio released a 13
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
step podcast a little bit more than a
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
year ago now it uh detailed a pattern
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
and culture of um sexual assault and
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
harassment within one of our larger
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
treatment networks in the State uh as
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
part of that reporting uh it not only
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
went over that particular treatment
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
network but it exposed what many of us
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
had known for a long time to be a lack
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
of oversight of other parts of the
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
treatment Network as well or the Tre or
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
the treatment system broadly uh
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
specifically over
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
the over the summer and and the the fall
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
last year uh we really pinpointed uh a
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
specific res sorry Outpatient Treatment
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
where there is absolutely no uh no real
 
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
oversight mechanism by the state uh
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities like
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
many of the uh uh the ones highlighted
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the podcast are licensed by the
 
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
department but when it comes to
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
outpatient treatment uh there there
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
again this state in many cases has no
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
record of uh the treatment providers has
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
no idea who they are where they operate
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
and specifically cannot track uh the
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
quality of services that they provide uh
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
I I I think if you were to talk to Miss
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
Powers and Miss Escalante you would they
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
would tell you that this has been well
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
known for a long time that there has
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
been um reports uh frequently of or or
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
reports occasionally of people coming
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
from treatment that was not following
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
best practice that was not um you know
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
following proper uh uh provider patient
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
ratios that in some cases folks were not
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh who were employed who were uh
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
providing levels of treatment or support
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
who had not been in uh far enough along
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
in their own recovery to be able to
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
properly treat others uh you know there
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
there's a whole variety of sort of uh
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
best practices and standards that are
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
are um expected across the field but are
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
not uh we're not able to be tracked or
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
enforced by the state uh so that's what
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
we came together to really try to
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
address uh uh you know and that's what
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does it it is intended really
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh to focus only on in its current form
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
only on Outpatient Treatment uh it does
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
not does not cover residential it does
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
not cover 12ep programs which are not
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
considered clinical really is just
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
clinical Outpatient Treatment uh as far
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
as the version of that's something that
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you so much
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
for your support back in the the
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee process we did come up with an
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think uh better defined
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
the scope of what we were trying to do
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
that's been the version that I've been
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
going off of I haven't seen
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives amend representative
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
King's Amendment so I don't know what
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions they are suggesting we're
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to to look at them um
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
but you know really we want to Def
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
better Define the scope of this as as uh
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
outpatient clinical treatment only uh
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
not affecting AA not affecting other
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
12-step programs like that and again the
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
the idea is just to give uh the state uh
 
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959 align:start position:0%
you know to help the state better map
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
out who is providing Services uh you
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
know across our state uh and give them a
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
sort of mechanism to enfor to ensure
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
that best practices are being followed
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
and that uh the the uh patients in need
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
across our state are are being uh
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
protected and served in the way that um
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
the way they need and I would certainly
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
if you're open to it I would love to
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
have invite my colleagues to answer any
 
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.710 align:start position:0%
have invite my colleagues to answer any
questions

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
but yeah representative
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
Shapiro so
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
um number one question is um what is the
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
scope about patient services I mean I
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
assume that I assume that um is
 
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.670 align:start position:0%
assume that I assume that um is
one-on-one

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
one-on-one
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
counseling maybe intensive day treatment
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can elaborate on the
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
scope scope and um and my second
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
question because maybe you want to
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate your answer to both of them
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
is there was some discussion when at the
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
hearing of this bill about whether we
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
were talking about individual clinicians
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
or whether we're talking about buildings
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
sure and um my sense is that we're not
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking about either but we're talking
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
about programs yes correct so um maybe
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
just if you have any thoughts on both
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
either of those and if you don't I I'll
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
take the second part of the question
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
first yeah
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
so as you referenced representative
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
Shapiro uh individual practitioners are
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
individually are professionally licensed
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
by the by oplc and that's not what we're
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
trying to touch on here our concern is
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
that there are some programs or some
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
organizations around the state that
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
where this is really this kind of um
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
misconduct is embedded into the culture
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
and that if you are simply holding an
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
individual practitioner responsible that
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
that person may be removed they may lose
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
their license but they will be replaced
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
by somebody else who is going to be
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
pushed into following the same kind of
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
um questionable practice and leaving
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
patients exposed to the same kind of
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
potential wrongdoing um so this int so
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
the intention of this is to you know
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's not I don't want to say buildings
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
because this is not just looking at the
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
physical structure itself but it is
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
looking as you say at programs to ensure
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
that both you know certainly that uh the
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
physical structures following safety you
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
know proper Safety and Security
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines but also that they uh uh that
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
they their their practice their Pro the
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
programmatic elements of what they're
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
they doing are following best practice
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
and again offering patients the
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
protections and high level services that
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they need uh so yeah so again it is
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
intended not uh not to Target
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who are already licensed uh
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
not buildings per se U but programs um
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
the uh what as far as the the kind of
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
programs we're talking about here uh and
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm trying to find find it in
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment we do try to you know we
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
what we did uh in the amended version
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
that that representative Weber was
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
working on we looked at uh the as Asam
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
definitions of outpatient services Asam
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
is the American Society of addiction
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
medicine I hope I got that right um they
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
are the uh you know the
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
credentialing um sorry the credentialing
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
organization throughout the country they
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
are the ones who set definitions who set
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
the the tiers of service that uh um most
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
service providers across the country
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
follow so we took the uh their
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
definition and we uh wrote that into the
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm trying to find where
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't think
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think it's in the uh
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment we received but the the second
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
one it's in I I think the issue Mr chair
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that I'm sorry I think the issue is
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the amendment that I drafted was
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
never adopted because we went to interm
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
study so that amendment is not in the
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
system and what I was going to ask is
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
after this if Mr Barry would let me take
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
his copy and run down the hall with it
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
and get copies for all of us that might
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful because you don't have that
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
in front of you I do believe you have it
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
um so there's a a bunch of different
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
copies of the Amendments representative
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
Weber and he had actually sent over his
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'd had Karen make a copy
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
so we have the the the amendment as by
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate which we received
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
in but then there's the also the the
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
non-double spaced copy um of the
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
amendment which you have here should uh
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
have some highlighted okay I've got
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
something that's highlighted NOP that's
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's got the same so it looks the
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
same from the front but instead of being
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh right but if it was my Amendment it
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
would say it would not have an s on it
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
because okay these are the Senate
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
amendments here and I've got two copies
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
of the Senate
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh but I don't think I have
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
anything that would say representative
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
Weber in the corner which is an
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that I had drafted that
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that hadn't been but but Mr
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
Barry did send over a
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
copy um oh I see so so the one with the
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
highlighting yes which was one gave to
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
you is his photoc copy of it's on the
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
third page yeah so if you go in the
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
middle okay if you go to the one that
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
you you emailed to me
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
mrry and you go we're all working off
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
the same great but it's right and so
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
what what this lists out the amended
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
version and and again I'm happy to to
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
provide copies of that helpful it says
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
programs and Facilities required to be
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
certified shall include those providing
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
outpatient services as set forth by the
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
American Society of addiction medicine
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
including long-term remission monitoring
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Therapy medically managed
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
outpatient intensive outpatient
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
high-intensity outpatient partially
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
partial hospitalization and medically
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
managed intensive outpatient and again
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
those are the categories of outpatient
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
as defined by by Asam the the national
 
00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.829 align:start position:0%
as defined by by Asam the the national
credentialing

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
agency and you had a question
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so I'm I'm still
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around exactly
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of organizations that we're
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
talking about sure
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
so for example I know that we have a
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
robust p
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
support operation
 
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.070 align:start position:0%
support operation
in

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
Keen does this cover that or is that
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
again a horse of a different color that
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
so uh those peer supports are generally
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
housing at commun recovery Community
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
organizations or recovery centers that
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
this is that is not covered here that is
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
not that is not clinical treatment that
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
is and so that is not so if I may as a
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
followup is is that so it's not clinical
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
treatment so it doesn't need need to be
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
regulated or it's already regulated by
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
DH it's they they're already uh there
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
are contracts in place with each of the
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
individual recovery Community
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
organizations so that that already
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
exists elsewhere okay great thank you
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
that helps me great deal representative
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
chairman 65 years ago when I came to New
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I came as director of
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and in those days we had
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
outpatient clinics and a
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
hospital and uh it's been fascinating to
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
me after all of those years and being in
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
private practice to
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
recognize 65 years later that there's
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
just as much
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
confusion and uh lack of clarity as to
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
where alcoholism treatment really
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
belongs um
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
I have a nephew who's in AA and he is
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely totally against any other
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
kind of treatment and I think AA does
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
that routinely um the
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
um the the thing that has concerned me
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
over the years is that it's never been
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
clear as to what
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what organization our structure
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
it belongs to I've always thought it was
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
a mental health problem and that people
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
who become seriously addicted to do so
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
because of a mental health problem uh
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
many people would think I was crazy to
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
say a thing like that that alcoholism is
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
an addiction and anybody can become
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
addicted so what we're taking on is a
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
very very
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
longstanding problem in this state as to
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
how to Define alcoholism
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
addiction and does it belong under
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
forensic care because a lot of the
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
people with addictions end up in the
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
prison system and the County
 
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.590 align:start position:0%
prison system and the County
correctional

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
correctional
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
systems uh so that uh this is an
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
extremely broad subject uh
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so I think the intent of this
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is to put it under Health
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
Services and then somehow under
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health which is according to
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
me as mental health uh
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
systems and that would be a step in the
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
direction of saying that that's where it
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
belongs and and we shouldn't have this
 
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
belongs and and we shouldn't have this
huge

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
huge
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
variety there is massive misuse of
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
facilities where people are um allowed
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
to go um the sober houses all of those
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of things uh some of those are
 
00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.430 align:start position:0%
kinds of things uh some of those are
Highly

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
Highly
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
Questionable uh
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
and and that seem to be more oriented to
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
getting money than they are to
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
providing uh care
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
care and and providing what kind of care
 
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.390 align:start position:0%
care and and providing what kind of care
and

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
that that is a basic question for us as
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
to what care
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
means uh does it mean get them away from
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol drugs or does it mean to get to
 
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.029 align:start position:0%
alcohol drugs or does it mean to get to
the

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
underlying problem that creates the
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
condition in the first place and this
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
does this belong in public health or
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
mental health uh
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
systems uh so that this is uh certainly
 
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
systems uh so that this is uh certainly
extremely

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
important um uh subject uh that's been
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
around for a very long time uh and there
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
are many people who are
 
00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:22.269 align:start position:0%
are many people who are
suffering

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
significantly and not getting
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate care I tend to be on the
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
side of thinking that this is a forensic
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
mental health problem um that that is
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
not necessarily A a popular point of
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
view um but that with the new forensic
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
unit that's being developed at New
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital the question would be
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
is is that an appropriate facility to
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
take into
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
consideration uh but uh I've told you
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
the the age Factor as well if it's 65
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
years ago I I came here 65 years ago to
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
stay a year something happened well
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
sir um representative
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
Weber and I think that representative um
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
McKay's Point highlights the problems
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
that we had and are having with this
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
bill um his
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
approach is a global
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
one as
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the compreh the philosophy of the
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive treatment of
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
addiction and what we have in front of
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
us is a very very small piece of that
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
puzzle and the bill that we have in
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
front of us is
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
devoted uh with this amendment solely
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
and clearly to outpatient
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
services uh rather than anything else
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
and so I think Mr chairman as you have
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
already pointed out one of the things
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
one of the tasks of this
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee is to First Define the scope
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to look at um
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
because uh there there are broader and
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
narrower ways to go about this and and
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is very narrow uh
 
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is very narrow uh
whereas

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
um my thought would be just my own
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
personal opinion would be that if we are
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
to undertake a broader
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
study of the
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
entire scope of how we address addiction
 
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
issues which might not be a bad thing to
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
do I think that requires a much larger
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
commission with much broader
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
participation than we have here uh
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
because this is a very limited sampling
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
of of as as much knowledge as I see to
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
the right of me um I'm well aware of my
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
own woeful ignorance and um I I have
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
some experience in the regulatory
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
aspects but not the clinical aspects but
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
I I think perhaps as a as a beginning we
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
ought to decide as a committee whether
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the smaller
 
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.549 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the smaller
problem

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
which uh would be simpler um or the
 
00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:35.430 align:start position:0%
which uh would be simpler um or the
larger

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
larger
problem

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeso yes so um I am very very much in
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
favor um of dealing with the limited
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
narrow scope I'm not running again so I
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
won't be around to
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
for long enough to solve the large
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
problem um but regardless of whether we
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to stick to this
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill which or similar bill which um
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
provides oversight for just a you know a
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
narrow group of organizations I think it
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
might be helpful if we get U Miss Miss
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
Dyer to lay out the larger picture just
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
so we have it as we're doing this of all
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
the different kinds of substance misuse
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
programs and what kind of oversight they
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
have you know which are
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
you know how are residential programs
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
um um how do they get oversight um how
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
do individual clinicians through oplc I
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
mean I think these are some of the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
things that some of us know or at least
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
know parts of but it would be good to
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
have that broad picture in front of us
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
even as we don't address it okay
 
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
even as we don't address it okay
represent

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
Weber I think that would be a great
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
start uh it certainly would be helpful
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
for me um and the other thing that I'm
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
really hearing loud and clear here is
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we have this bill on the one hand
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
but we also have the sober houses issue
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh which is a whole which is now no
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
longer at all associated with this bill
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
um and as such I'm not sure that this
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is the appropriate place to
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
study that certainly the chair of our
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee could establish an ad hoc
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
committee on anything he he chooses to
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
establish one on but I think at some
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
point uh what we need to do is recognize
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Sober House issue and I can remember
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
that being addressed some years back in
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
the context of building codes and the
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire department being very
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
distressed at the conditions under which
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
people were living and the question of
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
whether they would be able to be safely
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
evacuated in the cour of an
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
emergency um but there are obviously
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
other issues as well that and I have not
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
listened to that program but am I right
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
to think that the podcast was about the
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
sober houses or was it about no okay I'm
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
seeing heads going the other way so okay
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to have that clarified too if I
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
may the um so we could perhaps leave
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
that issue also for another day uh there
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
was another bill we worked on last year
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
related to uh to recovery housing that
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
the that the house passed by Voice vote
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your support for that um
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
it did get uh caught up in the Senate
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
and that that hopefully will be coming
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
back that's all to say there uh there's
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
another sort of parallel conversation
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
going on about recovery housing that we
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with you want I'm
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
not that we considered that separate
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
from this bill okay I will note when
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
this bill began that it did Encompass
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment providers as well
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
what we discovered throughout the
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
process was that residential uh
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
facilities are licensed by the
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh while that primarily focuses on the
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
the physical plant it does cover some of
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
the clinical aspects that we uh that we
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
look to touch on here and with um those
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
that statute and those rules already
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
existing we thought that any adjustments
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
needed to be made by that was again a
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
separate and parallel process to trying
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
to establish this certification uh and
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
so so it got narrowed in in that way uh
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to uh create the wheel so
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
to speak for residential treatment
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
providers and make the department have
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
to license and certify the same
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
facilities so we thought that would be
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
redundant so we so that ultimately got
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh removed from the bill the scope was
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
narrowed a bit really to plug the whole
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the fill the Gap that exists and what
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
what I would argue um I I think that
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's a this is a part of the natural
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
maturation of our treatment Network I
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
think that uh you know thanks in parts
 
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the work that representative McKay
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
has done over the last 60 years thanks
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
very much to the uh Affordable Care Act
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
which required that uh uh insurance
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
coverage cover substance use Services
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
the uh treatment network has has
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
exploded so to speak in the last uh over
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
the last 10 12 years we have many more
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
providers doing this work than did
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
before and
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
um many of them just we don't again we
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't know who they are right we don't
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
know who they are we don't know what
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
quality of services they're provid so I
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
think that stepping in filling this Gap
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
and providing this level of oversight is
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
just it's a part of the maturation
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
process ensuring that all of our
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
providers are again meeting best
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
practice and are um serving patients the
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
way that that we need them
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
to a thank you for that so um I have a
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
couple of quick questions and then we
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
can kind of move on but before I do I
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
just want to say you have other folks
 
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
that are here as well so um we have we
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
do have space on where you can maybe
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
come up if you want um and and sit down
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
and if at any point you want to
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to the conversation you could
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
just kind of raise your hand rather than
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
kind of sitting there and and and
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
feeling like you can't participate if
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
you do want to come up um and there is
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
something as a discussion goes forward
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
that you feel you you know want to
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
contribute just raise a hand and and
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to to bring you into the
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
discussion so so with that being said on
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
the uh because I'm talking to the mayor
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
of Manchester he's saying with respect
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
to the sober homes it's it's still the
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
wild west but you're saying yes we know
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
that there is lure from the apartment
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
but there's a parallel Bill we really
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
got to put that aside because although
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing we we really want to
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
tailor this down so that's so what
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
you're saying is we're not ignoring the
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
problem um it's there but we're going to
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
kind of come back for a second bite at
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
the Apple as far as that goes yeah that
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
from where we're coming from that has
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
been a parallel uh discussion with with
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and again was uh sort
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
of separate legislation last year okay
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
um we would we would love to engage in
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
that as well and we'd love to welcome
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
you all to do so in any way but I I I
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
think this is a a a equally critical
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
issue to address okay and my second
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
question just quickly so you're talking
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
about what is uh not covered so
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
obviously individual clinicians are not
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
covered and that's explicitly pulled out
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
here in uh Roman 2 um and uh also um
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so 12-step programs things of that
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
nature so um is that what you're talking
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
to in in RSA 151 135 C colon 3 is that
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
getting how is
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
that the that that reference refers to
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers many of
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
which provide treatment but they they
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
are overseen by a whole host of federal
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
and state regulations already so we
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
thought we didn't want to add to that
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden okay so and maybe uh
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
so what explicitly in here exempts the
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
12-step programs then um because they
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.950 align:start position:0%
12-step programs then um because they
are

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
Exempted according to your testimony
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe the best approach is to do
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
what representative Shapiro said and
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
just you know come back with the Matrix
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
and just kind of work through it in
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
September representative Weber and and I
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
was going to ask and I we could ask Miss
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
Dyer but I wonder if we have between the
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
experts who are here people could who
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
could help us with this as well it would
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
be very helpful for me in addition to
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
the Matrix that we were talking about
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
which which I I very definitely need is
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
if somebody could give me a list of
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
existing programs not an exhaustive list
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be all of them but
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
just some examples in each County
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps of programs that would fall
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
under this so I can look at some
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
something on the ground and say aha
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about um and
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
and um so I I suspect that you folks
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
rather than Miss Dyer are the most
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate people to ask for that but
 
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.149 align:start position:0%
appropriate people to ask for that but
I'll

00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
defer hi can you guys hear me okay yes
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
um my name is Annette escante and I'm
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
the director for sud services at OT
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
health system and
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
um I think part of the issue is that we
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't know who's operating in
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
state and we would really love to be
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
able to not just figure out I mean right
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
now I could come in and just open up a
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
outpatient and I don't have to build
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid maybe I just don't take
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid maybe I just do Cash There's No
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
oversight and we have not been able to
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
identify who the players are in the
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
state and this is where it's it's a
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
crucial issue for the folks that were
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
serving because they don't know whether
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
they're a reputable organization or not
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
um and so that is probably one of the
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
bigger issues but you know the program
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
list is clinical people who are
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
providing under programs where you would
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
go and you would do group therapy
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
individual and you and there's multiple
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
clinicians that are in that facility but
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
I this has been an ongoing issue and a
 
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
I this has been an ongoing issue and a
problem

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
and although we've needed to have more
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
folks in the state for sud treatment we
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
have no idea who's operating here that's
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the problem and so it's getting these
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
folks certified and holding folks
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
accountable so that we don't have 30
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
people in one group and someone who has
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
a high school diploma who's running a
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
group and someone who is in another
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
building who's signing off on these
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
lists so I on the groups um and this is
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
and I should probably just State also
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
that prior to being the director at
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
Elliott um I also was the VP of farum
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
Center which is a Manchester's
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
residential and I was also previous just
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
like Jamie pow the director for the
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol services for
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS this has been an ongoing issue and
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
a problem and it's just getting worse
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
and so we just want oversight to make
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
sure that one the clients know who to
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
call if something goes wrong they don't
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
know who to call there's no regul
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
there's no legislation that if their
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
rights get violated they can't even hang
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything on the wall there's no phone
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
number and this is where it became a
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
huge issue or a problem and so I'm happy
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
to do what I can um I've been pushing
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
this from the beginning since I left um
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS and knew that my voice would count
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
out here I could do more um which is
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
what I've been doing and my disclaimer
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
is also that I also sit on the board of
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
new futures and also on the governor's
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
commission for Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
um that's part of the treatment um part
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
but um so that's really in a nutshell
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
how all of this started was the multiple
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
complaints from clients and I think we
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
can do better which is why I've been
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
pushing this um if I had a family member
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
who wanted to get treatment in New
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they could just call get
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
online Google anything um and that
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we know who they are
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
how they're operating so um I just
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I that I did
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
state that so I appreciate your time
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and and so and to just
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
clarify as well the goal the intention
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
here is to kind of map the landscape yes
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
and to basically inforce best practice
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
but in terms of you know people
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
requiring Medicaid this is not nothing
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
to do with regulations around payment or
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that correct I just want
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
no just for Clinical Services okay if I
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
could add very quickly represent to
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question represent I believe
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm getting my numbers right I think
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
the DHHS has stated that there I believe
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
are 73 providers in the state who take
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so they so I'm sure that they
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
could provide a list of folks who take
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid of those I believe this
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
department Sor you can correct me I
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
think the department contracts with nine
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
is that well there's approximately 73
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
providers in the state that are
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
contracted with Medicaid that does
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
include residential providers that does
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
incl okay out patient it fluctuates it's
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
depending on if there somebody is
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid or not um it's
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
around 65 that is umbrella organizations
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's not individual sites that may be
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
owned by one
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
organization um and again that was from
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
65 is list that was pulled back in I
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
think January so it may have fluctuated
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
since then their providers coming in
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
their providers
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
closing um but
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I've lost my train of thought right
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
now but uh yeah the total system is 73
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
and the department contracts with 10
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
facilities um some of them provide
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
outpatients some of them provide
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
residentials some of them provide both
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we have oversight of those 10
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and then Medicaid has Med has
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
oversight of Medicaid clients within the
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system but they do not have
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
oversight over non-medicaid clients or
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
anyone who isn't contracted with
 
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.510 align:start position:0%
anyone who isn't contracted with
Medicaid

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
oh and I was just if you wanted a quick
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
10,000 foot view of the treatment system
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire I could give that
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
now representative
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you very much for your
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
comments that they uh they point out a
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
symptom of what's the matter um and that
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
is that people are not clear as to what
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
is treatment for addiction and therefore
 
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
is treatment for addiction and therefore
the

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
general population are saying well if
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
these homes are they for treatment of
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
course they're not uh serving that
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
purpose so I think it's a a what you
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
point out is a symptom of a very large
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
problem we have in the state and that is
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
Define uh for the general public to
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
understand the causes of
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
addiction uh and and what is proper
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
treatment because I think people are
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
being treated in quotes uh in in ways
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
that that have nothing to do with
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
overcoming the problem uh so I think
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's important that we get this position
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
but that it's important who fills that
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
position and what their background is uh
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
because there are many
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
fields that there's mental health
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's addiction there's forensic work
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's there's people all over the
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
place who are experts in Cor in the
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
treatment of addictions but they don't
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
agree and so that what we're taking on
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
is a massive responsibility to be saying
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps we need to be
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
saying these are the root causes and and
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is the approach to treatment that
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
people should
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
seek that's a very large
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
prescription representative we I was
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask if just as a followup to
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
the frer comments you said there was a
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
list and there were this 73 providers
 
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
that take Medicaid some of them are
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
residential is there a way of getting up
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
us uh a copy of the list of
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
providers with the residential programs
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
taken out just so we could look at that
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
as a start Absolut something that we
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
could just just to give us a a grounding
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I I myself would love it uh Mr
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
chairman either at this meeting or
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps another meeting if it's more
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'd love to hear the 10,000
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
fo version so at some point yeah when
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
appr Jamie Powers I am the CEO at Gate
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
House treatment and I I think to uh
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative McKay's point is we're
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
not so much trying to dictate the
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
philosophy to but to make sure that
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatever philosophy whether your your
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy is 12 step based or
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
medication or forensic or whatever it is
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
that certain basic best practices are
 
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
that certain basic best practices are
being

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
followed so that whatever philosophy you
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
come from you are providing treatment in
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
a manner that is safe and high quality
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
treatment representative
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yeah
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
um this is directed um to Mr Barry
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
mostly I wonder if in terms
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
of in Terms terms of establishing what
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
this um Bill does exempts I wonder if it
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
might make sense to have a definition of
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
Clinical Services and the
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
definitions um and if that would
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
um that if that would make it more clear
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
um about what is included and what is
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
excluded from these kinds of
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
certifications I think that's something
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
we can certainly look at I think we can
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
also have a
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
a a stated exemption for for 12ep peer
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
support program explicitly yes I think
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's something we could certainly work
 
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:20.710 align:start position:0%
that's something we could certainly work
out

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
sure so I think we have some while we
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what we're in
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
covering I I think we're starting to get
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
a handle for what we want to Encompass
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
within the scope um at just a question
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
of going through and how is it going to
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
be defined in as explicit a manner as
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
possible so I think we have some actions
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to that some of the
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions um that were asked of me were
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
and I think we kind of touched on a
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
little bit is are the rules already in
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
place and can't we just enforce those
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
and I think the the argument is we can't
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't know where people are
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
so I think first we have to have so the
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
biggest argument for C certification is
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
we have to have the mapping so without
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
the mapping it makes it very hard to go
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
forth and just we have the rules in
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
place because there was a provision I
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
believe within the bill for an
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
edsman um and so the some might argue
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
okay you have you have rules um why not
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
just have rules and allow the edsman to
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
basically if people are receiving
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
services and they are not those are not
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the rules let the
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman kind of clean that up and so
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
the the reason that that would not be is
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
just I guess you have thoughts on that
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
sure so I can tell you the the second
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
piece of the bill related to the
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman was so as amended by the
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
Senate it would add a behavioral health
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
specialist position to the office of the
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
uzman within DHHS the intention of that
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that there is a line of
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
reporting in place that is properly
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
trained and equipped uh uh to handle
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
complaints of misconduct or wrongdoing
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
within the system there is currently uh
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
an office of the udman within DHHS that
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
covers all
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
DHHS all programs and services across
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
the board um I think despite that um
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
there exists and again I'm sure my
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues can speak to this more
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
directly than I can there exists a
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
culture of Silence in which people are
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
not reporting the wrongdoing that they
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
are experiencing they are seeing that
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
applies to the patients that applies to
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
the staff and we want to make sure that
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
there are people who are properly
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
trained and equipped to handle
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
complaints of misconduct or wrongdoing
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
specifically within the behavioral
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
health space that's that's the intention
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
of it um uh it is somewhat separate from
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
the certification requirement but but we
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're under no illusions that
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
even should certification be in place
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's still is the risk of wrongdoing
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
or misconduct and we just want to make
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure that there are uh places that
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
people can go to to report it when they
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
it and thank you for that so um could I
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
ask a clarification yes you may I'm just
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
recalling having the scene somewhere in
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
one of the versions I read that uh it
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be the office the
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
certification tell me as it as it is now
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
standing who does the certifying was
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
that in the office of the udman or the
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
office of udman are the people who who
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
are the people you comp obviously the
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
people you complain to and you want to
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
have the appropriately trained person to
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
deal with that but how do remind me
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
about the certification sure to begin
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
with so the the udman is simply for the
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
complaint side for people to fire
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
complaints we had um the uh
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
certification uh Pro program would be
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember if we it
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
explicitly St I I think the intention is
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
to put it in then under Bas Bureau of
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol Services um but we did
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know the way that we crafted the
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
legislation it left it to the
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner to develop rules around
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
this so I suppose ultimately it would be
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
up to them where they would like to
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
located but I but I assume the intention
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
desk just before we go on I I did have
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
um the the questions from representative
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
King it don't have his Amendment but
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much it basically um dovetails in
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
very closely with yours except that in
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
Roman one where your Amendment says the
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall provide for
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
scientific uh the scientific care he
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
just changes that to uh to provide for
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care um and uh he as well
 
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
is referencing Asam so basically taking
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
that language verbatim but he's saying
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh he's keeping in the language but not
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
limited to those providing our patient
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
services I think that um I think we are
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much in agreement that we want to
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
say yes that's too broad a statement
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah to say yeah but um and we had
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
struck that in the so we had Struck it
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I think so if we go with that he's
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
looking at what's it so I guess not
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
knowing anything what's the difference
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
between the scientific care and the
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care is there something
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's different about that terminology
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
I would leave that to other St and I
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
just want to note that that line that's
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
existing statutory language where it say
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
scientific we didn't didn't touch that
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
in any way um but I would leave others
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
to to parse out the differences there
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
well I I just thought i' asked a
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
question since representative King who
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
can't be here had sent that over to me
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
and those were only really the two
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
differences with respect to um their
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
language and the language that you put
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
in front of us so I think um so with
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that being put aside I think I said
 
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much nailing in on the
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
scope we have some homework to do um
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully getting the list the 73
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
providers with the residential aspects
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
taken out um and then we'll talk to uh
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
the committee researcher to maybe get
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
the The Matrix of you know the type of
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
substance uh misuse and you know what is
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight so that's I think from the
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
first bit of this what we kind of want
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
to cover um and we talked a little bit
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
about how the legislation I'm going on
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
to the next little bit on the agenda how
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation fulfill the needs identified
 
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.710 align:start position:0%
legislation fulfill the needs identified
um

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
so and the the first question that I had
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a common question that's asked
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
is is is this the first kick at the cat
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
or are we building this up off of you
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
know certification that uh models that
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
are existent in other states or is this
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
something that you guys
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
just this is basically a New Hampshire
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
grown thing sure and certainly I would
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
defer to my colleagues what they they
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
know about what happens in other states
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
we did some research on each state or
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
most states do this differently right
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
some have um really do more facility
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
licensing uh for uh both inpatient and
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
outpatient some um do nothing at all um
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and some have some do certification for
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
for both residential and outpa each each
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
model looks a little bit different um I
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recall if there are other
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
states that have both licensing and
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
certification program I I I don't you
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
know this may um you know that may be a
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
difference that we have here but many
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
other states have some um some version
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
of this is my my understanding yeah so
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
would would there be value in gathering
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
or what do you guys
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
think in terms of looking at what other
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
doing I would think other states are
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
doing a hell of a lot more than we are
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
so I would think it's useful if we can
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
find out what are the
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
progressive States I still have a
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
question of who these 73 Medicare
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
providers are uh and because the people
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
who are providing services are are not
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
Medicare providers Medica Med Medicaid
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh that
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh the I I think it's important to get
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
that information because that implies
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
some degree of Professional Training
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah to get qualified but the the bulk
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
of people who are providing services are
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about and
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
nobody knows who they are what's the
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
background what's the
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
training and what the programs are um
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
and but I I think it's I would agree
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
that getting information
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid providers is very
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
important because hopefully they're
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to say these are the approaches
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
that one should take and not that you
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
need to get a breakfast every morning or
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
you need to sleep all night or things
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
like that which have nothing to do with
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
the treatment um so I I think getting
 
00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:27.799 align:start position:0%
information from these medic providers
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
is essential okay Mr bar if I could just
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
add very briefly I think that it's
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind as you're
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
looking through the list of 73 Medicaid
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
providers that though we we have a list
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
that we know who they are that we still
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
do not have an oversite mechanism to
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
enforce best practice there to ensure
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
that they're providing high quality you
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
know high quality service uh that you
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
know I mentioned it earlier just as a if
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
you are looking for a list of names of
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
organizations that's a very good place
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
to start but it's very important to keep
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
in mind that um should things go wrong
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
there there be reports wrong we still
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a great mechanism to step in
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
and and to um you know ensure the best
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
practices are being followed and could I
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
just as a clarification Mr chairman yes
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
please and and my understanding is Yes
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
again you if if it's a Medicaid Program
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
there will be licensed providers and you
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
can bring something against a licensed
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
provider but you can't can't deal with
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
the culture of the
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
institution and even if we have a list
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid providers we don't have
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
a list of those people who are providing
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
some kind of service but not billing
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for it so uh so they haven't
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
qualified as a Medicaid provider and
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't have that level of
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
supervision so if I'm understanding we
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't have enough supervis Vision over
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid providers
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
globally and we don't have any
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
supervision at all over everybody
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
else nor do we know who exactly they are
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
so which is why we need the
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
certification program and that said I'm
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
more than happy to look at what happens
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
in other states but I think we have an
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
idea of the scope of the problem in our
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
state and I think what we ought to be
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
looking at um is how we deal with it in
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
our state because if
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
the states are all over the map looking
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
at somebody whose model initially
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't track what ours does um is in my
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
opinion not a great use of our time well
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
my thinking was one of the uh one of the
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
concerns that was raised um is if we go
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
down the certification route um is that
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to discourage people kind of
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
entering into the arena and so my
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
thought was is there something to be
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
gleaned from the experience of others
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
when they've gone forward down this path
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
H have they seen a drop off in in
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
certain areas um and and it may not it
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
may not apply directly to our situation
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
but you know representative who I just
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what I don't know right and
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
so um but I do what I do know is that
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
that was a concern that members of the
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
community whole hammered on and I think
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day what I want to do
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
is I want to be able to come back with
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
enough information um I I think there
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people here that want to
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
see this succeed but there are a lot of
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
people that are very skeptical as well
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that I can calm those
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
fears um I'd rather have well it maybe
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
I'll talk with with M Dyer and see what
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
she thinks well I I have your point is
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
very well taken and if we can answer
 
00:56:59.029 --> 00:56:59.039 align:start position:0%
people's fears I think that that's a
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
great thing the other message that I'm
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
getting loud and clear is that
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
discouraging some of the people we're
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
talking about from coming here and
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
entering into these kinds of services is
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
a very good thing and I take and and uh
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
discouraging people is perhaps um one of
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
our goals the you know like like the
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
Serenity Prayer the hard part is the
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
Shapiro um I'd like to suggest maybe a
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
compromise in terms of looking at what
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
other states do and and instead of like
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
finding a whole range of um oversight
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
programs within their Departments of um
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
divisions of Health and Human Services
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
and how they um organize that and what
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
they actually um
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
have oversight of in those programs that
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
maybe we get a suggestion from um
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in DHHS of one state um that
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
they feel um generally does a good job
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
of um providing oversight for um Health
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services programs and we look
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
at what that one state does and and then
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
we could look at some of the questions
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
that representative mlan has talked
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
about in ter terms of whether there was
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
a downturn in people um creating
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
programs um what elements of programs
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
that people actually like look into to
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
have oversight um but that instead of
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
like looking at what everyone in the
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
United States does that we pick one um
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
to maybe um think about how we want
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
model our program and and if I may the
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
other thing to do perhaps is to
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
go a little more thoroughly into our
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
most close sister States um because we
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
are competing always with Maine Vermont
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for practitioners so
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
knowing what the climate is immediately
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
around us I think is is very useful and
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of those will provide a
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
model uh
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
for um either dispelling fears or or
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
taking us in a different direction one
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
other yeah so I can take that action
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
then to you know have that discussion
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
with the hhsc if you know hey we we
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
think these folks do a good job based on
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
our understanding and then I can meet up
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
with Christine and we'll just kind of go
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
through and look at them and look at the
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
adjacent States um okay representative
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
McKay along those same lines uh
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
could you and I'm talking to Mr Barry uh
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
find somebody who is competent to give
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
us a a b practicum on professional scope
 
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.710 align:start position:0%
us a a b practicum on professional scope
of

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
practice because it seems to me that's
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
basic for what we need to know and there
 
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.670 align:start position:0%
basic for what we need to know and there
are

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
massive points of view uh so that uh I
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's one of the social
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
work groups of the psychologist or
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist uh whoever it might be or
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
whether there's somebody that has
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
specialized in this that would be
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
massively helpful you're referring
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative to different levels of
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
care and and yes what what uh people are
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
are going seeking treatment and not
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
getting it and being taken advantage of
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
I would I I would think that any of my
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues here on the right might be
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
able to speak to speak to this to to
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
some degree maybe
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
not yeah that that would be very helpful
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
us oh go ahead oh I I was just gonna say
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
that um what we can do is if you don't
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
mind we can just spell it out and that
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
way you have it in front of you I think
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit more clear because
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
there maybe some of the folks who are
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
not here that may also want to know does
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
that make
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
sense that okay if we did that yeah is
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
that what you were going to say there we
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
it yes as as as much as I hate to
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with my colleague here um
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative McKay I would warn us
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
against um going beyond the scope of
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
basic best practices and delving into um
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
different clinical
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
um theoretical models I think that's Way
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
Beyond um the scope of this bill Way
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
Beyond the scope of what the legislature
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
should be doing and and just in terms of
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
my minuscule time in clinical practice
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I've seen a lot of um models
 
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.630 align:start position:0%
um you know I've seen a lot of um models
of

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
treatment come become very popular be
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
discredited or people just move on to
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
something else you know you know we
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
start with Freudian Drive Theory and we
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
like you
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
know it's not it's not our it's not our
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
job to decide which is the the
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate clinical models um but to
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
assure kind of basic
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
um basic safety basic best practices
 
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.069 align:start position:0%
um basic safety basic best practices
basic

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
basic
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
um respect for clients um in providing
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
treatment ments so I think we should um
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
be careful about going beyond that for
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
for that very reason representative the
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
the legislation the way we drafted it
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
was was was silent as regards to what
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
the specific certif certification
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirements are we thought that um you
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
know the department through an you know
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
extensive stakeholder process is in a
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
much better position to determine what
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
those requirements look like we're
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
really here to help get that process
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
started and and and I would just say
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
like my colleague here I I probably have
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
very strong feelings about what what
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
creates change and what doesn't create
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
change and um but you know I'm not
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
really sure what I believe is totally
 
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.190 align:start position:0%
really sure what I believe is totally
correct

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
either Mr chairman just just to answer
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
that uh this is a sneaky way to get Joe
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
to come back to testify at uh at some
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
more legislative session he's not going
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
to run again
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
which which he knows I'm not happy about
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
but but that's
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
irrelevant what I'm looking for is a
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
general statement uh that the
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
legislature can utilize um and maybe I
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said social workers
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
psychologist and so on but to to maybe
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
to ask the department um what their uh
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
definition is so that we have something
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
to um go on as to uh what what is
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
motivating behind this is a misuse of
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
people's disability and being taken
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
advantage of and that they're asking us
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
to stop that from happening and we have
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
have to have some basis for saying what
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
what what's appropriate practice um and
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
if if however we can get at that uh
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
repres respect
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
yeah our committee has
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally worked very hard and I
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
would be very unhappy to depart from
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
this at leaving what is the scope of
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
best practice to the practitioners of
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
that practice and keeping we the
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
legislators no matter how knowled ible
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
about that particular practice out of it
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
so I I want to be very sure that
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're sticking very clearly in this
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee solely to the text of this
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill because we have
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
no and and anybody can talk to anybody
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
else about the more Global issues but
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's not our task here um and and I I
 
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make it very clear I'm very
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
concerned if we get into scope of
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
practice issues rather than a list of
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
the types of practitioners or how
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're regulated that that is fair game
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
but leaving to those in the field
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
and I know nothing about mental health
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
practice but I have been a teacher and
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things I can say is that
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
every child I ever met learn differently
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
from every other child I ever met and so
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
offering a wide range of
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities is a very good thing
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
because what works for somebody you know
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
I can take Tylenol but it isn't going to
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
alleviate pain I can promise you uh but
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
it works like a treat for some of people
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
um we need what we need to have is a
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
basic level of understanding
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
accountability and then we may need more
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
yet so I I think that's we're in pretty
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
much broad agreement that we what we we
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to get down to at the end of the
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
day is Clarity in terms of what types of
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
practice are being covered and what is
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
not so if if 12 step is not covered then
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
we want it to be as explicit as possible
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
and that's where we want to go and I
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
think if we can do that to start that
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
will address a lot of the concerns uh
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
that we have so I think um with that we
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
we hit on the bulk of the the stuff you
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
know I wanted to get to in the agenda
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
today I have a list of of action items
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh to go through to do some data
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
gathering over the course of the summer
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
so um at this point I just kind of want
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
to open it up is there you know anything
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
that um any body anywhere uh thinks that
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
we've missed um that that should be
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
brought up and should be given some
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
attention over the summer again so when
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
we come in in September we're ready to
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
go at it hard any additional thoughts
 
01:08:08.359 --> 01:08:12.269 align:start position:0%
go at it hard any additional thoughts
comments

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
items all right folks on the committee
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
we're all set all right well in that
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
case um I'm going to close the hearing
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
sp495 and I'm going to thank everybody
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
very much uh for coming I look forward
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
to maybe communicating with some of you
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
over the summer and getting back to work
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
in September all right thank you all for
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
your attention to this important matter
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
