00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
absolutely took a second for
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
to remember what we were talking about
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the first year of our
 
00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.870 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the first year of our
term

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of technical problem
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm remembering correctly
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
we shelved it and then for the first
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
year we're planning to readdress it this
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
current year
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
but it we're told it was folded into a
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
senate piece of legislation is that is
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
path that this took am i correct in that
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
i believe you are but i don't have the
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
the i don't have the bill of the senate
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill in front of me does anyone else
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
have any information on that
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
i i do have a note that uh
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
that it was to be incorporated into
 
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:11.670 align:start position:0%
that it was to be incorporated into
sb-34

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
based upon that the recommendation would
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
be not recommended for any future
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that's our options today
 
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.509 align:start position:0%
legislation that's our options today
understood

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
would anyone like to make a motion at
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
can we take a look and see guys
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not finding that i'm not finding
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
that bill is relative to the definition
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
of a controlled drug analog and
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sailor possession of
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine and urine uh additives
 
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.750 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine and urine uh additives
and

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
let's just take a look and see if it's
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe 134 oh okay yeah i'll have a look
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
go go ahead and
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
come up and
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
oh look at that
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
good morning honourable members of the
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
helen hanks i'm the commissioner of the
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and um again
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
we did work collaboratively in 2021 to
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
put forward a bill that the department
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
could operate under um we certainly
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
defer to the legislature whether you
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
move forward with that the
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity it provides is that
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
reference to 12 months so that someone
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
could actually apply 12 months before
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
they're two-thirds and thus if the
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
sentencing judge and the prosecuting
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
attorney don't object and concur then
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
they could be released at that two-third
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
mark and then we were working to balance
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
the length of sentence um as well as
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
other concerns expressed by the victim
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
and survivor community so again we are
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
neutral just being a partner and trying
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
to bring forward a piece of legislation
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we could work and operationalize
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
as um
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
as this legislation was proposed were
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
you in favor of the way it was drafted
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
or did you
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
not uh in the in in the initial proposal
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
we were not in favor is the amendment
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
that was referenced that we worked on
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we could support that process
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
greg

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
greg
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
was there any resolve done by the senate
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
and have we already passed some
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislation on this at this point that
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know of that's a great question and
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
to my understanding nothing has passed
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
associated with this concept
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome um
 
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:19.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.629 align:start position:0%
go ahead
[Music]

00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
would this apply to anyone or is would
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
there be certain crimes that this would
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
not apply to
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is a great question and by nature
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
of our policy
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
we do have a list of crimes that are
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
excluded from participating and i don't
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
have that in front of me today
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i would have to look back to the
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
originating statute
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe it specifically
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
excludes it only requires the department
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
to create a policy from which to review
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the

thank you thank you mr chair and thank
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you said
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
you didn't support the bill originally i
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
think you said uh originally uh
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
the the change i saw
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the amendment which is not before us
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh changed from 18 months
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
within 18 months of serving two-thirds
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
to 12 months
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
is you didn't support the 18 but you did
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
support the 12 is that the big change
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
that was um thank you for that question
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that was the change and in fairness
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
without the two in front of me i believe
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
there was also some things around the
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
actual sentence length and when um and i
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
i could be confusing this with another
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%

omnibus bill does have the language with

that omnibus bill
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh says is within 12 months of serving
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the minimum sentence so

work session on hp 205 and open the work
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
session hb 253
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
requiring law enforcement officers to
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
use body cameras and establishing a
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
grant program to assist law enforcement
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
with agencies with purchase of body-worn
 
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
with agencies with purchase of body-worn
cameras

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
um i'll open by saying that
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
a bill did pass
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
hb i believe i mean sp 401 was a hp 401
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
that provided um
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
grant money for body cameras
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
and i believe that was signed into law
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any more comments
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
they'd like to make on that
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
i just saw a post today from the state
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
police indicating that they are
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
rolling out their body-worn cameras and
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
cruiser cameras that's a great step
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
one part of this bill and i was the
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor although was
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
actually renee cushing's bill
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
actually renee cushing's bill
was

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
to support departments around the state
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
that are not state police and to try to
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
create a funding mechanism
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
that gives them a way to offset those
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
costs i know dover has done it at it out
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
of its budget and it's very expensive
 
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.470 align:start position:0%
of its budget and it's very expensive
um

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
this bill clearly wasn't the solution
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that there maybe would
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
be a solution to create a pool of money
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
for local communities
 
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.470 align:start position:0%
for local communities
to

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
to pay for these and to
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually the bill did
 
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.350 align:start position:0%
actually the bill did
um

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was a sp or hb 401 i think it um the
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill that created the uh if you recall
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative burt was opposed to it
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
because it uh provided dash cams for the
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
d.o.t it also provided a pool of money
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
for body cameras for local
 
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
for body cameras for local
municipalities

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
in that case we are probably okay i
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
think so i agree
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
the only thing um that wasn't adopted
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
was the mandate portion of it um but um
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
personally i think that they're all
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
coming along in due course
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this bill
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no one would anyone like to make
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
sorry about that uh
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
motion that
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%

i'll start by just saying that um
 
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
i'll start by just saying that um
we

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
as a body produced
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
numerous pieces of legislation
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
regarding cannabis
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh to the best of my knowledge none
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
of them made it out of the senate alive
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
let alone to the governor's desk
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
i anticipate
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
there will be no shortage of them in the
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
future i don't necessarily see a need
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
for this committee to recommend future
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislation i suspect it's going to
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
legislation i suspect it's going to
self-generate

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
self-generate
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
um would anyone else like to comment or
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
talk about it representative bourdain
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair um
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
i did look at the bill uh yesterday and
 
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.110 align:start position:0%
i did look at the bill uh yesterday and
um

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's more of a first step
 
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.909 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's more of a first step
of

00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of cannabis
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
commercialization

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
but there was one issue i had with it
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
and that is it
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
did not make
 
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.710 align:start position:0%
did not make
the

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
an age limit of 21 is an age limit of 18
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
like all other controlled substances we
 
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
like all other controlled substances we
are

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing the state alcohol and tobacco that
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis should be
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh at for the same
 
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.909 align:start position:0%
uh at for the same
age

00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh
 
00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.669 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh
possibly

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
that the bill that we offered
 
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:08.350 align:start position:0%
that the bill that we offered
um

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.909 align:start position:0%
um
526

00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
526
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be a great model for
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else like to talk
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
i respectfully disagree
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i will vote accordingly
 
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
and i will vote accordingly
okay

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
i recommend not to recommend
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative um i'm sorry you had
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
eliminating the fines for personal
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
possession seems to be one of the things
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people do actually agree
 
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.230 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people do actually agree
on

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the need for future
 
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the need for future
legislation

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
i think that there's definitely a need
 
00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:01.430 align:start position:0%
i think that there's definitely a need
to

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
to basically
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
completely decriminalize personal
 
00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:08.070 align:start position:0%
completely decriminalize personal
possession

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
possession
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
whether this is the approach to do it um
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
is is an entirely different question so
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
my question to the chair is are we
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
are we supporting
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
would we be supporting the approach in
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill by doing that uh or
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
could we make a broader recommendation
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
for example that we support
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
eliminating penalties for personal
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can make a
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation broader than the actual
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation itself because we would be
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
recommending this bill feature
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislation not not necessarily a policy
 
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
legislation not not necessarily a policy
um

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we've had hours and hours
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
of discussion in this committee um
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
nowadays regarding this and we all
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
pretty much know where we stand on it um
 
00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.909 align:start position:0%
pretty much know where we stand on it um
i

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
i i agree that there that there needs to
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
be work done in that area and as i said
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
i suspect there'll be no shortage of
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
bills coming forward in the fall
 
00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
bills coming forward in the fall
and

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
i just in my opinion i don't think that
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
this committee as a as a policy body
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
needs to weigh into it
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
and pre-judge it before we actually get
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
bills in the fall
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize representative
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
i recommend that we
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
not recommend this for future
 
00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
not recommend this for future

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
two nays
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
the motion carries the recommendation is
 
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.590 align:start position:0%
the motion carries the recommendation is
adopted

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um with these i do not believe there's a
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
minority majority report i think it's
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
just the committee report
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
describing the um
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
if one is needed though i will get back
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
to uh representative true or
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
representative ordinary if we need a
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
minority report
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
so at this point i will close the work
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
session on hb 526 and open the work
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
session on hp 1105 relative to earn time

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
was a little more complicated
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
um so let's open up does anyone have
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think the subject matter is something
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's worth looking into
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
we started this process from several
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
years back
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's been somewhat successful
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
i i can't remember what was actually in
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i think the subject matter is worthy
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
of a future legislation
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we can do that but
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
ah thank you i
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
i believe the debate on this was
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
regarding courses that could be taken on
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
a tablet and whether or not
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
there was merit to that um i would like
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
one more time to quickly hear from the
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner if she doesn't mind
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
on where that stands and where she sees
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
again helen hanks commissioner of the
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for the record
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um i believe that was the concern
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
brought forward by ms scitec that we
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
were using the tablet-based programs
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
we used those quite effectively during
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
covet quarantining our teachers and
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
educators use the learning management
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
systems within that to push course
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
materials from our granite state high
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
school and we also use them on the
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
courses referred to as the correctional
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation institute in the peace
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
education program in tandem
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have suspended those temporarily
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
because we had a technological glitch on
 
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.870 align:start position:0%
because we had a technological glitch on
the

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
peace education and correctional
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation institute we're working
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
on the vendor on a new product
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
but we still continue to use those with
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
our granite state high school just like
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who take courses in the
 
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.430 align:start position:0%
individuals who take courses in the
community

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
can participate in their course online
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
when we have units under quarantine and
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
we do occasionally still have units
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
under quarantine
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
we'll figure covet is still here
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
if i may ask the
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
if you could there was there was some
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
discussion or comments made regarding
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
the ability of a prisoner or inmate to
 
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.149 align:start position:0%
the ability of a prisoner or inmate to
take

00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
numerous courses in one day
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and get good time for practically
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
just laying in bed for a day and taking
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
course of course can you give us a
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
little input as far as how rigorous
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
these are and
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
um whether that's a possibility
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
i mean i think someone could lay in bed
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
just like a college student lays man
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
takes their courses that's quite a
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
description but um
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
i go back to the individuals who are
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated have a fifth on average a
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
fifth grade education level so if the
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
course materials are so high that they
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
can't understand them then there's no
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
point in delivering the materials so for
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
you or i the rigor would not be as
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
rigorous but for someone with a fifth
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
grade education they do
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
do need to take time to go through them
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes don't understand some of
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
the words
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
the peace education program itself takes
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
five hours and the other correctional
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation institute courses take
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
differing amounts of time it was those
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
in combination not separately that would
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
have awarded people earn time credit
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
we deliver and provide earn time credit
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
in numerous other areas of the agency as
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
prescribed by law and i think that also
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
has meaning here
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
people's meaningful participation in
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment is actually one
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the number one areas people remit for
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
earn time credit and then obviously with
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
the federal change in the pell grant
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
will have increased opportunities
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
through post-secondary education as well
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
as attaining their high school diploma
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
their high school equivalency and other
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
career and technical education sets to
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
earn earn time credit and as the
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislature outlined it for attaining
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
your high school diploma you actually
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
receive 120 days
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then you receive 60 days for
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
additional vocational programming as
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
outlined in law and then our family
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
connection center program as well
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i i didn't mean to um besmirch
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
the position of the inmate when they
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
were actually taking the course i just
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
it was the vision that was being
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
portrayed it looks shocking when you say
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
it that way yeah when i think about
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
someone going to college absolutely
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
young people in my family i don't think
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature is concerned with their
 
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
the legislature is concerned with their
uh

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
vertical or horizontal position but
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
what the concern was is not necessarily
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
the academic rigor as far as we would be
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerned because i do believe it should
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to the education
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
um but the amount of time that they had
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
to invest was was more the concern like
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
they couldn't just burn through these
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
like four or five a day or something
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
i think that they could on the
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
correctional rebate rehabilitation
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
institute again they're individuals who
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
have almost uh 10 to 11 hours a day
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
where they could be engaged for that
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
um but i did put a pause on those
 
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.510 align:start position:0%
um but i did put a pause on those
and

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.230 align:start position:0%
and
in

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
respect the information that had already
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
come to me prior to this legislation
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
moving forward to evaluate them as
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature asked me to under the
 
00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.830 align:start position:0%
the legislature asked me to under the
statute

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
and as far as that opportunity i would
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
hasten to say if we remove the tablet as
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to deliver our high
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
school programming through the learning
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
management system it would actually slow
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
the technological progress of the
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
department of corrections in trying to
 
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
department of corrections in trying to
deliver

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:53.190 align:start position:0%
deliver
education

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
i tend to agree i don't think we should
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
be limiting possibilities for anybody
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
this particular ability that's in front
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
um did
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
did you or other people
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
have do work on this and and come up
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
with some solutions to that and and
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
would need to be amended to make it the
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
way that it needed to be to make sure
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
they were getting the education getting
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
it properly with the proper constraints
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
and rules and regulations
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
my my question just relies it goes to
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
my confusion with kind of this process
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
because it's the first time that i that
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with where we the
 
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.710 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with where we the
recommended

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
to have a bill be recommended to go
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.149 align:start position:0%
to have a bill be recommended to go
forward

00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously there is someone could
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
write a whole new bill and it could go
 
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.269 align:start position:0%
write a whole new bill and it could go
forward

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
with how it affected the corrections
 
00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.909 align:start position:0%
with how it affected the corrections
department

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
is it more beneficial or efficient to
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
recommend something like a bill like
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
this for legislation
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
as opposed to someone starting from
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
scratch and trying to rewrite the bill i
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
suppose they could copy this bill and
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
submit it but just just your experience
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
and thoughts on that
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
i thank you for that question and i've
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
had the fortunate experience with being
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
with the agency since the inception of
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
runtime credit and the changes that have
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
moved forward since then i don't believe
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that section of law needs adjustment um
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't recommend changes to their
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
own time credit law i think the
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
department manages it quite efficiently
 
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
department manages it quite efficiently
and

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
i respect the feedback that was provided
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it would have taken
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
legislation to ask the department to
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
look at an area of concern we would have
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman commissioner you
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
addressed just there the question that i
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
had is
 
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.789 align:start position:0%
had is
um

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
does the feedback you've received
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
give you guidance that you can move
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
forward with to address any concerns and
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
it sounds like with the pause you're
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
already doing so that would negate the
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
need for future legislation or at least
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from this committee i
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
would agree and in addition to we also
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
created an earn time credit review
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
committee so individuals who wanted to
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
remit other programming not identified
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
in law or specifically in policy that it
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
gets reviewed by a multi-disciplinary
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
corrections committee before it comes
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay oh representative muse
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
during during testimony one of the
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
things that we heard was that there are
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
some issues around uh the notification
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
process when people take these courses
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
um so the impression that i got um i
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
think from hearing um i think there was
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
a uh some uh someone uh from the from
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
the coalition who was here there's an
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
issue with uh victims being continually
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
notified when these when these uh
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
courses are are completed how does that
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
work do you
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
have i know you were here for that
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
testimony has anything changed about
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
your process do you
 
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.470 align:start position:0%
your process do you
maybe

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.750 align:start position:0%
maybe
notify

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
notify
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
victims after four or five completions
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
or when they've actually accumulated
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
time to have a sentence reduction or is
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
this a process where people are just
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
continually getting disturbing emails
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh represent muse that's a great
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
question so we're working and we
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a new administrator of
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
victim services unfortunately our
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
previous one got a really great
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity we couldn't salvage it but
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
we have a new
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
great human being in that capacity we're
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
we're still working on how do we try to
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
bundle those um and uh
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
and a person
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're also moving forward with the vine
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
electronic notification system so it's a
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
self-service model for someone who wants
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
victim notification to choose when they
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
so i think those two things will help
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
i do think there was an expressed
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
concern for people who were sentenced
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the inception of the law
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
in 2014 attorney head might have that
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
date right
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
going forward and still asking for this
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the question i asked was
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
is there some restriction you could put
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
that if it wasn't on your minimus then
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't ask again but i i'm not the
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
judiciary so i could be interfering
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
people's due process privilege here
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
rhodes

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
rhodes
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
just to clarify could you
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
could you clarify whether or not the
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
the victims assistance unit is on on
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
this committee or is not on this
 
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:31.589 align:start position:0%
this committee or is not on this
committee

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
so the victim
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
services bureau within our agency
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
is not on the committee to review earn
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
time credit but is part of the process
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
that if someone is awarded earn time
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
credit that we make our statutory
 
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
credit that we make our statutory
notification

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we're being responsive to those
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
concerns trying to see if we can
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
bundle how that happens so they don't
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
get you know four or five notifications
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
through the course of six months but
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
they get one notification that these
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
four events happened
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
because it changes someone's sentence
 
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
because it changes someone's sentence
structure

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like the um like the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the department has a
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
good handle on this and they've taken
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
the feedback from the um although i have

uh just forgot again that representative
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
gathright wanted to ask a question

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
sorry mike that
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
well it's a comment i think um i had a
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
note here that um
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing that
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner hanks had testified
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
and she was against the bill
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
and she personally review all the
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
credits and releases recommend you know
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
for everyone that comes before him and
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
um which i thought was really
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
exceptionally great that something like
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
that even occurs that there's another
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
eye that's really looking at everyone
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
that wants the burn time credits and
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so for me i don't
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this is necessary
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
and should be recommended
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%

the recommendation is not recommended
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
for future legislation at this point i
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on hb 1105
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on hp 1127
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the posthumous exonerations
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
and annulments
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
and this bill if i recall was um
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
also one from
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative cushing and it had to do
 
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
representative cushing and it had to do
with

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
i believe someone who was wrongly
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
accused of witchcraft in the
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
i believe that there were some questions
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to whether someone would
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
have standing
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
such a motion to the court
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i also believe that we discussed
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
that the executive
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
has the
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
culinary power to grant pardons and
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
actually correct this record
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
much easier than than a court process
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
would um so anyone have any comments or
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
wish to discuss this
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes realizing that whatever we vote
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
today isn't going to
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
make any difference once the elections
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
take place and new people come in
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
this should not be recommended because
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that we heard
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
the senate came from the bay state
 
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.349 align:start position:0%
the senate came from the bay state
so

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's nothing we could have done about it
 
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.910 align:start position:0%
it's nothing we could have done about it
so

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
be recognized for a motion
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
that this not be recommended for future
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislation i'm going to uh hold that on
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
and let anyone else who wishes to speak
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
talk first representative gathering
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention that we verified
 
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention that we verified
that

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
the judge that made the decision in the
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
case was new hampshire and not
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because that was brought
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
up in the hearing and
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can go online you can see all the
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
documentation and everything was handled
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
was it um
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
was it not at the time though still part
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts i believe that's not
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
what it says
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
it says it was new hampshire
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay well i i guess that's really
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
neither here nor there as far as whether
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
or not we
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward representatives
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes i i just wanted to point out that
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
this isn't the first time this has come
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
up in the legislature with hb2 last year
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we did as a body
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
was that we basically
 
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.710 align:start position:0%
was that we basically
forgave

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
forgave
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
the people who violated the governor's
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
cove executive orders
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
now the governor signed the bill and
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's why it went into law
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
but if we were to uh
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill like this in the
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
legislature the governor would also be
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
required to sign it into law before it
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:11.109 align:start position:0%
becomes law
so

00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
while the powers of pardoning are
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
reserved for the governor i went through
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
the law pretty pretty carefully the
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive council
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
are the folks who are in charge of
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
pardons what we're talking about here
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
isn't the pardon of a person um who is
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
still alive
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about uh creating an
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
injustice and or i'm sorry we're talking
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
about fixing an injustice uh
 
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.750 align:start position:0%
about fixing an injustice uh
and

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that that is within
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
our power um
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
i i do think that this is a bill uh that
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we should consider again because i
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
mean part of
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think one of the reasons why a lot of
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
us here are here is to make sure that
 
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
us here are here is to make sure that
um

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
that wherever we can we can we can fix
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
injustice when we see it and if you look
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
at these particular cases
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
having people convicted of witchcraft
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and people
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
um unfairly uh
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
accused of crimes that when we look back
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know this there's a lot of doubt
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know who was actually in error here
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
was it was it the person who was uh
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
accused of the crime or was it some of
 
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.470 align:start position:0%
accused of the crime or was it some of
the

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh officials in government who went
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
after that person
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this thing is is
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily cut and dry
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
but i would like to see it come back in
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
represent testimony
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
what worries me about this one it's a
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot like
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
tearing down statues that we seem to be
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
in vogue right now of people who
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
possibly had some
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
long past
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
what we think to be
 
00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:54.390 align:start position:0%
what we think to be
a

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
honoris type of
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
of activity and you know
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
things that happened in the past
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
are not good or bad i have a
 
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
are not good or bad i have a
have

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
rallies my wife were incarcerated in in
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
in world war ii
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're not looking
 
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.990 align:start position:0%
we're not looking
to

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.870 align:start position:0%

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
condemn
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's over with
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'll say this um
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's obvious from the record that
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
miss goody was um wrongfully accused and
 
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.710 align:start position:0%
miss goody was um wrongfully accused and
sentenced

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
sentenced
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
and we cannot bind a futurist
 
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
and we cannot bind a futurist
legislature

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.910 align:start position:0%
legislature
um

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
but we could we can make a
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation as a committee that
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
while this would not erase or change
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
history what it would do is is
 
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
history what it would do is is
acknowledge

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
the current body's um
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognition of a
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
of a past wrong
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
um so i i
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see the harm in
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
recommending it for future legislation
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if the next body comes in and
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
decides to do so but i think as a policy
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
statement from this committee
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
it would be a good move for us to
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that there was an injustice
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
done here
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
and it wouldn't change history it would
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
still be there as a matter of fact it
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
would add to the history that we
 
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:28.870 align:start position:0%
would add to the history that we
actually

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
saw and recognized and and and
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct it
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i would um recognize representative
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
i move that hb 1127 be recommended for
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%

add that i i support this also in part
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
because of the many years of hard work
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
that uh the late representative cushing
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
and many attempts he made to
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
to right this wrong and that's part of
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
the reason i supported this spell so in
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
his honor
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
um at this point i will close the public

reducing the penalty for first time drug
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
possession and repealing certain
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentences
 
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentences
um

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say the same thing i said
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
on the previous
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
as a committee i don't think we should
 
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
as a committee i don't think we should
be

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
making recommendations on things that
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
are sure to come before us
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the fall and pre-judging i think we
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
should just wait and see what comes to
 
00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
should just wait and see what comes to
us

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
and hear the pills um as they come on
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
their own merits
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think enough bills have come out of
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
and our position has been pretty clear
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
on them and they just haven't seemed to
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
get any traction so i'm recommending
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
just wait and see what comes to us and
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
see deal with it as it gets here anyone
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that our recommendation i'll second
 
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.109 align:start position:0%
is that our recommendation i'll second
it

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
i can as chair um representative
 
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.069 align:start position:0%
i can as chair um representative
casey

00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
casey
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just uh i agree that this
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
will be back i'm sure um
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that this committee has
 
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.950 align:start position:0%
the fact that this committee has
recommended

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh at least one version of this bill um
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
near unanimously in the first year of
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
our term
 
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.549 align:start position:0%
our term
suggests

00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
we support the concept and and should
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
give it that nudge
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
um moving forward i know that this is
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
not the bill
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh that left the committee in that way
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
but there's different ways up the
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
mountain and i think we're gonna have to
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
come up with a new approach
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
seeing as the other ones have failed but
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
as a concept i think it's something that
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
the committee supports and we should
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
give it a recommendation of passage
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
this bit about first offense
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's the first defense they were caught
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
at if anybody believes the people who
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
are picked up on a first offense of
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
are picked up on a first offense of
something

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's the first time they've used drugs
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're using them to i just
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes this bill
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the first offense drug possession i
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
i don't support at all but repealing
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
some of the mandatory minimum sentences
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
i've worked on that before and i think
 
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.510 align:start position:0%
i've worked on that before and i think
sometimes

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing so i have
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
mixed feelings about that particular
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think if we were
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
to recommend this for future legislation
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
it kind of gives a signal that we would
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
approve of it
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
think i echo a lot of what
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
representative welch is saying and i i
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we need to
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
remember is
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of times
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
these these charges are played down so
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
it tends to get watered down in what was
 
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.230 align:start position:0%
it tends to get watered down in what was
actually

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
what the person was arrested for and
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
what they may or may not have actually
 
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
what they may or may not have actually
been

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
charged with and i think that's
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
something we need that we need to
 
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.670 align:start position:0%
something we need that we need to
consider

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
i think we have judges because they
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
judge things because they take things in
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
front of them and consider all the
 
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.630 align:start position:0%
front of them and consider all the
circumstances

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think the mandatory minimums tie the
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
hands of judges in some cases
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
fairly and unnecessarily with the
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
results of the person that's charged
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm opposed to mandatory minimum
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
sentences so therefore i won't i
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
think that we need to recommend this
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill for
 
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.829 align:start position:0%
bill for
future

00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
consideration representative green
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think it gives the people a false
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
sensation that if they get a me a light
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
sentence for the first pers first time
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
possession that they're going to get a
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
light sentence from thereon too so
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to make a motion
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
i make a motion to itl
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
you mean not recommended for future
 
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
you mean not recommended for future
legislation

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%

00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%

yeah i'll read it go ahead um
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
hb uh 1232 uh reducing the penalty for
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
first offense drug possession or
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
repealing certain mandatory minimum
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
sentences the motion on the floor is not
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the vote is to you

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah he would normally go last so that's
 
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
yeah he would normally go last so that's
correct

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%

and open the work session on hp 1281.
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
would the chair like to take over or
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay we will continue
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
relative to access to firearms
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
confiscated from a person who is subject
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
to a protective order um i'll open by
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
saying this was actually my bill
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
um it was designed it was brought
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward at the request of a constituent
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
allow people who had restraining orders
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
to dispose of their firearms
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
in a more cost effective manner than
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
however after speaking with
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
representatives from the domestic
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
violence coalition
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
um i actually recommended that my own
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
bill be sent to interim study
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
and i think there possibly could be some
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
room to work and do something on it but
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
at this time it's in my opinion
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
um not specific enough to recommend for
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
future legislation until i have or
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
whoever would like to speak with
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
and work with the domestic violence
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
coalition but at this point out of
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
respect for their concerns
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
um i would recommend that we not
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommend this for future legislation
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative ordnae
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking about this bill
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
because i understand that uh
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh having your web your firearms uh kept
 
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.549 align:start position:0%
uh having your web your firearms uh kept
by

00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
law enforcement it can be an expensive
 
00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.950 align:start position:0%
law enforcement it can be an expensive
operation

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
and the uh the problem of
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
having just anybody
 
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.549 align:start position:0%
having just anybody
uh

00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
monitored or somebody's or keeps
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's firearms
 
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
somebody's firearms
is

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
a problematic as well because
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
how can they be trusted not to let their
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
friend borrow their firearm
 
00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.829 align:start position:0%
friend borrow their firearm
but

00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the way on the drive over this
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
morning i said who
 
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
morning i said who
how

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
could we do this
 
00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
could we do this
and

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
have to be someone that is licensed or
 
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.109 align:start position:0%
have to be someone that is licensed or
bonded

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
bonded
 
00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
bonded
that

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
they ready are
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with firearms and i'm thinking
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people belong to
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
gun ranges that gun reagents would be a
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
be a keeper of firearms that have been
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh sequestered
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the thought you put
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
into that and i'd be happy to discuss it
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
with you over the off-season
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes when ed brown over in the
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
it was plainsville when he was arrested
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
he had 35 firearms
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they were put in the custody of
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
riley's gun shop
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
now it still cost them for the storage
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
but the complaint
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
originally that we had about this
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
situation was if they're stored at the
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
police stations there's no guarantee
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to not rush and so forth
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
and some of these guns are kind of
 
00:56:17.359 --> 00:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
and some of these guns are kind of
expensive

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.069 align:start position:0%
expensive
so

00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's a situation that needs to have an
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward okay
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
i uh i i tend to agree with you i think
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
that the but the subject matter this is
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
so delicate that it needs to be worked
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
on with a scalpel and it's too um
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's too complicated to for a blanket
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation in my opinion of future
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislation at this point however i will
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
be bringing something forward after
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
consulting with all the interested
 
00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:52.069 align:start position:0%
consulting with all the interested
stakeholders

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:53.350 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
my only question in this bill
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
is it's talking about a relative access
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
to firearms
 
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.870 align:start position:0%
to firearms
so

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that saying that we confiscated them
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
but you can have an access to them
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
the intent was so that a relative
 
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.589 align:start position:0%
the intent was so that a relative
could

00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
pick up the firearms for you
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
and either hold them or dispose of them
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
but you would not have access to them
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
but as i said it it definitely needs
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative abbas
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
so i what i understood too is
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
there's nothing preventing anyone from
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
selling or transferring title
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
if the in the custody of law enforcement
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
it can still be done unless it's
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know evidence of a crime but if it's
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
just simply because of a
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
in a domestic violence restraining order
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited from selling them
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
but for any issues involving domestic
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
violence that everyone knows and
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative rory and i we were at
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
that meeting
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
there was a task force that came out and
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
they put the court system published it's
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
150 pages i recommend everyone take a
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'll have the
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
committee assistant email copy that to
 
00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:19.270 align:start position:0%
committee assistant email copy that to
everyone

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
it was really comprehensive so any
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
issues on that subject including this
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
you know i would kind of focus on what
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
the task force recommendations were
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we have to follow them but
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
just keep put that into consideration
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
agreed and that was also part of my
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
very high uh
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
storage charges by the time
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah agreed that was part of my fear and
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
the constituents fear is that we would
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
end up with a system such as that
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
where once they were gone you may as
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
well forget them and also um my intent
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
was so that
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
the defendant would actually have access
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
to sell them
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
should he require or she require
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
the funds to pay for their council
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward that's the liquid assets
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
tied up so there is a lot of angles to
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at this and like i said i think it
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
will require some definite research
 
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.829 align:start position:0%
will require some definite research
um

00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
i can't make a motion with anyone else
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion representative
 
00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion representative

open the work session on hsb 292

um i'll also address this one this
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
should be really quick
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward at the request
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
of parole probation
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
as they were having difficulty
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
coordinating notifications
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
to them if if one of their parolees or
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
probationers were arrested
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
based on my previous law enforcement
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
experience i knew that there was an
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
electronic way to do this much quicker i
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
met with the state police parole
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
probation and the i.t folks and they
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually were able to figure out a
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
simple um
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully simple fix
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
whereby if someone
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
runs the record arrests
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
or has any interaction
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
with a parolee or probation officer
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's entered into the computer system
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
the probation or parole would be
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
automatically notified immediately so
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
when they came into work the next day
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
they would have a notice that their
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
person was run by somebody that they
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
could follow up
 
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
could follow up
so

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
at the request of probation and parole
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that we do not
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
move forward with future legislation on
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman is is this the
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
possibility though that this will come
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
forward or has it been already done
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
something because of the senate and
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
going through the whole process
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually it was accomplished without
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
legislation um they were able to work
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
with the existing
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
existing system they had and connected
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
everybody so it's no longer an issue so
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't need legislation
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
