00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
hello

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
i you just have to keep so it's ten
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
o'clock and i'm going to start the um
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
 
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
1429

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
1429
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
so the objective of this work session is
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
to determine based on the input that we
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
had during the hearings whether or not
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is worthy of
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
further um legislation
 
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.909 align:start position:0%
further um legislation
right

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
objection that we had
 
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:53.490 align:start position:0%
objection that we had
from

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
first you don't succeed try something
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
else i know
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
the objection that we had to this bill
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
originally was that
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
the use of licensing for law enforcement
 
00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
the use of licensing for law enforcement
was

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
that the committee
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
objected to
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
and there were many um
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions made to address that
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that the testimony from
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
the city of derry
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
towns who had said who had sent
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
letters to the committee
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
enforced the need of this
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
from a from a law enforcement standpoint
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
but the licensing board is not a
 
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.029 align:start position:0%
but the licensing board is not a
policing

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
policing
 
00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.629 align:start position:0%
policing
organization

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.749 align:start position:0%
organization
so

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
have you had any thoughts on that i'm
 
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
have you had any thoughts on that i'm
asking

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
um miss coppola to see to for comment or
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
either one of you or anybody from oplc
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
i agree the licensing board is not
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for law enforcement and that
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
that was an issue i think our main
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
um health and safety from more of a
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
hygiene aspect and it sort of became
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
once law enforcement became part of the
 
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.870 align:start position:0%
once law enforcement became part of the
issue

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
it kind of went in that direction um but
 
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
it kind of went in that direction um but
our

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
focus really is more on health and
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
safety and welfare of the public and
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's more
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know hygiene issues that sanitary
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
issues similar to you know barbering
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics where those
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that are
 
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that are
inspected

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
inspected
um

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for the focus to stay
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
there and and not on law enforcement
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
because i agree that's not what the
 
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
because i agree that's not what the
board

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
so do you have any recommendations of
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
what future legislation would look like
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
how would we amend this to address that
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think it could be amended
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think most of the language um does
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
focus more on sanitary conditions
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
hygiene those types of concerns
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think it may have been the addition
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
of you know including prostitution human
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
trafficking that
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
made this a little bit more of a law
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement type
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
issue so those things could certainly be
 
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
issue so those things could certainly be
removed

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.029 align:start position:0%
removed
um

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know it does talk about any sexually
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
related crime i don't know that it then
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
needs to be
um

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
more specific to include prostitution
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
and human trafficking i think those
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
things necessarily fall within
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
um any any crime involving violence
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
inflicted on a person that type of thing
 
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
inflicted on a person that type of thing
um

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
because any time one of our inspectors
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
goes in to inspect for sanitary
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
conditions for example um
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know if our barber and cosmetology
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
and aesthetics
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
inspectors go in to inspect and they see
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of a crime they can
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
certainly report that to law enforcement
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
as i understand it from
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
the years i've been working with uh
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
your office and your predecessors uh one
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
of your functions is clearly uh
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
of your functions is clearly uh
his

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the statute
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh and whether licensing is being
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
observed and so forth and since
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
these illegal establishments
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
do not meet the necessary criteria
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
for massage therapeutic massage
 
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.310 align:start position:0%
for massage therapeutic massage
administration

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
and one of the functions of your
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors as i understand it is to find
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
out whether
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
the people in the establishment are
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
licensed or not
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.790 align:start position:0%
licensed or not
correct

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
yes correct okay so if they're not
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
licensed because they're not performing
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage they're not
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
qualified to be licensed
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
and they cannot legitimately be licensed
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
then they are operating illegally would
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
if i unders
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain i understand the
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
question if they
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
hold themselves out as a massage
 
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
hold themselves out as a massage
establishment

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we were allowed to have inspectors
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
go in to inspect
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
then they would determine whether anyone
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
was licensed
 
00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
was licensed
correct

00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and since these people are not
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
performing therapeutic massage
 
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
performing therapeutic massage
uh

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
aside from all the health aspects that
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
we've started to talk about a little bit
 
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.190 align:start position:0%
we've started to talk about a little bit
um

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
the the reality is
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
they're violating uh the codes in that
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
regard clearly as well we we've heard
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
stories uh we we talked with several
 
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.230 align:start position:0%
stories uh we we talked with several
people

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
from the town of derry uh who came and
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
they said you know that
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
several of these establishments
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
in other parts of new hampshire as well
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
they they have uh
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
buckets for
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
toilets uh they
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
they are sleeping on the floor on
 
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.269 align:start position:0%
they are sleeping on the floor on
mattresses

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
mattresses
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
they they they are living in the
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
establishment in a way uh they're living
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
their period is is clearly a violation
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
the the establishment is not there for
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
residential purposes so they're
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
violating the law there
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're violating the law with regard to
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
sanitation and and therefore health
 
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
sanitation and and therefore health
requirements

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
they are not licensed to do therapeutic
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
massage and therefore
 
00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
massage and therefore
they

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're operating illegally and under
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the statute and your uh your
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
prerogatives as i understand it they
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
have every they they are
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're not permitted to legally operate
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
and you have the right to shut them down
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
so if an inspector goes into an
 
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
so if an inspector goes into an
establishment

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
and determines that there are violations
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
if they rise to the level of an
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
emergency the board can emergently
 
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
emergency the board can emergently
suspend

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
their license we don't we're not law
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement so we can't shut down
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
businesses but we could emergently
 
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
businesses but we could emergently
suspend

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
the establishment license similarly to
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetics
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
could emergently suspend a shop license
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
which they have done
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
in some cases because everyone was
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and there were a lot of
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
sanitary conditions that raised great
 
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
sanitary conditions that raised great
issue

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
a great concern um so in that respect we
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
a great concern um so in that respect we
could

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
you cannot practice massage here you're
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
emergently suspended until
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that that suspension is lifted but we
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
are not law enforcement the board is not
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so we we can't shut
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
businesses down in the way that you may
 
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
businesses down in the way that you may
have

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
have
intended

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think what um miss calif felidas said
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
earlier was that if the inspector
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors enter the establishment and
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
find that
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to hygienic issues there are
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
if there's a potential crime then they
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
are allowed to notify the local
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
authorities so that
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
they the local authorities would be the
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
ones to address the crime not the lplc
 
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.310 align:start position:0%
ones to address the crime not the lplc
right

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
that is correct as we're not law
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement we aren't going to ignore a
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
crime that we come across we would refer
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
it to local law enforcement
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that local led further legislation
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
would just need to clarify that so that
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
there isn't this gray area that was
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted by the
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee based on the testimony and the
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
bill itself
yes

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
president billy has a question
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
um in an hour we're dealing with
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
a similar thing
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
1444 relative to the registration of
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
medical spas
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
is there any particular reason why this
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
should look much different than that
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
except for the concerns of derry about
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to go in there all the time
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
can i make a comment on that the what
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're addressing
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
the um the bills as written and whether
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
or not they are
 
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
or not they are
can

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
is there something that we can do
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
in the fall to amend them or do they
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
basically do we need to start over this
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
would seem to have a lot of extraneous
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
material i was trying to compare it to
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
something similar
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
the bill that's similar
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
a bill that that passed in the house a
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
while ago concerning cosmetology and
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is we're
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
comparing this bill
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
to previous legislation
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
that has um
 
00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:38.230 align:start position:0%
that has um
similar

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements the medi-spa bill
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
is completely it's not it's new and it's
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
a completely different and it involves
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
different groups of people so this is a
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
bill that really just revolves around
 
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.230 align:start position:0%
bill that really just revolves around
oplc

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the massage
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
therapist the board the board of massage
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
therapists is there anybody here to
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
speak from
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
the board
no

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
because i believe they were notified
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as well
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
so i i apologize i realized i walked in
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
lateness might have already been said so
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to um
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we heard
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
continuously in committee and it sounds
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
continuously in committee and it sounds
like

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
that was addressed with what you had
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
so i i think what i wanted to do my
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is um does there need to
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't just a dairy issue right like
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is not just a local issue that
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know some of the concerns that we
 
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.269 align:start position:0%
you know some of the concerns that we
have

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
happens all across the country not
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily in one town in the state of
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
correct and the um
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
the distinction that we want to make
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
with this bill that was not really made
 
00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
with this bill that was not really made
adequately

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
during hearings was that this is a bill
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
that has to do with public safety and
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
hygiene and the reputation of
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
of employees and the reputation of of
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
owners of businesses
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
and um anything that's
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
extreme that's
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
outside of the sphere of hygiene or
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
would fall under the auspices of a law
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that this bill would
 
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.110 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that this bill would
separate

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
where one
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
function begins and the other one starts
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
which wasn't very clear
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill which is why
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
we had this misunderstanding in the the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
the bill was never meant to
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
address law enforcement but it wasn't
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't stated as such
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
it became
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
there any other questions
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt thank you
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt thank you
so

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
i don't care how we shut these people
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
down understand to the degree that they
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
are violating the law
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
in that they are
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
perp they are purporting to be a massage
 
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.510 align:start position:0%
perp they are purporting to be a massage
establishment

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
as commonly understood
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
and yet they don't have a license
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
because they are not performing
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage they are not trained
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
to do therapeutic massage they don't
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
have any of the credentials therefore
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
they cannot operate
 
00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
they cannot operate
legally

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
legally
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
calling themselves and and they are also
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
violating the health and safety
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
standards that you are responsible for
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that you shut them down
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
um or
 
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.270 align:start position:0%
um or
or

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
cause them to have to
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
go through the entire process of trying
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
to get licensed when they can't
 
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
to get licensed when they can't
so

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
it ain't when you say you're not law
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement well i beg to differ you're
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
not law enforcement in the traditional
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
sense but the law
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh that of the state of new hampshire
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
gives you the authority to intervene in
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
situations which which impact the
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
public's health and safety
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't care what you call it
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
the bottom line for me is that you have
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
the authority in my opinion to stop what
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
they are doing because it violates the
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
those those strictures of the law that
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
you are charged with enforcing
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement although not in the
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
traditional sense but you we don't we
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to we don't have to
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
have a policeman come in and we already
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
know that the police do not get involved
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
because they go in
 
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.909 align:start position:0%
because they go in
[Music]

00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the degree that they get involved at
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
all they go in they discover oh
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
this illegal sexual massage
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh is is occurring here then they arrest
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.470 align:start position:0%
uh is is occurring here then they arrest
the

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
the the one of the girls or several of
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
the girls they take them out the girls
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
get bailed out immediately they get sent
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
to another city new people come in and
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
the whole thing continues as it was
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
before just different faces
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement is not interested in
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
wasting their time
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's a cost of doing business for the
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
operators to bail somebody out send them
 
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.230 align:start position:0%
operators to bail somebody out send them
off

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
and they this is a waste of their time
 
00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
and they this is a waste of their time
but

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
so they're not going to get involved and
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be
 
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be
because

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you folks can stop them for the purposes
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
of protecting the public's health and
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
safety in my judgment so i think that if
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
amend a bill
 
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.549 align:start position:0%
amend a bill
to

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
change some particular aspect
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't call it law enforcement
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
because that would be typically
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstood to be the police
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
but they're not they don't they don't
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to get involved and they're not
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
going to get involved and they don't
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
have to be you can you can shut them
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
down for the purposes that we've already
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
so this might help representative
 
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.789 align:start position:0%
so this might help representative
schmidt

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
a business opens up in
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
a town
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it's called
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
pleasant massage
 
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.270 align:start position:0%
pleasant massage
and

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they haven't they do not have
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
under this legislation a license
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
as a massage establishment
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i am
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
because there are um
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
so if the establishment is on excuse me
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
is unlicensed
 
00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
is unlicensed
um

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
similar to barbarian cosmetology and
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
aesthetics there are a number of shops
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
inspect and find don't have a shop
 
00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
inspect and find don't have a shop
license

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
so there if they have an individual
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
license the board could suspend that
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
we would also refer it to um
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
jay brown at the doj he handles all of
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
our unlicensed practice
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
cases and so he may pursue criminal
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
charges depending on the circumstances
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay so there's two ways that
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
so if they so if there's a lice if it's
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
a job that's open doesn't have a license
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
that can be pursued as
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
possible criminal activity
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
if there is a license
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
issued to a massage establishment and
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
upon inspection
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
there are violations
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
those violations could be
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
violations of
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
the oplc
rules

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
or criminal activity and if it's
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
criminal activity
 
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.789 align:start position:0%
criminal activity
the

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
oplc refers this to law enforcement is
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
that correct is that the way i'm
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
understanding it yes i believe that's
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
so if the
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
if a person goes in to they inspect and
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
they see that this this place indeed is
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
not licensed let's just say that's the
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
case it's not licensed done
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
does the person that is there at that
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
exact time and sees that it is not
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
licensed because i heard what you said
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
about you know the department of justice
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think earlier you were given an
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
example so
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
is there an example that you go in
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed it's
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
evidently clear
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
other things may be happening do you
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
have the ability right then and there
 
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.510 align:start position:0%
have the ability right then and there
to

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
like a cease and desist
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
until the investigation so you can get
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
the investigation launched and then it's
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
done you know like okay upon
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
investigations we found was really
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
happening like maybe it was you know
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
more into the weeds than you initially
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
thought but do you have the ability
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
right then and there
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
to stop if you have the ability to go in
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have the ability to say you
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
must cease and desist at this moment we
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
can tell them that you should not be
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
operating without
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
a license so that is unlawful for
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice and that will be
 
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.230 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice and that will be
referred

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
referred
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
and what happens with the barbering
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics is very often
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
they will continue to practice but we
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
have that date on which they were
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
it was made clear to them you do not
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
have a license you cannot practice
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
without one
 
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
without one
um

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then when we refer it to doj they
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
they handle it from there and they have
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
a date certain that they've been
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a recommendation if we're
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to work on this legislation
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we bring it back
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think we all know the reasons why
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're so focused on it right now
 
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
we're so focused on it right now
so

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say representative grota and
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i kind of team up and work on this
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
legislation i know she's worked on it
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
hard so i don't want to you know let's
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
just say we dive into this
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
is there verbiage that we're able to put
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
in here that would give you any kind of
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
that authority to say
 
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
that authority to say
stop

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
or does does that not exist anyway and
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
some boards have the authority to
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
issue cease and desist type letters but
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
due process
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered so that's after
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
notice and opportunity for hearing um
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
and what we're talking about here is
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and not necessarily
 
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and not necessarily
other

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
criminal activity that type of thing
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
that would again be referred to law
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they can probably take
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
action much sooner
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and more quickly um and again if the
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
person you know if it's unlicensed if
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
the establishment is unlicensed we can
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
refer that to doj and they can handle
 
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
refer that to doj and they can handle
that

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
if it's sanitary conditions and things
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
that are violated the board if it rises
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
to that level that they deem it it's an
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
emergency they can't emergently suspend
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
the license if they have one
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
until they
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
and furthermore if you are inspecting an
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
unlicensed facility and you find
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
criminal activity you can refer to law
 
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
criminal activity you can refer to law
enforcement

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
enforcement
yes

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
so if i may um
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
one of the other aspects of the
 
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
one of the other aspects of the
the

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
establishment license
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
is that in order to be a
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
operating legally you have to have
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
licensed therapeutic
 
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
licensed therapeutic
massage

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:19.050 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners right
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
the girls in these places are not
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
practitioners right they are in most
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
cases captives
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
operators okay
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we've heard is in many cases
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
maybe uniformly they're living
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the establishment
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
they have buckets for toileting purposes
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt we've already
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this i don't i think that your
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
need is being addressed by this
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
i don't understand if you have a
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
question please ask the question and
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't repeat what you just said please
 
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
don't repeat what you just said please
okay

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh my question is
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
since the practitioners also are
 
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.310 align:start position:0%
since the practitioners also are
unlicensed

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
is it not the case that you can
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
that you can cite them for your
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
inspector can cite them for the fact of
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
having unlicensed practitioners
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
operating in their establishment
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
right so if we go in and the
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
establishment has unlicensed people
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
working there
 
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
working there
their

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
establishment license could be
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
emergently suspended we did have a nail
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
salon where that was the case there were
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think five or six people working all
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
of which were unlicensed
 
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.630 align:start position:0%
of which were unlicensed
um

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
and his shop license was emergently
 
00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:49.909 align:start position:0%
and his shop license was emergently
suspended

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the idea there there was no um
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
evidence of criminal activity or
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
anything so that the goal there was
 
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.789 align:start position:0%
anything so that the goal there was
really

00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:27:58.799 --> 00:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
really
to

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know put the consequences on the
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
shop owner because he should have known
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
better and to get the people licensed so
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
that he can open back up we don't want
 
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
that he can open back up we don't want
to

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
be a detriment to workforce um
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
so to the extent you know if somebody's
 
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
so to the extent you know if somebody's
unlicensed

00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
right that can be referred to doj and
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
they can decide based on the
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances to pursue that
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
the establishment license could be
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
emergently suspended
 
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.630 align:start position:0%
emergently suspended
um

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
again that would effectively
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
they'd have to stop operating until they
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
were able to get that reinstated
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
and if we found any criminal activity we
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
would refer that to law enforcement and
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
if there are no further questions are we
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to entertain a motion to
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
is the language currently in the in the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate form
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt all we're doing
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
today is recommending or not
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
recommending for further legislation any
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
amendments this bill will be done in
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
september but i realize that we are in
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the second term so there's
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do to
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh accept the motion that the chair has
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
just indicated or either yes or no on
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
future legislation and it's not even
 
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.230 align:start position:0%
future legislation and it's not even
binding

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
binding
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
i can file the necessary legislation
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
completely independently of this process
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
it just adds a little bit of heft to it
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
if the committee's behind it so
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
but if we need license chain if we need
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
language changes i would ask that
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
you work with
 
00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
you work with
me

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants to get involved
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
to get the language into the shape we
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
need it in so that we can proceed
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
immediately other than that madam chair
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
a move that we recommend for future
 
00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.549 align:start position:0%
a move that we recommend for future
legislation

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
see a second
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
so i'll take a roll call representative
 
00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:16.230 align:start position:0%
so i'll take a roll call representative
bailey

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
bailey
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
you can vote since you're i know you're
 
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.590 align:start position:0%
you can vote since you're i know you're
here

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.470 align:start position:0%
here
yes

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
representative bailey votes yes
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative grotto votes yes so
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
is four to zero
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
end the meeting and it is 10
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
27 thank you so much for being here and
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
we'll see you oh wait wait wait wait
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
hang on so sorry
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
230 which had to do with um
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
which i don't have on my
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
on body are that's correct
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
so are we um
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
therefore going to adopt similar
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislation for body art is that what
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
um the committee could certainly decide
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
to do that it was pointed out that the
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
current language of
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
the body art
 
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.149 align:start position:0%
the body art
314a

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
314a
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
does give the executive director
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
authority to draft rules regarding
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.830 align:start position:0%
authority to draft rules regarding
inspections

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
um inspection of body piercing branding
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
and tattooing establishments that's 314
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
a um six
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
um so given that um we can attempt to
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
draft rules um the one concern that i
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
would have is if the establishments do
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
not have to be licensed or registered
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that may impact our ability to inspect
 
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.669 align:start position:0%
that may impact our ability to inspect
but

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
the current language does allow us the
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
up the
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
is it possible that
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
some of these establishments
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
do not know the answer to that question
 
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.070 align:start position:0%
do not know the answer to that question
i

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
i couldn't say it's not within the realm
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
of possibility i don't know
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
so we would be adopting similar
 
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
so we would be adopting similar
legislation

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean if there are rules
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is this this is the same
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
situation as the massage establishments
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
right if there are no
 
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
right if there are no
hygienic

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
hygienic
 
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.509 align:start position:0%
hygienic
requirements

00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we can't those those establishments
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
reviewed inspected because of current
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislation then we really don't have an
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
effective way of
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules is that correct
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
if there was a registration or a
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
licensing for establishments
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
um that would certainly help facilitate
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
are there any comments from the
 
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.630 align:start position:0%
are there any comments from the
committee

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.789 align:start position:0%
committee
yes

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we had the body art people
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
several years ago already
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
those people are already licensed under
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire law
 
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.549 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire law
okay

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
they are all legitimate practitioners of
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
body art
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
science or whatever you call it
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
they came in
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with the whole
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
that health since the skin is being
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
broken and and
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
various different things are performed
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
under the skin or through the skin
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's clear that uh health and safety
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
aspects are paramount
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay and which is the reason that there
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
was discussion at the time
 
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.509 align:start position:0%
was discussion at the time
of

00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
of
an

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
establishment license since that is the
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
place that you absolutely have to be
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
able to inspect and determine that they
 
00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
able to inspect and determine that they
are

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
doing things
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
in a safe way because otherwise you're
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're opening yourself up to a lot of
 
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.389 align:start position:0%
you're opening yourself up to a lot of
very

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
very
negative

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
uh skin and health ramifications okay
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
and these people are are aware of this
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
and and my understanding was that once
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know the licensing of the
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
practitioners went through that the
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
establishment licensing would also
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh follow so
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is that
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
correct the proposed
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
legislation would have allowed for
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
good okay well we certainly want to if
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
we if we need
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
a gap then i i will move that we
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we recommend this uh bill for
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments representative
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
bailey it's
 
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.870 align:start position:0%
bailey it's
it's

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a range of things where
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
tattoos at the top but
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
down at the level of piercings don't
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
they do this at malls
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't have pierced ears but
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
um yes so there are
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
um you know you can
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
ear piercings there's places you can get
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the mall this includes um body
 
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.150 align:start position:0%
in the mall this includes um body
piercing

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
piercing
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
which could be
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
your belly button your tongue
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
um other more sensitive areas
 
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:52.150 align:start position:0%
um other more sensitive areas
yeah

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
so in the current statute body piercing
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
means the creation of an opening in
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
human tissue except piercing of the
 
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
human tissue except piercing of the
earlobe

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
no no you know
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
ear piercing is all over the place uh
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a common practice
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh even there
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
some health
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh strictures are
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
clearly in order uh and uh but uh the
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
types of things we're talking about in
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
body art is a wholly
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
a different thing
 
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
a different thing
so

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so i didn't hear a second
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
well it's again it's a world i don't
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
move in but don't even teenage girls do
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
i've heard that
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's obviously not the world i'm
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
but this bill accepts that yeah
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:59.190 align:start position:0%
so i think
that's

00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's the difference so it doesn't
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
matter well we've sometimes had things
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
with like well this
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
individuals do things that are right and
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
right okay
um

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i will second
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.750 align:start position:0%
um
motion

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
are we ready to vote
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.870 align:start position:0%

spas
um

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
originally this bill
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
um was presented to the committee and
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
there was significant
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
pushback from a group of physicians
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
and upon
 
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.789 align:start position:0%
and upon
review

01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
this was this is a lobbying organization
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
that did not identify themselves as such
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
and at the time
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
with my
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
inquiry into the secretary of state's
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
office they had not been registered as a
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
so since then
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
they are now telling me they are a
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization but they are not
 
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.630 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization but they are not
here

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore we should just proceed
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
without them unless they show up
 
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
without them unless they show up
their

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.990 align:start position:0%
their
[Music]

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me their
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
objection to the bill was that
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're doctors they know what they're
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
doing and they don't need to be
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
overseen by
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
another organization
 
01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:38.710 align:start position:0%
another organization
um

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
discussions with
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
medical spa owners
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
after the hearing
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
it was learned that
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
doctors will
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
sell their name to these organizations
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
as medical directors
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
yet they have no responsibility
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
they can sell their names to as many
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
organizations as they want
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
and there is no requirement to them it
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
says that you have to have access
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
for a medical director but there's no
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
that is not really specified accesses
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
could be a name on a web page
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:27.829 align:start position:0%
it's not
access

01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
access
for

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
an issue that could come up during a
 
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
an issue that could come up during a
procedure

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
so based on that information the sub the
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee recommended that we review
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
in a work
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee work session and um
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that is there any
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
comment from
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
oplc on this because this is something
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
just briefly um
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
we did discuss this and
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
i think that you you did address some of
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you know doctors are
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
in some instances selling their name so
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
it looks like they have a medical
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
director but in practice they really
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any anyone who
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
has the medical expertise
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
to perform the the treatments and
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
procedures or oversee them or delegate
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
them appropriately
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a big part part of it
 
01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a big part part of it
um

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
this the potential the proposed
 
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.109 align:start position:0%
this the potential the proposed
legislation

01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
does ensure that
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
these procedures which are they are
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
cosmetic in nature but they are
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely medical in nature
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i think that there is sometimes
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
a feeling that well it's just cosmetic
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
but it is medical it does require proper
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
qualifications in order to diagnose and
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a treatment plan and then
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
to supervise and delegate appropriately
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
it does require
 
01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.750 align:start position:0%
it does require
proper

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
education and training
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
um both for the physician or the aprn or
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the naturopath who oversees the
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
the med spa but also for staff and so
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
there has to be somebody properly
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
qualified to ensure that that's
 
01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:31.349 align:start position:0%
qualified to ensure that that's
occurring

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
came up for me in that
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
hair salons in portsmouth
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
and it's very lucrative right it's very
 
01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
and it's very lucrative right it's very
expensive

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
so hair salons are starting to
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
extend into this area
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
and when i've asked them well who is
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually doing the treatment and who's
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know medically supervising it's a
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
very wishy-washy
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
kind of answer
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
and that wishy-washiness
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
is to me a concern
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
i think this is the kind of legislation
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
addressed and specified
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
as simple as okay if there's a medical
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
director they have to be available by
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
phone or by in person within a certain
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
amount of time if there's an issue
 
01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
amount of time if there's an issue
um

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
it could be as simple as that or it
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit more
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
complicated it could be a little bit
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
more intense so
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
more intense so
um

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any recommendations
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
on how we could address this in future
 
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
on how we could address this in future
legislation

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so the the proposed legislation i
 
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.070 align:start position:0%
um so the the proposed legislation i
think

01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.749 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
would address it um there may be
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
certainly you know room for improvement
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
in what was proposed
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
medical director has to be readily
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
available it may be better to specify
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
what that is um
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
i would point out that
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee is aware that
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
the boards of medicine nursing
 
01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
the boards of medicine nursing
um

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and barbarian cosmetology and
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
aesthetics all supported this
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
not only to protect the the public but
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
also the licensees because for somebody
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
who is an esthetician who may be
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
working for a med spa who is told to do
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
something that they it might be outside
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
their scope of practice it would clarify
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
that for them and give them something to
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
point to and say i can't do that without
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
the proper delegation
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
um so i think the language as as
 
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.189 align:start position:0%
um so i think the language as as
proposed

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
did meet a lot of the um
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
it would mean you know it would address
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the concerns i certainly agree
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
that there may be room for improvement
 
01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:58.470 align:start position:0%
that there may be room for improvement
though

01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
concerns brought forth by a-10
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
practices

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
do perform
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
esthetician procedures like facials and
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that they
 
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
and that they
say

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a wall between that part
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
of the business
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the medical part
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that i mean it's that i i get i
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know saying it doesn't make it so
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
distinguish

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
distinguish
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
between for those practices exactly that
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
you talked about right the place where
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a spa
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
yet they're going to they're going to
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
conduct medical procedures so how would
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
we distinguish that
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
um through inspection we would be able
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
to determine if
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know if if you go into a room that
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
is supposed to just be an esthetician's
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
shop for example um where that's the
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
only thing supposed to be practiced is
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
within the scope of practice of an
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
esthetician and you find botox
 
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.430 align:start position:0%
esthetician and you find botox
um

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know the inspector finds botox that
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
would be an indication that that person
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
is very likely practicing outside their
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and we could
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
investigate further
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and i would like to point out the the
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
language does um
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know indicate that and i'm looking
 
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.669 align:start position:0%
you know indicate that and i'm looking
at

01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
this would be 313 b3 exemptions nothing
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
in this chapter shall be construed so as
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
to prohibit any individual license by
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
any regulatory board from performing
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
functions or duties within the scope of
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
such individuals license so if there is
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
an esthetician on staff who has a room
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is solely doing esthetician
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
that is solely doing esthetician
um

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
things that are within an esthetician
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
scope of practice that would be
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
since you have the nursing board the
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
medical board and the
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical board all in support
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
how would
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.390 align:start position:0%
how would
that

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
would your who would who would be
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
conducting the inspections on these
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
the inspectors would have all three
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
would have three
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
so for the inspectors
 
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
so for the inspectors
um

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
the the bill as as proposed would
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
allow the executive director to adopt
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
rules relative to the qualifications of
 
01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:38.070 align:start position:0%
rules relative to the qualifications of
inspectors

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that would need to be determined
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
we would likely need
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
somebody from the different
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise the different boards
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on what would be needed and
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
going into a medical spa because right
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
now we have pharmacy inspectors can go
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
in and do solely
 
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
in and do solely
pharmaceuticals

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
if there is an esthetician who has a
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
shop within a medical spa our barber and
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics inspectors
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
can go in but they are very limited they
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to it's only that shop they can't
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
go into other areas and look so it would
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
be somebody who would be qualified to
 
01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
be somebody who would be qualified to
um

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
so botox is a control substance is that
 
01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:27.510 align:start position:0%
so botox is a control substance is that
correct

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that so i'm
 
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.390 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that so i'm
asking

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain if it's a controlled
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
substance but you absolutely need a
 
01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:35.430 align:start position:0%
substance but you absolutely need a
prescription

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's a prescription you can't just buy
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns that had been
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
brought up by the board of pharmacology
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
they were noticing that
 
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.149 align:start position:0%
they were noticing that
botox

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
botox
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
vials were being used for more than one
 
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.390 align:start position:0%
vials were being used for more than one
person

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is a clear violation of
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
the administration of a
 
01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
the administration of a
pharmaceutical

01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out if there
 
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out if there
is

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
if an institution if for example
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
the um inspector were to find botox
 
01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
the um inspector were to find botox
there

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
why is it that the pharmaceut
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacology board would know that they
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the question
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
right so if there's a pers oh i see it
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
would be a prescription they'd have to
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
have a prescription to have the botox
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
and who would have issued that
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
subscription for somebody who isn't
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
licensed or
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
how does that work
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you would need to have the the proper
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
authorization to order botox um
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is there are people who
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
have gotten their hands on botox who are
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
not authorized i do not know how that
 
01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
not authorized i do not know how that
occurred

01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
but that is
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
so perhaps a point in the legislation
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
the access to botox has to be
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we should clarify that
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that if it's not if if prescription
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
products are being used
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna use the word illegal but
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
an unlawful
 
01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
an unlawful
um

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.709 align:start position:0%
um
process

01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
then that's also a violation i would
 
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.830 align:start position:0%
then that's also a violation i would
think

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
um that would that's right i i think it
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
could be clarified here um i think the
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
medical practice act and
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy um the statutes relating to
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy require that only certain
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals with certain
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
authorizations are able to
 
01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.110 align:start position:0%
authorizations are able to
um

01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know order prescription type
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
so it could be clarified here but i
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
think those statutes would require that
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'd also go for the i mean i
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
would imagine the fillers have to be
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
middle medical grade fillers i mean they
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
just can't be
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know anything really i don't
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
know i know very little about this but i
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
would imagine that that is also
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
something that's done by prescription
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding okay so we need
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
does that commit you any questions
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
no

01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:30.390 align:start position:0%
no
well

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
but would you put the name of botox
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
right in there or is it just to kind of
 
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.229 align:start position:0%
right in there or is it just to kind of
generally

01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's all kinds of crazy
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
things they do they have fish that
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
nibble on people and you know
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
you can't gonna list all the crazy
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
things they do right it's just if it
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
reaches the threshold of medical rather
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
than specifying botox or
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
right i i believe the barbering
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics um
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
forbids the use of animals and
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so there should no
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
longer be fish left in pedicures you had
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
heard of this i'm aware of i'm aware it
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
right so um
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
there may be a more general way of
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
phrasing it pharmaceutical or
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
something like that or an inject
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
anything injected
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
so i i want to come back to the issue of
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
medical directors
 
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.110 align:start position:0%
medical directors
um

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you can even put that in quotation
 
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.709 align:start position:0%
maybe you can even put that in quotation
marks

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
marks
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
because if they are just
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
as has been
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
stated previously
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're just selling their name
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
to some entity
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
and they they're not really engaged then
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
donald trump putting his name on a
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
building that that he has no involvement
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
with except his name he sold the name
 
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.750 align:start position:0%
with except his name he sold the name
rights

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.189 align:start position:0%
rights
um

01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't say anything about
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
but it it's misleading to the public in
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
to in in this kind of an instance what
 
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.510 align:start position:0%
to in in this kind of an instance what
he

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
what he's doing that example i gave
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's a different situation because
 
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.110 align:start position:0%
that's a different situation because
um

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
and he's not the architect he's not the
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
investor he's only selling the naming
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
rights it's a total different thing it's
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a branding situation
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
this person saying they are the medical
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
director but they ain't
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
except potentially legally i think we
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
have to of course
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
we would have to define what
 
01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
we would have to define what
available

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
remember you said earlier that they said
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
that and then you have to define what
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
medically available means with regard to
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
one of these people i'm very concerned
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
that that this is way too much of a wild
 
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
that that this is way too much of a wild
west

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
west
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
situation in new hampshire currently
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that you've got people
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
i gave the executive director an example
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we had in committee
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago before
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
not before any of you were born it
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't that long ago but
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
before some of you were around in the
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
state legislature or in oplc and so
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
forth and there was an example of this
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
couple that came into a
 
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
couple that came into a
mall

01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
mall
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
and there was somebody standing there
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
wearing a white coat and they were
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
offering free teeth whitening
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i said
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know typical
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
they look at each other they go like
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
kind of what could go wrong
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
and all of us who have been in the
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislature for a while well let me how
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
much time we got to tell you what could
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
go wrong
 
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.270 align:start position:0%
go wrong
because

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
we had pictures
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the husband brought
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
of his wife's inflamed lips and gums
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh from whatever substance they used
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
either too much of or the wrong stuff
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth and when you're
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
that is something that people are
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
extremely sensitive about men and women
 
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
extremely sensitive about men and women
um

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
and and so forth so you just can't have
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
that kind of a thing and these people
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
assume the white coat meant something
 
01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.229 align:start position:0%
assume the white coat meant something
medical

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
instead it meant some something more
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
like fraud
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
or incompetence so god knows what so
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
wild west
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
so i think we
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
especially the medical directors are
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
way more engagement
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
with the entity
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
that they that they are
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
stating they are the medical director of
 
01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
stating they are the medical director of
otherwise

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
be um
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i've heard some kind of reference
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
that some of these spas
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
are perhaps
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
renting their services
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
for like
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
bridal showers or wedding parties or so
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
forth and so on
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
now you're having procedures performed
 
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.709 align:start position:0%
now you're having procedures performed
at

01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and if any kind of a mistake is made
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and parties perhaps there might be
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol consumed
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
by some of the people at some of these
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
parties and so forth this is just an
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
invitation in my judgment to abuse and
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
and reckless endangerment of the public
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see much more
 
01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.310 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see much more
um

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
specification about medical
 
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.390 align:start position:0%
specification about medical
directors

01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
directors
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
required engagement with the entity that
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
they are directing
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be my feeling thank you
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
may i respond briefly
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
um so i i agree with you um the proposed
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislation did
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
define what a medical director was who
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
that person could be in terms of
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
qualifications and what the requirements
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
would be for that type of person
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's in there and i i do
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
agree there's probably a lot of medical
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
spas who might be doing things right um
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to some of some
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys who represent
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
such spas and they basically say this
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
codifies everything they're doing right
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
so for those those institutions i don't
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
think this would have that big an impact
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
but there are those that a doctor sells
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
their name to it gives the appearance of
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
a medical director when in fact there
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
is there anything in existing statute
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
that parallels this or something that
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
you have to say that he's a he
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
participates or that he has oversight or
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
is there some kind of way to address
 
01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.149 align:start position:0%
is there some kind of way to address
that

01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:26.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not i looked at some other i tried
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
to try to find some other legislation
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
that might be similar especially in
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
other new england states
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
and didn't find anything sort of on
 
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
and didn't find anything sort of on
point

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
for example connecticut
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
does have a statute but it's much more
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive because it requires
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
a physician physician assistant or an
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
aprn not only diagnosed but actually do
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
all the treatments
 
01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
all the treatments
um

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
so it was i was unable to in the
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
research i i conducted find something on
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
point for what were precisely what we're
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
looking to do here um so that language
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
thought might be
 
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
thought might be
two

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is too complicated but to
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
change the
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
nomenclature from medical spa
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
to medical cosmetics
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering whether or not the
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
word spa
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
is causing the because people think of
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know the place that you can go and
 
01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
you know the place that you can go and
have

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
a sauna and a massage and i mean that's
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's a spa right but this is medical
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and i'm wondering whether or
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
not we should think about
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
defining it
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
out of the spa realm so that people
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
understand it better
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
is that that makes sense
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think that does make sense i think the
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
use of the word spa sometimes does
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
create confusion
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be something that we might
 
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.550 align:start position:0%
so that would be something that we might
consider

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
because i think that makes it more when
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
you say you know medical cosmetology
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
that brings i mean that to me in my head
 
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
that brings i mean that to me in my head
brings

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
brings
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
some alarm bells right because you're
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
a facial or
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
a my appeal or whatever right
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
i just think i want to pick up on that
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
recent colloquy with regard to the word
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
spa because
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's a word that everybody knows
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
and everybody has a different definition
 
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
and everybody has a different definition
of

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and to the degree that you're you're
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
making money off of the term
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to have to have
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
much more definition i think of what
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
what spa means
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
especially in regard to this particular
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
category that we're talking about here
 
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
category that we're talking about here
so

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i have you rece you've mentioned
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
connecticut have you researched some
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
other states massachusetts
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
is even closer to us of course and much
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
more interaction with connect than with
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire than connecticut has
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
right um i did
 
01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
right um i did
do

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
some research on the new england states
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
i provided a letter it was dated january
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
24th to house edna regarding regarding
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
that but and i have a copy here if you
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
you'd like it
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts requires a medical spas be
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
licensed with the department of public
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
health in that state in that state they
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
oversee the medical boards
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why that entity is um where
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
the license where the medical spas have
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be licensed
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
they do require licensure unless it
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
falls into the exception for entities
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
which are wholly owned and controlled by
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
one or more of its medical practitioners
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
and does not use certain terms in its
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
name such as clinic or institute so
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
if it's not wholly owned by a medical
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
professional they have to be licensed in
 
01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
professional they have to be licensed in
massachusetts

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it appears that the
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're looking at
 
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.709 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're looking at
is

01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
strictly aimed at
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and this is a good
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
first step
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
yes um and if i may point out one other
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
difference with massachusetts that was
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
licensure what we were proposing was a
 
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.550 align:start position:0%
licensure what we were proposing was a
registration

01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
we still are proposing that
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a licensure
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
how would that differ as far as
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
or are we saying if they're registering
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
they that they are
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
agreeing okay
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
so generally under um administrative
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
laws registration and licensure are
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
treated the same for legal purposes
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
except that there is a distinction which
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think is important for our purposes
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to this legislation
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
registration there's generally no
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
discretion as to whether to place you on
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
the registry the qualifications are not
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
substantial it's uh you've paid the fee
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and you get on the list
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
um versus what we see and that's very
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
similar to the med tech registry
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
somebody says that they are around
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
controlled substances they pay the fee
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
they get on the list
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a license to practice
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
nursing uh we need your transcripts we
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
need your references we need your
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
criminal history check and all of all of
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
those requirements so
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
the reason why we
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
we sought to establish the registry
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
the the bill is proposed really just
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
clarified the existing state of the law
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire which is that if you're
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
performing a medical procedure
 
01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.189 align:start position:0%
performing a medical procedure
um

01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be a diagnosis not
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
that it's medically indicated but that
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are no contraindications and the
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
only people who can make that diagnosis
 
01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
only people who can make that diagnosis
are

01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
an mddo or pa under the supervision of
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
an mddo or an aprn and then they could
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
certainly delegate those tasks and what
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
we have and that's the existing state of
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
but it's unclear
 
01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.350 align:start position:0%
but it's unclear
and

01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not explicitly stated
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere and there is a lot of
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
overlap and confusion between medical
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
procedures and cosmetic procedures
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and we
 
01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
um and we
this

01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill came about rather organically
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
because we were receiving complaints
 
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.470 align:start position:0%
because we were receiving complaints
um

01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
about people who had been injured
 
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.310 align:start position:0%
about people who had been injured
from

01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who were not qualified a
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
prime example being one complaint was
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
that a licensed nursing assistant had
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
whipped up some
 
01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
whipped up some
uh

01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
facial cream or was it a chemical peel
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and was was it
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
advising people via telehealth how to
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
administer the chemical peel
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
completely outside the scope of what
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to do but because it's
 
01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to do but because it's
cosmetic

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetic
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
they felt that it was appropriate we had
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
another individual who was injured with
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
laser therapy
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
and this wasn't laser that was just
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
going just below the surface it goes
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
fairly deep and they're permanently
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
scarred because
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
the person didn't assess they were not
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
qualified to assess whether laser was
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate on that individual
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
nor did they have supervision
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
from a qualified person so they were
 
01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
from a qualified person so they were
permanently

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
disfigured so you know i think the bill
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
would propose the existing or would
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
clarify the existing state of the law
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to scope of practice but
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
then it also allows us to ensure
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
compliance through the registration and
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
the inspections
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i don't think it's
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
that intrusive because individuals who
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
practice in this field generally are
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
subject to inspections
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
and um there are no additional
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
requirements that one has to
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
meet in order to have a medical uh
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
whatever we would like to call it but
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with you your comments
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
because registration i mean we have you
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
know your highest level is licensing
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
where it's something where you have to
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
have qualifications
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh you're subject to
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
revocation suspension
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh and so forth uh certification is a
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
lower level uh it says you know how to
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.229 align:start position:0%
do something
um

01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
and and uh of course the the terms have
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.390 align:start position:0%
have uh
like

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
the term rn
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
is registered nurse and it's a
 
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.790 align:start position:0%
is registered nurse and it's a
traditional

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
term right
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
but in point of fact right rns are all
 
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
but in point of fact right rns are all
licensed

01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
licensed
and

01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so and you have certified public
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
accountants i think they're also
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
licensed even though they're called cpa
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a traditional
 
01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
because it's a traditional
title

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
title
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of i shouldn't say a
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
lot but it certainly is a considerable
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
amount of overlap so it it's not
 
01:32:56.159 --> 01:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
amount of overlap so it it's not
strictly

01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
strictly
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
delineated from one to the other but
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
registration is
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
pretty weak t in my view
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
for some for an entity that is going to
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
if i may um the registration would just
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
give us authority to inspect and if
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
there were
findings

01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
findings
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
then we would refer those out to the
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
different regulatory boards
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
what we've observed is that
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know as jessica explained
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetology pharmacy um
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
and at the other inspect inspections
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
they they all operate in their own
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
little silo there's no one
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
person that can look at everything and
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
overlap between
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
these different professions so we wanted
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to go in and look at
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
everything and then refer out to the
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulatory body if there was
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
so miss courtney in relationship to the
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
previous bill um
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
you would be writing the rules for that
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislation we need a motion to
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you think the recommendation
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the motion should be i'm happy to move
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
that because i absolutely don't want to
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
see this be
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be the wild west that it is
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
becoming the wilder west
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislation or statutory
 
01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislation or statutory
authority

01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.109 align:start position:0%
authority
so

01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative bailey seconds
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
i will call the role representative
 
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
i will call the role representative
schmidt

01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative grotto votes yes those
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
three to zero to recommend for future
 
01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.669 align:start position:0%
three to zero to recommend for future
legislation

01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
and are there any other
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
topics or questions or comments if not i
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
close the hear the subcommittee work
 
01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
close the hear the subcommittee work
session

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the um you all and i
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to thank the committee members for
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of thought
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
and making these work sessions
 
03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
clock

03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
we'll just wait for a few minutes for uh
 
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows to to get back
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
and see if representative rhodes shows
 
03:02:27.359 --> 03:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
and see if representative rhodes shows
up

03:02:30.630 --> 03:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i heard it's myself roads
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
and fellows but as long as we have two
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
people we can
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to call this subcommittee
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
work session on house bill 1312 to order
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like to call mr sherman if you
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
could come up we were talking earlier
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
and he can give you his views on this
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
i think uh we have two issues with hp
 
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
1312 as it stood
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
one is that it directly conflicts with
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
155a which is the enabling rsa for the
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
building code and then it's the building
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
which prohibits
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies from amending the
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that with des there was
 
03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
understanding that with des there was
some

03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
some
uh

03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'll call confusion in a gentlemanly way
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
as to where the building code applied
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
and did not apply we can sort that out
 
03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
we feel we're on pretty firm ground
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
having talked to people who have been
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
around a lot longer than i have
 
03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
around a lot longer than i have
so

03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
just that on the face of it would say
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
1312 hopefully will
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
die a quick death
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
i believe we have legislation in place
 
03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
155 a 2x
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
which permits state agencies to come to
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
the building code review board amend the
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
as as they would desire and get reviewed
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes a state amendment
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
applicable to everyone
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
we in no way shape or form are trying to
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
cut anybody out of looking at grease
 
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
traps half the towns in the state don't
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
have a building inspector so obviously
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know there's got to be a working
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
together there so i think that uh in
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the specific rules
 
03:04:55.359 --> 03:04:56.230 align:start position:0%
terms of the specific rules
uh

03:04:56.230 --> 03:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
what we really need is some time and it
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
may be extensive time as i indicated in
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
my email the other day a very quick
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
cursory look at rules among different
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and departments
 
03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that that's endemic
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
dhhs doe almost everybody seems to have
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
a rule at some point
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
that effectively amends the building
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
code without calling it amendment to the
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that would seem to conflict with the
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
current rsa as it stands
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
as i indicated mr leckus earlier i
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe we've got some editorial work to
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
do on our rsa in the next year or two
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
just to clarify some terminology but the
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
intent seems to be very clear and in
 
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
fact has been enforced over the years
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
notably with a
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
discussion with some elevator folks at
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
one point
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
so what i'm here today
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
in hope of is some kind of an interim
 
03:05:57.520 --> 03:05:58.389 align:start position:0%
in hope of is some kind of an interim
way

03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
to allow us some time to work in a in a
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated manner with the various
 
03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:04.870 align:start position:0%
coordinated manner with the various
agencies

03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be through gel car or
 
03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be through gel car or
otherwise

03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh to to figure out where all of these
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
things are popping up in the in the
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
various rsas and the rules
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
and then get them resolved through
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh and to not have uh an rsa that sort
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
of sits over here that says well des can
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
write rules on their own that amend the
 
03:06:29.429 --> 03:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
building code that now we've got a
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
direct conflict between two two sections
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
right and i would think that i mean you
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
said that you could incorporate those
 
03:06:37.030 --> 03:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
rules in the building code but i would
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
think you know as part of the review
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
board you look at and see is that really
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and necessary and some of
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
them it may be
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them to go ahead with
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
most things in life there are 17 members
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
on the building code review board
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have an opinion
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
about something
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
um i think reflecting also on a comment
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
that was made back at the hearing
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh that does start with a model code and
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
then amends that model code where
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's a need to amend it uh
 
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
rather than leaving the model code in
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with local state rules
 
03:07:12.399 --> 03:07:13.750 align:start position:0%
conflict with local state rules
um

03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
if you'll be available for questions
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely after this what i'd like to
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
do is get a representative from
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:23.190 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
gonna to

03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
gonna to
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
which i sent to
 
03:07:36.319 --> 03:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
which i sent to
um

03:07:55.110 --> 03:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
all right so good afternoon uh for the
 
03:07:58.560 --> 03:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
all right so good afternoon uh for the
record

03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
record
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
my name is philip trobridge i'm the
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
manager of the land resource programs at
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
des which includes the subsurface
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
systems bureau which is where the
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding grease traps
 
03:08:11.279 --> 03:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding grease traps
reside

03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
and what i just handed to you was some
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
information that i provided to
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
ols um i think probably i didn't know if
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
it was passed on to you all but you know
 
03:08:22.479 --> 03:08:23.190 align:start position:0%
it was passed on to you all but you know
from

03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh he had asked for some
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
clarifications of our regulations
 
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
regarding grease traps and
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh and under what circumstances we could
 
03:08:33.429 --> 03:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
waive those regulations
 
03:08:33.439 --> 03:08:34.469 align:start position:0%
waive those regulations
um

03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
because i think it's one thing if you
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
look at page two
 
03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:40.230 align:start position:0%
look at page two
um

03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know we we have the ability to
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
to make waivers whenever uh it's
 
03:08:45.279 --> 03:08:46.710 align:start position:0%
to make waivers whenever uh it's
justified

03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
justified
 
03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
justified
and

03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you know waive the requirement for
 
03:08:54.309 --> 03:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
things like grease traps
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
um under circumstances that are pretty
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
well defined when there is you know a
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
food establishment where there's not
 
03:09:03.110 --> 03:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to be very much grease
 
03:09:05.670 --> 03:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know whether there's seeding or not
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's high water high temperature
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
dishwashers which tends to mobilize
 
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
grease and those kinds of things
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so i just bring this up to you know in
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
the i guess in the context of the
 
03:09:17.359 --> 03:09:18.150 align:start position:0%
the i guess in the context of the
uh

03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
that the desire for house bill 1312
 
03:09:21.439 --> 03:09:22.229 align:start position:0%
that the desire for house bill 1312
um

03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
seeks some flexibility
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the sizing and the requirements
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
for grease traps
 
03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
for grease traps
um

03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted you all to be aware that we we
 
03:09:33.429 --> 03:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
have that flexibility now in our current
 
03:09:33.439 --> 03:09:34.309 align:start position:0%
have that flexibility now in our current
rules

03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh and we exercise it currently so i
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
have kind of a more basic question and
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned in
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
rsa155a2 it says no state agency
 
03:09:47.670 --> 03:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
authority board or commission shall very
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
modify or waive the requirements the
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
state building code or the state fire
 
03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:52.309 align:start position:0%
state building code or the state fire
code

03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:09:52.319 --> 03:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
code
um

03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
unless approved by the state building
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
code review board and so the question is
 
03:09:58.640 --> 03:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
code review board and so the question is
um

03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
was this rule uh passed by the state
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and was
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
it approved by them
 
03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
because it does impinge i would argue on
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of the building code
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh well the grease traps that we require
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
under our regulations are outside the
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
building so they are you know different
 
03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the jurisdiction of the building
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
code which would be inside the building
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so there are these you know smaller
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
interior grease traps
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and those those relate to plumbing
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
codes and things like that
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
the the build the grease traps for
 
03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
under the subsurface system rules are
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
external they're they're basically part
 
03:10:40.950 --> 03:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the septic system okay there seems to
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
be some dispute on that point actually
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
if mr sherman could come back you seem
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.229 --> 03:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
yeah you can both sit at the table
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
actually or sit there at that table
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably is best given that i assume
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
this is being uh recorded given my
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
number of friends with cove it will keep
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit of distance
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i understand fully and we have not
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
had a chance to coordinate this and have
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
a discussion about it but uh the the
 
03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
building code in this case we're talking
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
about the plumbing code
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
is absolutely clear and i've reviewed
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
this with others that our jurisdiction
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
goes to either the public sewer or the
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
septic tank they call it a building
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
sewer whatever goes across the front
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
yard is still within
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
the building codes baileywick so the
 
03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue of insider outside matters on
 
03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
other things but it doesn't really
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
matter to which code applies
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have a discussion about that
 
03:11:49.110 --> 03:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
we need to work together and zip zip
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
these two things together somehow
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
sure okay i mean that's excellent point
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it's come up in other contexts too
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know where the the line is for
 
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh septic system jurisdiction you know
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
we've typically operated of
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
assuming five feet from the
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
building foundation
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
but you know i think if there's any
 
03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
ambiguity we should clear that up one
 
03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that there's
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
continual confusion is that the plumbing
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
licensing does not does not align with
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
so the plumbing licensing stops some
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
distance outside the building foundation
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
which was set basically due to the
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
length of a piece of pipe
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that continually comes up as a point
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
of confusion
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
but the code itself goes all the way to
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you i'm
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
just a little confused about this i
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the international plumbing code which is
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
the basic part of the state's code and
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
then we amend
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
make amendments to it
 
03:12:58.319 --> 03:12:59.269 align:start position:0%
make amendments to it
and

03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
what i found there
 
03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
what i found there
um

03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
matched what i found when i just googled
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
grease traps
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:13:08.239 --> 03:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
and i
and

03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
the code
 
03:13:12.550 --> 03:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
how what kind and how much of a grease
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
trap with the capacity of the grease
 
03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
trap with the capacity of the grease
trap

03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
trap
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
is a function of
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
the flow
 
03:13:25.030 --> 03:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
of water into
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
flow going uh from whatever sink or
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment you're dealing with
 
03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:34.710 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment you're dealing with
and

03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
there certainly are grease traps that
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
can reside inside the kitchen not even
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
just the building but the kitchen
 
03:13:45.830 --> 03:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody were
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
following the code
 
03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
following the code
that

03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
in the particular case we heard about
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that
 
03:13:57.200 --> 03:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that
the

03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:13:58.000 --> 03:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
the
a

03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
licensed designer of septic
 
03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:03.190 align:start position:0%
licensed designer of septic
whatever

03:14:03.190 --> 03:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
whatever
um

03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:05.269 align:start position:0%
um
could

03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
easily say that
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
small restaurant
 
03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
which is certainly
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
the case that we heard about certainly
 
03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
the case that we heard about certainly
was

03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:17.269 align:start position:0%
was
that

03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:19.590 --> 03:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
an outside grease trap probably wasn't
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
even necessary so this is i i'm not a
 
03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
plumber so that's what i found
 
03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:26.309 align:start position:0%
plumber so that's what i found
so

03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that and tell me did
 
03:14:31.750 --> 03:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
i get it wrong or am i missing something
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
or is something else out of line
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
no i can't
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh my technical expertise has nothing to
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
do with grease traps i'm a fire
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
protection engineer
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm the chair of the building code
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
review board and on that board we have
 
03:14:48.550 --> 03:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
others whose expertise is plumbing and
 
03:14:51.750 --> 03:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
related related issues so that's why i'm
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
saying i think we need the time to have
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
a conversation and see how we can zip
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
these things together do the appropriate
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
amendments to the state code where there
 
03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
is overlap
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
and then have people able to look at one
 
03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:05.910 align:start position:0%
and then have people able to look at one
document

03:15:05.910 --> 03:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know in an ideal world the rules on
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
grease traps would say comply with the
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
state building code as they do in other
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
other rules for other purposes
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay i think
 
03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess i could respond a little
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
bit to your question um yeah and i i
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
think you're you know
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
read is essentially correct it's but
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little there's other elements to
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
it in terms of you know the uh
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
the type of food that's being cooked and
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
the type of appliances that are in the
 
03:15:35.439 --> 03:15:36.550 align:start position:0%
the type of appliances that are in the
facility

03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:15:38.950 --> 03:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the number of customers and whether
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's uh you know restroom facilities
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
or it's just a takeout facility so
 
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
the uh there's kind of a calculation you
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
can make essentially of the amount of
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
grease that might be generated
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
and then therefore
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of storage or you know the
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
size of the grease trap that's needed
 
03:15:59.429 --> 03:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that's also related to the frequency
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
in which you'd want to have that you
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
know disposed of
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
so it it's you know these all can be
 
03:16:06.399 --> 03:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
so it it's you know these all can be
sized

03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
sized
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know scaled in whatever way
 
03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
it works but they
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
it has to be done as a you know in an
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
integrated fashion where someone is
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
thinking carefully about well if i want
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
to have a small grease strap i really
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
need to have this pump out truck come
 
03:16:22.399 --> 03:16:23.349 align:start position:0%
need to have this pump out truck come
every

03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:16:25.269 --> 03:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
week or every you know a couple of days
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
and do i want is that worth the payment
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
for the cost to do that
 
03:16:29.439 --> 03:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
for the cost to do that
so

03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
you know it can be you know the grease
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
can be managed with any different sizes
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
but it comes down to kind of like what's
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
the most efficient way of doing it
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i agree that there's i guess um
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
with the sentiment that we should spend
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
a little time thinking about it and how
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
we could structure this in a way
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
that is easier for people to understand
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
um and right now we you know we use some
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
discretion when we encounter a facility
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a fry later it doesn't
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
have a high temperature dishwasher and
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and we can say yeah
 
03:17:04.950 --> 03:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
we can waive the requirement
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
for the for the external grease trap
 
03:17:09.830 --> 03:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
but you know perhaps there's a way that
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
that can be more clearly articulated in
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
rule or in the plumbing code
 
03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:16.710 align:start position:0%
rule or in the plumbing code
follow-up

03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
my thought is the way that somebody
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
would move forward with
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
a new small restaurant or some kind of
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of an existing one
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that they would
 
03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
be contacting somebody who has a license
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:38.389 align:start position:0%
to do
design

03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
design
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
related to grease traps and i don't know
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
who that is i don't know if that's a
 
03:17:43.990 --> 03:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
regular plumber or somebody with a
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
special license
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that they would
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
present they would develop the design
 
03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:50.950 align:start position:0%
present they would develop the design
and

03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
present it to the state and
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sick i don't know if people can hear
 
03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm talking sideways um
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
accept that design i don't even really
 
03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:05.030 align:start position:0%
accept that design i don't even really
understand

03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:18:06.870 --> 03:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
why the state would be doing anything
 
03:18:10.710 --> 03:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially what we do you
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
know we you know people come to us for
 
03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know a septic system approval
 
03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
and then part of that design for the
 
03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
sepsis and would include a grease trap
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
if it's a food establishment
 
03:18:24.630 --> 03:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
and unless you know they can make the
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
case that this is you know a low grease
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
generating facility and therefore we're
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to seek a waiver
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
for that grease trap
 
03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know and so we review that plan and
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
then we approve that plan and then
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's constructed according to the
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
approved plan
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
so that's the process we use now
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah hang on i'll get to
 
03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:47.349 align:start position:0%
okay yeah hang on i'll get to
um

03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have representative aaron talk
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
about this particular case but as i
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
understand it um
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on grease traps or
 
03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on grease traps or
plumbing

03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
but it seemed pretty clear that what was
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
being demanded was over the top and you
 
03:19:03.269 --> 03:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
can say you have discretion and that's
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
great if it's exercised reasonably
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
and again it appears to me i'm not an
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
expert it appears to me that was not the
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
case this time and that's what raised
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:19:16.389 --> 03:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
if nothing else the decision was drug
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
out long enough that
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
people are concerned actually ended up
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
having to put the grease trap in
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
to operate their business
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so you know that is a serious
 
03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
and so you know that is a serious
concern

03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
also i think it's pretty clear and maybe
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
we can clarify 155a2
 
03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
we can clarify 155a2
that

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know des cannot be putting in rules
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
that impinge on the area covered by
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state building code and maybe
 
03:19:45.429 --> 03:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
there's a misunderstanding about that
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
about where that boundary was in
 
03:19:49.349 --> 03:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
different cases and and you know it's
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
great if there's some communication
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
going on to clarify that that would be
 
03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:54.469 align:start position:0%
going on to clarify that that would be
good

03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.190 --> 03:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative likus um
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah what you described mr trewbridge
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
in in terms of how
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
things are supposed to work was not what
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
happened and
 
03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
and i would say that this is not the
 
03:20:13.439 --> 03:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
and i would say that this is not the
only

03:20:15.030 --> 03:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine that this has
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
occurred with because there have been
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
other issues other times when other
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
businesses have
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
have come across the same kind of
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
problem but for my constituent
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
balthazars in goshen
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
they were featured on chronicles and
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
then the very next day
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
an inspector came down to their place
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
and closed them down because they said
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
they did not have the proper size grease
 
03:20:47.120 --> 03:20:47.990 align:start position:0%
they did not have the proper size grease
trap

03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
trap
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
now they had already gotten a license
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
they were already licensed to do the
 
03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
work they were doing
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden this issue comes up
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that they need this thousand gallon
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there was any kind
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.439 --> 03:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
waiver

03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
explained to them or any kind of
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
situation where they would have had
 
03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
any way in which to modify what d s was
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
telling them they needed in order to
 
03:21:21.269 --> 03:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
keep their license
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
they were just told you have to put in a
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon grease trap otherwise
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
you lose your license and we have to
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
shut you down
 
03:21:27.680 --> 03:21:29.269 align:start position:0%
shut you down
so

03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
what are they supposed to do
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they went ahead and they spent
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to have this system
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
installed which is
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
way more than what they would ever need
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
for the type of work uh type of food
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
that they produce
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
the shed that they that they
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
scoop their food out of
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
is is just about the same size as the
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
grease trap that they installed so i
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
mean how could you even think that or
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
how could even how could des even think
 
03:21:57.520 --> 03:21:58.309 align:start position:0%
how could even how could des even think
that

03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallon grease trap well one
 
03:22:03.190 --> 03:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
size fits all situation
 
03:22:05.910 --> 03:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate in this way i
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
would like to respond yeah it just
 
03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:12.870 align:start position:0%
would like to respond yeah it just
briefly

03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
i i believe in this particular case
 
03:22:16.870 --> 03:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
there was a change in their menu and so
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
their original design that they were
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
approved for was
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think just ice cream and then
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know they expanded to
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
um some you know other types of foods
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
so which triggered the
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
the you know whereas before the the
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
grease trap is not needed for just
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
scooping ice cream um
 
03:22:38.479 --> 03:22:39.349 align:start position:0%
scooping ice cream um
and

03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
then if you're going to fried foods then
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where the threshold for
 
03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
us you know we've
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh to say well this is now you're now
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
into a situation where you need that and
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
we do have you know the rules just say
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's a thousand gallons so it means that
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a an option of sort of
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
scaling it and saying okay
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
your facility is just
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
only doing
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know french fries and therefore you
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
can have a 500 gallon tank you know it's
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
you're either in or you're out
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what happened in this
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
case um so i think that that was one of
 
03:23:12.150 --> 03:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
as far as i understand
 
03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of grease that they would
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
have produced with the enhanced
 
03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.670 align:start position:0%
have produced with the enhanced
menu

03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
menu
 
03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
was not even an issue because all their
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
fry laters were self-contained they
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
weren't dumping any of that down the
 
03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:33.349 align:start position:0%
weren't dumping any of that down the
sink

03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
sink
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
and they had
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
all the food that they serve is on
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
disposable plates so it's not like
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're cleaning any of that in a
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
dishwasher so
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
even any minimal amount
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
of grease that they would be producing
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
putting on utensils that they use in
 
03:23:52.309 --> 03:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
their establishment
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
would no way
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
need a thousand gallon grease trap
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
an under the sink grease trap would be
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this kind of
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
establishment and that's what other
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
plumbers uh
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
and experts in the field had had advised
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
but again you have no way in which to uh
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
say in this case you can have
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
a 500 gallon grease trap or a 200 gallon
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
grease or whatever
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
so and i think and and i had written to
 
03:24:22.319 --> 03:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
so and i think and and i had written to
um

03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
asking him for
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
a change in the rules and basically
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
was told
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it so
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
i hope you look at it right and the uh
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
there was a that information i was
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
passed passing out earlier just saying
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know the areas where we could
 
03:24:42.479 --> 03:24:43.429 align:start position:0%
you know the areas where we could
consider

03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
us either a smaller system or no system
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
is is kind of our as i've been pressing
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
staff to say well under you know what
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
are our thresholds for this you know and
 
03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that are clear for us to decide because
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're not
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
um you know equipped to go out and
 
03:24:58.319 --> 03:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
um you know equipped to go out and
really

03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
dig into exactly how many customers does
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
somebody have and you know of what type
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
of meal do they make
 
03:25:06.309 --> 03:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's more you know do they have a fry
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
later you know do they have a high
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
temperature dishwasher you know do they
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
have seating uh do they use paper
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
service or china service so those were
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
the kind of black and white thresholds
 
03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
the kind of black and white thresholds
we're

03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:25:20.229 --> 03:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
using to say we could you we could put
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
something like this in rule because it's
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
black and white and it's easy for us to
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate on a plan
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and and that would allow us to be
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
communicate to people clearly like in
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
those circumstances we can waive this
 
03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
those circumstances we can waive this
role

03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
role
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
or we could have a lower tier
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
authorization for under the under the
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
sink restrap
 
03:25:41.349 --> 03:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
but you know that's the the effort
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
spawned by your letter was to come up
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
with some black and white thresholds
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we could use either for waivers or
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
for a change in the rule so my my
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
understanding and people can correct me
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
if it's wrong is that
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
um it's actually inappropriate for des
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
to have created rules in this area at
 
03:25:58.239 --> 03:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
to have created rules in this area at
all

03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
unless they had first gone and gotten it
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the building code review
 
03:26:05.110 --> 03:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
board i don't know
 
03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:06.790 align:start position:0%
board i don't know
um

03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
what the national plumbing code part as
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
amended by new hampshire that's uh
 
03:26:13.190 --> 03:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
state building code i don't know
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
what it says in this specific area it
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:26:18.640 --> 03:26:20.389 align:start position:0%
may have
more

03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
rules that will come accommodate
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
different situations but i think this
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
rule is actually invalid under statute
 
03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
rule is actually invalid under statute
completely

03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
completely
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
because it didn't follow the process
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
required in statute and i don't know
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
you said you're not an expert on grace
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
traps do you happen to know if
 
03:26:39.429 --> 03:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
there is something more flexible that's
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
part of the npc
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
oh i'll catch you in a moment
 
03:26:46.150 --> 03:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
what is very clear as as we get into
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
this whole discussion is that in any of
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
the rules there may be a piece of it
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
that overlaps with the plumbing code
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
while much of the rest of it doesn't
 
03:26:55.760 --> 03:26:56.469 align:start position:0%
while much of the rest of it doesn't
yeah

03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's also a
 
03:26:58.160 --> 03:26:59.349 align:start position:0%
there's also a
very

03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
common regulatory problem where
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
designing something based on what
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
somebody says they're going to do when
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
they operate the building is always like
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
catching butterflies
 
03:27:11.670 --> 03:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
right i promise we're never going to
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
sell cheeseburgers only hamburgers well
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
who enforces that
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
and even when we talk about the issue of
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
waivers between the rule
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
the des rules and the building code
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the jurisdictions that don't have a
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
building inspector who does the waiver
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
if it's in the building code so there's
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of these issues that really need
 
03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
thoughtful consideration and zipping
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
together before we jump
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh my opinion okay one thing is if
 
03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
you're not actually speaking please turn
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
the mics off because only so many can be
 
03:27:42.640 --> 03:27:43.429 align:start position:0%
the mics off because only so many can be
on

03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
and there's a gentleman here i think
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.349 --> 03:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon for the record i'm
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
rainey pelletier i'm the
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
director of the water division at des of
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
which uh one of the programs that's
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
under my purview if you will is on-site
 
03:28:06.239 --> 03:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
under my purview if you will is on-site
wastewater

03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
wastewater
 
03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:08.550 align:start position:0%
wastewater
so

03:28:08.550 --> 03:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
what i will try and do is add some
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
clarity to i think what is
 
03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
clarity to i think what is
uh

03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:17.110 --> 03:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion by
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of us
 
03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:19.510 align:start position:0%
a lot of us
the

03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
first of all the plumbing code has
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what a structure has
 
03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to discharge the state's
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
groundwaters of the state
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing code or building codes designed
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to install this that or
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that there's an
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate approach in the technologies
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
and the method that you use
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
when we did rules and i've been at des
 
03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
when we did rules and i've been at des
forever

03:28:47.190 --> 03:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
forever
 
03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i was in the subsurface program back
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
in 73
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
in 67 is when the subsurface rules came
 
03:28:54.640 --> 03:28:55.670 align:start position:0%
in 67 is when the subsurface rules came
in

03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
back in the days when
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
we dealt with the plumbing board
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
because we license pump installers we
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
license waste water and drinking water
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
operators and so forth and so on
 
03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:09.670 align:start position:0%
operators and so forth and so on
so

03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
the confusion here is that the the
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
building code has no idea or no control
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
over what is coming out of a structure
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
from a wastewater point of view that is
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
certainly under des purview
 
03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
so when we go in and we say you require
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
a grease trap or we approve a septic
 
03:29:29.279 --> 03:29:30.469 align:start position:0%
a grease trap or we approve a septic
system

03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
then it's based on what the quantity
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the quality of the waste water that
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
will come out of that structure and go
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
into the ground which is on the onsite
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater septic system
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
when this particular situation came in
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was an approved septic system
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
which in fact no way alluded to the fact
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
there was going to be fryer laters
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
grease traps any other issues
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
that took place it's like
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
saying that it is not uncommon people
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
come in we approve a septic system for
 
03:30:04.950 --> 03:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms three years down the road
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
we get a phone call from the building
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
inspecting and saying hey there's
 
03:30:08.950 --> 03:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
another bedroom
 
03:30:11.190 --> 03:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
so we can ultimately number one i don't
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
have the staff to go out and see what
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
people are doing most of the time unless
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
we get a complaint
 
03:30:18.080 --> 03:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
we get a complaint
but

03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to be very clear that the
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
building code
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
and what is state approved for
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
discharging wastewater to the ground a
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
two different purviews
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
very different
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
so the plumbing cord does not dictate
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of waste water should be
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
approved to come out of a structure
 
03:30:40.319 --> 03:30:42.229 align:start position:0%
approved to come out of a structure
so

03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
i would disagree that in fact our rules
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
went in place
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
neglecting the statute of the building
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.630 --> 03:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
so let me see if i can
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm putting the pieces together right
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
here i'm trying
 
03:31:04.319 --> 03:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
here i'm trying
so

03:31:05.190 --> 03:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying that your purview
 
03:31:11.190 --> 03:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
is to be able to say
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
no grease should be flowing
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
out into the ground or
 
03:31:17.439 --> 03:31:18.469 align:start position:0%
out into the ground or
a

03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
brook or whatever okay
 
03:31:21.359 --> 03:31:22.550 align:start position:0%
brook or whatever okay
but

03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:31:25.269 --> 03:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
what gives you the authority
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
to determine how
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
how that is managed because there are
 
03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
grease traps that can be inside the
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
building and there are grease traps that
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
can be outside the building and there
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
are plumbing codes
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that relate to grease traps that say
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
what size of trap you need
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
good question and first of all whatever
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
gets discharged to the ground in the
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
surface waters of hopefully nothing to
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
the surface waters but the wastewater
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
system is under the purview of des
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is the regulatory authority we have
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
under 485
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
which in fact does control what kind of
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
waste is discharged
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
in the building code or the plumber's
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
code they in fact would certainly have
 
03:32:19.030 --> 03:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
a grease trap
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
but as far as the determination of what
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
the volume the quality of the waste
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
water is
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to be discharged to
 
03:32:31.990 --> 03:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
the environment is not part of the
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
plumbing code preview
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
they deal with the mechanics of the
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
sizing they deal with the mechanics of
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
how it's plumbed just like they do if
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're putting a well tank in your house
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the plumbing code does in
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
the building code
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
but when you get to the world of
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater discharge
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
that is not in any way shape or form in
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
the purview under a building code
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
towns in their building code can have
 
03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
towns in their building code can have
stricter

03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
stricter
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
stricter regulations but they have to
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
meet the minimum standards of what's
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
statutorily approved by statute and rule
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay um mr just mr sherman can you
 
03:33:20.880 --> 03:33:21.670 align:start position:0%
okay um mr just mr sherman can you
help

03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
with this i mean is it true that the
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
building could
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
the problem is it seems that
 
03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
there are issues that
 
03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
there are issues that
um

03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know both involve the building code
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe some things that ds has
 
03:33:36.150 --> 03:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
authority over that's not part of the
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
building code and
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
how can this
 
03:33:40.100 --> 03:33:40.110 align:start position:0%
get sorted out
 
03:33:40.110 --> 03:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
get sorted out
[Music]

03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
give us some time to talk about it
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
a grease interceptor automatic grease
 
03:33:49.110 --> 03:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
removal device shall be required to
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
receive the drainage blah blah blah blah
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
blah in food preparation areas such as
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants hotel kitchens hospitals and
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
on it goes so clearly the plumbing code
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
addresses this issue
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
des may well
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
flush things out in more detail and have
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
operational procedures that are not part
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
of the of the plumbing code they take a
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
fairly broad swath at this and say if
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're running a restaurant you're
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to have a grease trap
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
unless somebody proves otherwise
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
and then they have the tables and the
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
sizing and all the stuff that goes in
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
there so that's why i think we need to
 
03:34:29.349 --> 03:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
to buy some time
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
for the various departments to work with
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
us to zip these rules together
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
it may well be
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
that that the end game says take this
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
stuff out of the plumbing code by
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and just say go follow the des
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
rules that's one option the other option
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
is to bring the particulars of the des
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
rules into conformance with the model
 
03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:54.389 align:start position:0%
rules into conformance with the model
code

03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
that all needs to be talked about right
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
now but let me um
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
explain what i'm thinking about doing
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i would like to do today is you know
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
have discussion and questions to
 
03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully make sure we understand what
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
the issues and you know are and what
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be discussed i i certainly
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
support um
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
you folks getting together and and
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
trying to sort this out and coming back
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
with a kind of a joint recommendation
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm not planning on doing a final
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation report today
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking is we'll come back
 
03:35:29.590 --> 03:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
sometime in september
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to continue this a little
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
more today just i don't want a situation
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
where i'd like to avoid anyway a
 
03:35:36.630 --> 03:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
um there are issues that
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know between everybody involved
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
that haven't been brought up so at least
 
03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have a handle on on what we need to
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
do uh before the next meeting
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you so but
 
03:35:57.190 --> 03:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
the one of the things that bothers me
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
none of the waste water coming out of
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
this esta this particular establishment
 
03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
was evaluated at all
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
an inspector came in and said you just
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
need a thousand gallon grease trap and
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
that was it
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
so there was no
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
there was no real um
 
03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
investigation or
 
03:36:20.960 --> 03:36:22.710 align:start position:0%
investigation or
uh

03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at what
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
the the factors are that were involved
 
03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:29.670 align:start position:0%
the the factors are that were involved
here

03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was just
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
a dictate given to a business to do
 
03:36:34.399 --> 03:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
a dictate given to a business to do
something

03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
because that's what was in your rule
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
there was no uh you know
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't check
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the septic grease uh you know the
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
filter at all they didn't look at they
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
didn't look at anything they just came
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
in and said well you don't have this so
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
you have to have it
 
03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
you have to have it
and

03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
and that's one thing that really
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
so penny would like to respond
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the question
 
03:37:07.510 --> 03:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative aaron i think the issue
 
03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
being is is number one
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have the staff to
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
run around every restaurant in the state
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
that has a grease trap to see what
 
03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
that has a grease trap to see what
they're

03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
to sample their discharges
 
03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
secondly we know from past experience
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i've been around
 
03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
a long time that if we're coming to
 
03:37:27.030 --> 03:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
inspect something and practices many
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
times and i'm not throwing spears at
 
03:37:31.110 --> 03:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
baldur's arrows
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
changed because we're going there to do
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
some water quality sampling
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is when you get in a
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
situation and you have the basic
 
03:37:39.200 --> 03:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
situation and you have the basic
premises

03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
premises
 
03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:41.790 align:start position:0%
premises
of

03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
appliances if you will that are going to
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a large potential to generate
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater which in fact is going to
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
come out of that structure
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
and go
 
03:37:56.550 --> 03:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
to the ground waters of the state
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
then i think the the conservative
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
approach is is this is what you have you
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
got prior ladies you got a 180 degree
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
dishwasher you've got this you've got
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the potential is there that could
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
sell that property tomorrow somebody
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
could come in and have a total different
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
protocol of how they run their
 
03:38:18.309 --> 03:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant the bottom line is is that
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're responsible
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
for ensuring that when wastewater is
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
generated from any building whether you
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
own it today and bob comes in tomorrow
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and buys it and has total different
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
strategies on how they want to run that
 
03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
strategies on how they want to run that
kitchen

03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
so in the long term the viability of
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
discharge is always going to exist in
 
03:38:41.830 --> 03:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
that system
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
so in fact we go and look at the
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
conservative approach
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
here's the potential that is generated
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
because of the appliances i just talked
 
03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
because of the appliances i just talked
about

03:38:51.750 --> 03:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that's how that happened when this
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
particular facility got a septic system
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
approval there was no indication there
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
grease traps fried food
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
this that and the other thing so that's
 
03:39:08.229 --> 03:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
where this came about i will grant you
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
and phil has talked to our inspectors
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
that when we get in a situation like
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
this that maybe we have a lot
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
more in-depth dialogue
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
about where we're going
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
and i would concur with what you said i
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
said it's
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to think that our staff
 
03:39:28.710 --> 03:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
would be a little more accommodating but
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like they might have
 
03:39:30.319 --> 03:39:31.110 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like they might have
been

03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
which i apologize for if that's the case
 
03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:35.110 align:start position:0%
which i apologize for if that's the case
but

03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
i just want you to know that we're not
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
looking to be
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic at its best
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is our
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
assignment not commitment
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whenever we discharge
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
wastewater to the state's public trust
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater that in fact we do diligence
 
03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:56.309 align:start position:0%
groundwater that in fact we do diligence
on

03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
ensuring that in the long term
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
what is going to be discharged out of
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
that facility whatever it may be
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
is not going to be a detriment to the
 
03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
overall environment of new hampshire and
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
the state's groundwater
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
i if i may i can appreciate
 
03:40:13.680 --> 03:40:15.429 align:start position:0%
i if i may i can appreciate
that

03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:15.439 --> 03:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
that
view

03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
view
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
but by the same token
 
03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:20.070 align:start position:0%
but by the same token
um

03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to buy this
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
establishment and do something different
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
with it wouldn't you
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
before you license them look at that
 
03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
system again
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
you'd have to give them some sort of
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
license or
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay to do whatever they're doing or
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
whatever they propose to do
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and i think keep
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
in mind that we don't license the
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
operation of running a restaurant what
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
we do do is we permit
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
the structures ability
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
to discharge wastewater
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
if hhs goes in they have food inspectors
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that go throughout the state who
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually issue a food service license
 
03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
and they've had a lot of turnover like
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
we have all had in government
 
03:41:12.550 --> 03:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
if they go out and
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
the new folks aren't asked the right
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
questions or know what to look for they
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
may very well get a food license
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
but let me be very clear we do not
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
license the operation of a restaurant
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
we permit
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
the structures ability whether it be a
 
03:41:32.950 --> 03:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant child care
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
residential commercial whatever
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
we permit the right
 
03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
for them to generate
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
to discharge the generated wastewater
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever that facility is going to
 
03:41:44.960 --> 03:41:46.150 align:start position:0%
for whatever that facility is going to
produce

03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
produce
 
03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:46.950 align:start position:0%
produce
and

03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
i will say for the record that
 
03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
we certainly are experts in grease traps
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
we know what happens if grease traps
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
aren't maintained
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen it
 
03:41:59.110 --> 03:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
we've experienced in the last two or
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
three years some real concerns about
 
03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:02.710 align:start position:0%
three years some real concerns about
greece

03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
greece
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of people that are going
 
03:42:07.189 --> 03:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
into malls shopping centers
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
leasing space unbeknownst to the people
 
03:42:12.150 --> 03:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
that own the on-site waste water system
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
put in a restaurant put in high-temp
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
dishwashers 12 months down the road
 
03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
we get a plan come in because the septic
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
systems fail and you know why
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's because that system was never
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
designed adequately
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
to handle a grease load that now is
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
coming out of that structure
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
so who pays for that
 
03:42:35.309 --> 03:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
the guy that least
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
unsuspectingly to the land so
 
03:42:38.479 --> 03:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
unsuspectingly to the land so
it's

03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:41.189 align:start position:0%
it's
our

03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience has been
 
03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:44.469 align:start position:0%
experience has been
that

03:42:44.469 --> 03:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:44.479 --> 03:42:45.429 align:start position:0%
that
greece

03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
greece
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
is a detriment
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's as much of a detriment to the
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
people that own the system is it is
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
potentially to the environment if in
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
fact it blows out
 
03:42:56.720 --> 03:42:58.150 align:start position:0%
fact it blows out
and

03:42:58.150 --> 03:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:58.160 --> 03:42:59.269 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
i mean that's my plea
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what more to tell you
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
i feel pretty comfortable that that our
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
rules do not conflict and we could get
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
the ag's opinion if you'd like on that
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the building codes
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
two separate entities to different
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
worlds that we deal with we have the
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
expertise to determine strength of
 
03:43:24.150 --> 03:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
wastewater what it's going to discharge
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
and how it's handled
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to install an interior
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
grease trap in the plumbing
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
then they have plumbers they have
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
building codes that they have to follow
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
oh sorry then if they did i'm sorry yeah
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
no go ahead if you have a follow-up but
 
03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
then if
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
so if this establishment put in an
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
interior grease trap
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah if they came to us and requested a
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
waiver and told us that they had a high
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
temp dishwasher they had triolators
 
03:44:03.910 --> 03:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
they had
 
03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:05.269 align:start position:0%
they had
other

03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
ways to create and generate grease
 
03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're probably right
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're probably right
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance they have
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
one fry later
 
03:44:17.040 --> 03:44:18.229 align:start position:0%
one fry later
okay

03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
and they have i don't i don't know what
 
03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
their dishwasher is at all but the the
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
amount of grease coming out of this
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
business is minimal if you really take a
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
i mean so to require them to put in this
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
massive grease trap
 
03:44:37.269 --> 03:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
exterior to their building
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be total overkill and
 
03:44:40.880 --> 03:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
seems to be total overkill and
i

03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:44:43.510 --> 03:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that for other
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
businesses who
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
who may may have an interior grease trap
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
and nobody cares or nobody does anything
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
so i i just it just seems common sense
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:44:59.199 --> 03:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
to me
to

03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go into the situation
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
of permitting these businesses to have
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
and nobody wants greece in the
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
environment nobody wants to have
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
a situation where even the the the
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
septic hauler won't accept their
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
materials because
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're in contaminated with so much
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
grease or whatever
 
03:45:21.670 --> 03:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
we all understand that we don't want the
 
03:45:25.030 --> 03:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
environment to be harmed because of
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
miss sizing of grease traps
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
but we want it to be done in a common
 
03:45:31.110 --> 03:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
sense way that if you have a business
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's minimally
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
contrib you know
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
producing grease in their system that
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't need to be mandated to
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
put in a system that's totally overkill
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
for the system that they have
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
again i i
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand where you're
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
going with this
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
but you got to keep in mind that they
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
are appear to be very good stewards of
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
they could that business could change
 
03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:00.229 align:start position:0%
they could that business could change
tomorrow

03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
and what happens
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
thought process
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
we've both been having goes away because
 
03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
now we have no idea what's going to be
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of that structure
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's just like somebody coming to us an
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
analogy if i might would come in to us
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
and we get a phone call which is very
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
common by a building inspector that hey
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
bob added a fourth bedroom to his house
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would be like i go and talk to bob
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
and bob says to me well yeah but i don't
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
have ever plan on having people sleep
 
03:46:32.399 --> 03:46:34.150 align:start position:0%
have ever plan on having people sleep
there

03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
well bob you know so what are we
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do we have to take the
 
03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:41.110 align:start position:0%
supposed to do we have to take the
rational

03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
rational
 
03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:42.229 align:start position:0%
rational
approach

03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
the conservative approach and say look
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
if you're going to add the potential
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
of wastewater another 150 gallons per
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
day coming out of that bedroom which is
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
what our flows require then in fact your
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
system should be designed for it
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
different kind of waste water same thing
 
03:47:04.070 --> 03:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's what's being discharged to the
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
septic system and the environment
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're coming from
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
believe me we don't care
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
we want people to thrive
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
but our job is to in fact make sure that
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
we protect the groundwater and the
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
surface waters of the state
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
our rules have i've been at the des for
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
49 years
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
i've been through many rule making
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
processes over the years to see what's
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
our rules are not
 
03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:37.510 align:start position:0%
our rules are not
overzealous

03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
overzealous
 
03:47:40.950 --> 03:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think our experience over my lifetime
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
at that agency has been that we have
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
these rules in place because unlike the
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
people that you're dealing with may not
 
03:47:49.760 --> 03:47:50.469 align:start position:0%
people that you're dealing with may not
be

03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
such environmental
 
03:47:52.720 --> 03:47:54.070 align:start position:0%
such environmental
stewards

03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
stewards
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so what happens with any laws or
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
statutes that are created
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're created to protect the overall
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
environment and that's
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know again i want
 
03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that i'm not making
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
any accusations about your folks at this
 
03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:11.670 align:start position:0%
any accusations about your folks at this
restaurant

03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
they may be very good stewards the point
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make is if they walk away
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
from that structure
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
next month
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
and sell it
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
then we want to have the conservative
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
approach so we're not worrying about
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else coming in
 
03:48:31.750 --> 03:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
and blowing grease out of that agency
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
into the environment
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
but if i may i mean then if if a
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
business is sold or a house is sold
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
the the people coming in though would
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
have the place inspected they would have
 
03:48:47.189 --> 03:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
to go get uh
 
03:48:47.199 --> 03:48:47.910 align:start position:0%
to go get uh
so

03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question maybe to clarify
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
this and that is and then i'll i'll get
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:48:52.239 --> 03:48:53.429 align:start position:0%
to you
um

03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
so if a business is sold i mean it was
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
permitted as
 
03:49:00.630 --> 03:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
whatever this was a small restaurant or
 
03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:01.349 align:start position:0%
whatever this was a small restaurant or
or

03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
food dispensing place
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it sold to somebody else does ds get
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
involved at all in that
 
03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:08.790 align:start position:0%
involved at all in that
no

03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
so there's no permitting that where ds
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
would look at it again
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
assume unless there's a complaint would
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
you ever look at that place ever again
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
well that's a very good question i
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we don't consider
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves environmental police which
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would be sort of following say
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
nothing about i got three compliance
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
people to cover the whole state for all
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
water programs but i mean the point
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
being is and one may say
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
well people do diligence when they get
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
property transferred well that is the
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
furthest thing
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
from anything
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know how many people buy buildings
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
buy boat houses buy docks
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
buy commercial properties that aren't
 
03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:54.790 align:start position:0%
buy commercial properties that aren't
diligent

03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
diligent
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden we get a phone call
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they say geez i should have known my
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
lawyer didn't look at it well the stock
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
reality of it is here is most transfer
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
of property
 
03:50:08.790 --> 03:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
a large percentage of those transfers
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
have not done diligence it's the nature
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the beast
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt you have a
 
03:50:14.319 --> 03:50:17.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt you have a
question

03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like we've got several
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
issues in play here it's not just this
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
one situation
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i i was out of the committee room
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
hearing uh one of my own bills when this
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue came to edna the first time
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if you've ever walked
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
into a movie halfway through
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
he spent the rest of the movie trying to
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
figure out what the hell was going on
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't obvious
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
and at the end you got it completely
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
wrong because you
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have the first half
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see that first shot or whatever
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
but i came in and and this this issue
 
03:51:03.040 --> 03:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
but i came in and and this this issue
has

03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
lived in my head
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
for uh the um
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
for the entire time since then because
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
it is a serious issue
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
to the degree that that the state is
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
acting with heavy hand or an agency is
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
acting with heavy hand visa v
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the state
 
03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's something i don't think that any
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
of us would want to happen
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's a police officer that
 
03:51:35.349 --> 03:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the situation came in too
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
late in the movie
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the situation and arrested
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
the wrong person
 
03:51:42.870 --> 03:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
thought that something else was
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
happening and so forth and so on and the
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
net effect is harm is done to a citizen
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
a business whatever
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of information
 
03:51:54.319 --> 03:51:55.189 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of information
so

03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm striving for a perfect world here
 
03:51:57.600 --> 03:51:58.389 align:start position:0%
i'm striving for a perfect world here
renny

03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
renny
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
but i've been thinking about this for a
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
long time because as you know and
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the rest of you a couple of my
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee members know i'm on the jail
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
car and i have been for 16 years so i
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
see the state agencies coming before me
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
constantly with regard to rules and so
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
forth that are supposed to implement
 
03:52:23.349 --> 03:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
statues so this is the kind of issue
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
that you've raised representative that's
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
very troubling because at first glance
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
in any way it certainly seems
 
03:52:30.880 --> 03:52:32.389 align:start position:0%
in any way it certainly seems
that

03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing was done
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm not an expert i'm not a plumber
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i missed the first half of the movie
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i've got all the facts
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
even now
 
03:52:42.239 --> 03:52:43.349 align:start position:0%
even now
so

03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
to try to resolve this particular issue
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit of study
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
to see if we can get a better process so
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
that state agencies interact better with
 
03:52:55.199 --> 03:52:56.389 align:start position:0%
that state agencies interact better with
customers

03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
customers
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
and and we've seen bills like this
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
know a number of times over my 20 years
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:04.070 align:start position:0%
in the house
where

03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:53:06.870 --> 03:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get the state agencies
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
to work better with our business
 
03:53:08.800 --> 03:53:09.990 align:start position:0%
to work better with our business
community

03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that you get
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
incoming businesses have a more
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
welcoming and accepting and
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding reception
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that we don't get the situation
 
03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:22.630 align:start position:0%
and that we don't get the situation
where

03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
the state gets it wrong
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
and comes down because as they say first
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
blush this large and i saw the pictures
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
and heard the story of the the the the
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
devices that this
 
03:53:42.080 --> 03:53:43.510 align:start position:0%
devices that this
former

03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
former
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
ice cream store wasn't that what it was
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
originally an ice cream shop and it
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
started suddenly
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
and now they've got a different
 
03:53:54.560 --> 03:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
and now they've got a different
situation

03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it just didn't seem reasonable to me
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm very concerned about this because
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
i i am also i am always trying
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
to achieve perfection so this is issue
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
one and i think it's worth pursuing
 
03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:10.870 align:start position:0%
one and i think it's worth pursuing
uh

03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
the other one of the other issues
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
certainly is the one that
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
mr sherman
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
trowbridge and so forth are talking
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
about and you're
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
not disagreeing with that
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
have an interaction of the two agencies
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
involved the bill mcconnell review board
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
i've seen you guys in action over the
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
years uh and yes
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to this
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
the the issue of greece
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
in general
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
because i have i i'm a city guy
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
i live in dover my girlfriend lives in
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth so everything we produce goes
 
03:54:52.150 --> 03:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
into the city sewer system
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
a very different world from when you're
 
03:54:56.469 --> 03:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
out in the country
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
producing something that's going to go
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
into your into the groundwater or into a
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
septic system
um

03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
and if and if you overload it you got a
 
03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
and if and if you overload it you got a
problem

03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm very disposed to see you guys
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
have the time to see if our processes in
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire work as well
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
as they might
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects that's clearly
 
03:55:20.710 --> 03:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
involved here
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
is that we are still a relatively small
 
03:55:23.279 --> 03:55:24.630 align:start position:0%
is that we are still a relatively small
state

03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
we have limited resources as even new
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
york and california do they still have a
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
limit it's a lot higher than ours
 
03:55:33.910 --> 03:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
but the question is the resources so
 
03:55:35.429 --> 03:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
have as many people
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do the work
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
and that they are as well
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
trained and
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
overseen and
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
provided with statutory and rule
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
production and so forth so that it works
 
03:55:57.030 --> 03:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
as well as possible so i my question
 
03:55:58.389 --> 03:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there's always a
 
03:55:58.399 --> 03:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there's always a
question

03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:00.790 align:start position:0%
question
is

03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:01.910 align:start position:0%
is
this

03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
thing that you're
 
03:56:05.189 --> 03:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
talking about having the time
 
03:56:07.830 --> 03:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps to study some other states
 
03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:09.429 align:start position:0%
perhaps to study some other states
processes

03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
processes
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
to see whether there's something we
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
could learn from them so we don't have
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
to invent a wheel by ourselves
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
that seems like a reasonable enterprise
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
in itself
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
but i would also like to see what
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
we can do about this particular instance
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
that you've raised
 
03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:28.630 align:start position:0%
that you've raised
which

03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
as i say where we it seems like
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state came at it heavy-handedly
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know there was a bill
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
that that that we in
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
you didn't have it in you on your
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee but all of us on edna the rest
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
of us
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
had with regard to the jail car there
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
was a bill
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
that was going to basically completely
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
rework the gel car
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
rule approval
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that is a major undertaking as you
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
can imagine those of you who dealt with
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
a gel car
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
that it may be appropriate to have
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
some bill go forward
 
03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
but but
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that we got the right
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
language at this point at this time and
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know maybe you don't
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
that this this bill
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
nothing's happening with it now it's
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
dead for this session right the only
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
question is is it coming back next year
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
and in what form
 
03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that there are several
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
aspects here that and i
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
i've worked together with with uh
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative leckus a great deal
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the time he's been in on edna and i
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
know that he's got it not only a
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
high level functioning intelligence but
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of dedication no no honey around
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
your mouth but uh uh but a lot of
 
03:57:54.070 --> 03:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
dedication to try to get at
 
03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
right problems that the state has to try
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
to resolve them in the best interests of
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
the people and of the state as well so
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward hang on a moment if you
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
would turn your mic off a moment i
 
03:58:03.600 --> 03:58:04.630 align:start position:0%
would turn your mic off a moment i
actually

03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
kind of related to this i have a
 
03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
question from mr uh trumbridge if i'm
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
pronouncing that correctly you said that
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
the department um you know has
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
used his discretion in the application
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
of the rules
 
03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:20.070 align:start position:0%
of the rules
so

03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
the question i mean my question is um
 
03:58:25.590 --> 03:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know given what we were told about
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
um you know ds goes in and approves
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know sort of some standard function
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the building paying in effect no
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
attention to what the current owner is
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
going to do because they're
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
there they don't know who's going to own
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the future what they're going to do
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean what circumstances would you use
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
discretion and is there
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance presuming
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
for the sake of argument that
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
the thousand gallon tank is really
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and grossly too big for
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
what they are doing
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that i don't know for sure
 
03:58:55.760 --> 03:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
assuming that i don't know for sure
myself

03:58:56.950 --> 03:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
um you know how would this process of
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
discretion been applied what would the
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
business owner have done how would this
 
03:59:06.070 --> 03:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
all have work because from what we've
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
been told they were just given this dot
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
and no indication that there was any way
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
to do anything else
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt said what to do
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
about this case well at this point
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
they've already put the thing in
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a matter of okay
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:59:22.720 --> 03:59:23.830 align:start position:0%
you know
assuming

03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
03:59:23.840 --> 03:59:25.349 align:start position:0%
assuming
that

03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:26.950 --> 03:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know the things weren't applied
 
03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
correctly at least for this owner of
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
this business how could it have been
 
03:59:30.800 --> 03:59:31.670 align:start position:0%
this business how could it have been
done

03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
differently and better for this
 
03:59:33.439 --> 03:59:37.189 align:start position:0%
differently and better for this
application

03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know we use discretion
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
with great discretion i guess is a way
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
to say it
 
03:59:47.520 --> 03:59:48.870 align:start position:0%
to say it
and

03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
we um you know we have the ability to
 
03:59:53.910 --> 03:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
wave rule but not statute so we clearly
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
do not do any kind of you know anything
 
03:59:58.150 --> 03:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's in statute we don't
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know we have no authority to change
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh so that's the first question we
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
always ask ourselves is this in rule or
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
resistance statute and then
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh for rules we do have
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
requirements in the in our like in the
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
rules as you would know representative
 
04:00:15.189 --> 04:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
schmidt from from jl carr
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have the rule that allows us to wave
 
04:00:19.110 --> 04:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
rules under certain conditions you know
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
and those conditions might be that
 
04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
no harm to the environment no effect on
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
a neighboring property
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera it kind of depends
 
04:00:29.910 --> 04:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
on which program you're you're in what
 
04:00:31.670 --> 04:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
those specifics are
 
04:00:31.680 --> 04:00:32.469 align:start position:0%
those specifics are
um

04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so we're very careful on this you
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
know for the reasons that um uh mr
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
pelletier talked about because you know
 
04:00:41.110 --> 04:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
the extreme cost of a of a failed septic
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
system or the extreme cost of septage
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know holler not being able to
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
dispose of their load so we really only
 
04:00:47.760 --> 04:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
dispose of their load so we really only
are

04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
waive this rule in cases where you know
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
um assurances that this building doesn't
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
have seating i mean a small a small
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
shack doesn't have seating um but it
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the grease generating
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
appliances you know installed or the
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
capacity for those
 
04:01:08.309 --> 04:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
um and so in this case you know when it
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
was just um ice cream it was something
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we felt comfortable with but
 
04:01:13.040 --> 04:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
that we felt comfortable with but
um

04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
the switch to the fried food and you
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
know regardless of how much it was and i
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know your
 
04:01:20.880 --> 04:01:22.309 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know your
your

04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
constituents you know are not you know
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're running it in a way that doesn't
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
generate much but they are running it in
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
a way that has the capacity to generate
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
grease someone else could buy that
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
business and run it in a different way
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's you know tripped the
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
threshold for us
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
we we do try to work with people i mean
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we're public servants
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to help people achieve
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
their objectives so we
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
you know we try and you know we deal
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
with a high volume of applications so
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know we are quick in the
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
response and we could take a little more
 
04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
time and i'm working with staff on that
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know i think that's how it
 
04:02:00.870 --> 04:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
might be handled differently is just
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
better explanation
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing and the reasons why
 
04:02:05.040 --> 04:02:05.830 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing and the reasons why
um

04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
but you know realistically because you
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
know the generation of
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
fried foods in this facility right now
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
we really
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
we would not have have waived that
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that rule
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.479 --> 04:02:27.269 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
i wonder if i might suggest a path
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
forward addressing these concerns uh if
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
as you indicated
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
you scheduled a meeting in september i
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
would hope later in september only
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
because not much is going to happen in
 
04:02:40.160 --> 04:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
because not much is going to happen in
august

04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
august
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
and let des bcrb get the proper people
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
from both groups
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
the technical experts
 
04:02:49.520 --> 04:02:50.469 align:start position:0%
the technical experts
to

04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
look at the two sets of rules see where
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
the overlap is give great sensitivity to
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
these smaller uh institutions
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's heard the concern here
 
04:02:59.840 --> 04:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
everybody's heard the concern here
clearly

04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:03:03.990 --> 04:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
and come back to you all in september
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
with at least a conceptual agreement
 
04:03:06.640 --> 04:03:07.590 align:start position:0%
with at least a conceptual agreement
that

04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh if there are rule changes or
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code or both
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
that are necessary that we'll proceed to
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
get those into the mix
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to update anything before
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
then anyway
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that will let us get the get
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
the technical issues in a in a clear
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
manner in front of us and come back to
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
you with some some agreement as to where
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
we think things ought ahead and then see
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
whether uh that satisfies the need uh i
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
think we probably do have the right
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislation in place uh there may need
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be rule changes on both sides uh
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
and and that just needs some study
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion yeah thank you um that
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
sounds good i'll hang in just a moment
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
and um yeah it's it would have to be
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
later september i'll be traveling the
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
earlier part of the state anyway
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing to look at as
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
part of that is um
 
04:04:01.520 --> 04:04:02.550 align:start position:0%
part of that is um
whether

04:04:02.550 --> 04:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know it might be appropriate to add
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit of clarification on 155 a2
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
roman 10 that we had discussed to see if
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
because there's actually two parts to it
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
and one of them
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
is sort of a little clearer on what it
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
means i think than the first part but
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
um we could we can go into that more in
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you can respond
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
i i agree fully uh
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
that carries over to a much broader
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
issue with other other agencies and so
 
04:04:34.080 --> 04:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
issue with other other agencies and so
forth

04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
whereas this task
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
through the summer might almost be an
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
exemplar as to how we could deal with
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
some of these issues and if we're
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
successful prove that it can actually be
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
done and we all come out singing off the
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
same sheet of music
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so you actually in uh
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
you sent an email that noted that there
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
were a number of other departments that
 
04:04:55.600 --> 04:04:56.550 align:start position:0%
were a number of other departments that
had

04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
put in place rules that might impinge on
 
04:04:59.120 --> 04:05:00.389 align:start position:0%
put in place rules that might impinge on
the

04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
purview of the state building code
 
04:05:04.630 --> 04:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
review board and i think you mentioned
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
in a general sense some of them if you
 
04:05:06.239 --> 04:05:07.349 align:start position:0%
in a general sense some of them if you
could

04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
get any more specifics to me that would
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
be um
 
04:05:12.880 --> 04:05:14.229 align:start position:0%
be um
helpful

04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh because at least that statute
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
change would be and have an impact on
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
all of those um representative bailey
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
04:05:25.590 --> 04:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes um i i like your idea mr sherman of
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
getting together and coming up with
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
something because this should never have
 
04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
happened and it should never happen
 
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:33.269 align:start position:0%
happened and it should never happen
again

04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
and as far as i'm concerned i would vote
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
scaling right up to eliminating your
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
department to make sure this never
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
happens again so you need to come up
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
with something to make sure that this
 
04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
would never happen
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has uh
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i have
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
a couple of i i think we need to hear
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
from health and human services also
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
because i think they're approving
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the restaurants in the and so i i
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
think they're part of the puzzle here
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
but i also just have two technical
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions i just want to know what does
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
isds stand for
 
04:06:15.760 --> 04:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
isds stand for
and

04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to gravity grease
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
inceptors so if somebody can tell me
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
what is a gravity one and what are the
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
kinds that are something other than
 
04:06:27.359 --> 04:06:29.670 align:start position:0%
kinds that are something other than
gravity

04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
gravity
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah please respond if you can
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the first
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
question is ists individual sewage
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
disposal system so it's it's the
 
04:06:42.150 --> 04:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
technical term for a septic system
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and then the gravity
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
with onsite wastewater we always
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
distinguish between gravity-fed systems
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
and ones that need pumps so a gravity
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
fed there's no
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical pumps involved it you know
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
the water flows downhill through the
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
system just by gravity um and then but
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
you have circumstances where someone
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
needs to actually pump
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
something to another location and that's
 
04:07:09.429 --> 04:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
what are the other kinds other than
 
04:07:11.199 --> 04:07:12.469 align:start position:0%
what are the other kinds other than
gravity

04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
gravity
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
or well it has a well
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
aren't there i thought that the grease
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
what i saw on the internet had to do
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
with things like some of them sit
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
underneath like the sink
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen and then but you
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
the ones that you're talking about are
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
outside the building is that seems that
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
that seems like two very different
 
04:07:37.110 --> 04:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
things to me uh this sorry i may have
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the question so a sign of
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
gravity there's you know gravity systems
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
for septic systems almost all say all
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
grease traps operate on the basis of
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
gravity which is just
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
density separation of fluids so that you
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
a container big enough
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the flows can can
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a residence time of of days so that
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
the oils and grease can float to the
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
surface and separate from the water and
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
then the outlet of that of that
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
structure is below the layer where the
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
grease is
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
so that the you know the water is going
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
anything else or so
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
when you have that they all have that
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
whether you put them outside or inside
 
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
they all work in that same principle
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
yeah they all so what happens when
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's too much
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
grease that's why the um then the the
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
grease will would exit
 
04:08:37.349 --> 04:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
this grease trap it would not be an
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
effective trap and then it would go into
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
the septic system
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that's where we get the failure
 
04:08:42.880 --> 04:08:44.309 align:start position:0%
and that's where we get the failure
problems

04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
and so when i was mentioning earlier
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
about you know the pump out rates
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh and the frequency of that that it all
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
has to be connected so that you are
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
pumping it out frequently enough so you
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't get too much grease
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't it get like clogged up and the
 
04:09:01.110 --> 04:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
water doesn't even go down uh
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
no if it liquid grease this is normally
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
not not like a solid fat but like a
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
liquid grease would just be washed out
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
with the water and that
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
that then clogs up the
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
the soil pores in the septic system does
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
it does an alarm go off or something how
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
no it does not and that you know that's
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know i guess part of the the
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
rationale of these larger requiring
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
these larger tanks is because they're
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
more foolproof
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
but they can get clogged they do the
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
same thing right yes but they are they
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
they're they don't need to be pumped out
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
as frequently
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
and they okay
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah so if you need
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
a trash can size scent thing
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
but if you buy put in a
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
thing the size of a swimming pool
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to last a lot longer before
 
04:09:51.520 --> 04:09:52.309 align:start position:0%
it's going to last a lot longer before
it

04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
fails correct
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
right and i uh having uh dealt with my
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
own septic system for almost 40 years um
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
i you're talking about backing up i mean
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
if you get enough grease out of the
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
leech field and the leech field clogs up
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
enough then things would either either
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
back up or the stuff would be bubbling
 
04:10:10.399 --> 04:10:11.269 align:start position:0%
back up or the stuff would be bubbling
up

04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
your leech field which isn't good um
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
but yeah the restaurant has to have the
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
grease trap emptied periodically even if
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's working correctly
 
04:10:24.790 --> 04:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
let's let's not lose fact
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
let's track of the fact that what we
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony at the time was that
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
zero grease
 
04:10:35.110 --> 04:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
went into the septic system
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the guy
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
pulled it out and sold it down the
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
street and zero was going in there so
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
all this talk about all the different
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
levels of water and grease the
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
separation it's all just nonsense in
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
this case
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
he should have had a variance
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we can talk all we want about septic
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
systems and isds and all this but it
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
does not apply
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
that there was zero grease in this case
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh aaron thank you mr
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
chair yes so i have a question to for
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
you what
 
04:11:08.319 --> 04:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
you what
is

04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
what are the problems that you can
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
encounter with an oversized
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
grease trap system i i'm understanding
 
04:11:17.199 --> 04:11:18.149 align:start position:0%
grease trap system i i'm understanding
that

04:11:18.149 --> 04:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
putting in or installing an improper
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
aside from being a waste of money
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
could cause an unsanitary situation
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
where you have odors you have bacteria
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
growing you have um you know sort of
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
that also can create an unsafe situation
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
is that not the case
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would be the case for an in the
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
building grease trap not for a septic
 
04:11:44.640 --> 04:11:48.469 align:start position:0%
building grease trap not for a septic
tank

04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
the public here who'd like to speak on
 
04:11:56.239 --> 04:11:58.469 align:start position:0%
the public here who'd like to speak on
this

04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for offering to get
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
together and try and come up with uh
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully some way of uh
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with there's actually a few
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
issues one is
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of a a conflict
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
between um
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
155 a 2
 
04:12:17.680 --> 04:12:18.790 align:start position:0%
155 a 2
10

04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
and what ds is doing as far as an
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
overlap of
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the ds rules and whether or
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
not they were
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
passed by and approved by the building
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
code review board and you folks can talk
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
about that and come back with
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know your your take on it and any
 
04:12:34.479 --> 04:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
you know your your take on it and any
recommendation

04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
the other one i'd look for is um
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know is there any way to have dealt
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
better with a situation like this again
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
presuming that
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
they really didn't need anything even
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
close to this this thousand gallon
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
grease trap it would have been a better
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
way to handle this
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
you could also discuss the 155 a2 the
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
where there's
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
departments creating rules that might
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
impinge on what's in the building code
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
is there something that we can do about
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
that either require statute or at least
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
maybe when the rules get get renewed i
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
mean if that's true then presumably if
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
they went through normal rule making
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
those rules would have gone to jail car
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
and if there is such a
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
a situation where they're creating rules
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
that should have been reviewed by the
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
building code review board but we're not
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
that somehow that wasn't caught and
 
04:13:30.399 --> 04:13:31.429 align:start position:0%
that somehow that wasn't caught and
maybe

04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know the staff on gel core or the
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
members on it could be
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
keeping a little closer eye out for that
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
particular issue for the future when
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
rules get renewed
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows i i'd be
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
interested to to know what um the
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulations related to greece are for
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay that's interesting i don't
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
presume they keep in the truck and
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
discharge it somewhere yeah they they're
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
they're kind of trucks that drive up and
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
they're selling for
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're historically not connected to a
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
wastewater discharge
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
what they do with it when they leave the
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
site god only knows
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
but they don't pull up in park and go
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
into a septic system generally they're
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
usually self-contained kind of like an
 
04:14:19.199 --> 04:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
usually self-contained kind of like an
rv

04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't regulate food trucks
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't put it directly in
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
what i might suggest uh mr chair is that
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know what we're talking about here
 
04:14:39.840 --> 04:14:43.269 align:start position:0%
you know what we're talking about here
is

04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
and that this is actually being recorded
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
and people out youtube land or whatever
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
can view this now and in the future if
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
they like i think uh what i'm gonna do
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
from to
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
try and respond to the questions about
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps conflicts
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
is i think because i'm an attorney by uh
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
engineer by trade not an attorney
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
but i think what
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
what maybe phil and i can do is ask the
 
04:15:10.560 --> 04:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
what maybe phil and i can do is ask the
ag

04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
ag
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
here's 155 he has 485 here's the rules
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
is there a conflict because i think it
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
truly is a legal question
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
not so much you know if you were to put
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
me in a room and
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask me legally if our rules conflicted
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
with 155 i'm not sure i'd feel
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable in answering that should i
 
04:15:32.080 --> 04:15:32.950 align:start position:0%
comfortable in answering that should i
think

04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh the ag certainly could so having that
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
legal opinion is good i'd also like to
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
suggest that um
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
even if technically
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
some of these rules didn't have to be
 
04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the building code review
 
04:15:45.439 --> 04:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the building code review
board

04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:15:49.110 --> 04:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
at least passing it by them
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
for review even if it's not
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
officially required and you can put them
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
in place without that
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea because it might
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
bring up potential
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts even if they're not legally
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
technically conflicts and avoid some
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
problems in the future
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd like to ask is
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
for you folks i'm going to put a piece
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
of paper up there if you can write your
 
04:16:10.880 --> 04:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
of paper up there if you can write your
name

04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
name
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%

and um you know so i can let you know
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
