00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
friends on house bill 533
 
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:56.549 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
so we should reference 287d three
 
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
now representative ames you have another
 
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the new language
 
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
added by the senate conservative
 
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.469 align:start position:0%
added by the senate conservative
background

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
men's 287-d colon 11.
 
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
3 and essentially changes three
 
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
so that the lottery commission is the
 
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
upfront agency to do
 
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
the investigations that still
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
role for the attorney general in the
 
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
right in 287-d
 
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
11 after roman
 
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
the expenses incurred by the attorney
 
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
the expenses incurred by the attorney
general

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
doing those background investigations
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
which it had been doing
 
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
may be charged back as but shall be a
 
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
that authorizes the attorney general's
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
costs to be charged back
 
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
switching to the lottery commission
 
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
incurring those costs
 
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
the statute needs to pick up the change
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
in four and there's a similar problem
 
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
in five uh this is a roman 5
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
the 287-d
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
which allows the attorney general to
 
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
which allows the attorney general to
acquire

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
the by subpoena or otherwise the
 
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
as needed for the investigations and
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
again as the attorney general versus the
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
letter we're switching over to the
 
00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
lottery commission but we're not giving
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
the lottery commissioned the tools and i
 
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.670 align:start position:0%
the lottery commissioned the tools and i
think

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
at least that's what it looked like to
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
me i haven't looked closely at this but
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
i'm just flagging this
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
obviously an easy fix
 
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
we all would have agreed to go forward
 
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
switch of the background investigation
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think it looks to me like it would
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe there's some other provision
 
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the statute somewhere
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
that would enable the lottery commission
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
to charge back
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and to do the uh stuff he was calling in
 
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
our witnesses
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't know of that representative
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as the charging the expenses
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the investigation the lottery
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
commission has full authority to set its
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
own fees
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i would expect they would simply
 
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
adjust their application fee to cover
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
the expected cost of the investigation
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's a normal process for licensing
 
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's a normal process for licensing
agents

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
the i don't know about the subpoenas
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
it may be covered under if you look at
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
peyton one of the side by side roman two
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
it says the division shall have such
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
civil and
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
administrative powers as necessary to
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
affect the purpose of this chapter
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
including the power to receive
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence upon applicants
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
to investigate any suspected violations
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not a lawyer but that sure seems
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
to be that that would
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether the costs of an investigation
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
would correspond
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
with the existing fee structure and
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
could be dealt with that way i don't
 
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
could be dealt with that way i don't
know

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
i i would think it would be better if it
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
could be managed within this conference
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee to do a straight fix
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and add the lottery commission in
 
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.749 align:start position:0%
and uh and add the lottery commission in
both

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
sub-sections unless somebody has some
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
reason not to do that
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's an easy thing to fix it just it
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
more awkward to get to the closure of
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly but you've given the
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
iteration of clearly indicates they have
 
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.029 align:start position:0%
iteration of clearly indicates they have
supreme

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
supreme
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
problems but if you if you think that it
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
would be better to explicitly cause it i
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
if we weren't making other changes i
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
might say
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
well it's already there but since we are
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
making changes to correct the reference
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
we might as well
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually get the language clearly that
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's not going to be that much
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
because you understand what you want to
 
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.029 align:start position:0%
because you understand what you want to
change

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
the way you do is run down to ols they
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
were all
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
down there yeah they have them all down
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
there yeah and
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know other than taking the final
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
vote unless
 
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 align:start position:0%

you don't have this language i
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
understand i'm looking at the statute
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
which i printed out last night
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so five says in any investigation
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
conducted pursuant to paragraph three
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and then i would
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
introduce the same language

he's not even paying attention
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%

what i have done is after talking with
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
in center guide is that i've at least
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment of the os
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
in both your names um to
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
change references in the bill
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
from rsa 287 to rsa287d
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
or less can't exactly turn around in

another five minutes
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping to get that amended soon
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
if there's another amendment
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
we need to have it physically in our

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.839 --> 00:29:39.269 align:start position:0%
 
she's

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the list uh we had friends set but
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
fred is being replaced by
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative genevieve um
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
fred has a mental issue that's fine it's
 
00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.830 align:start position:0%
fred has a mental issue that's fine it's
like

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
late afternoon they still haven't
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're trying to schedule a
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know as long to get involved
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
so um so fred
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
is not with us but so um
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
obviously this book this bill was about
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
sportsbook and
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
we all remember we we passed sports
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
betting back in 2019
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that session uh
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
and the bill uh
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
there were two things that uh well that
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be discussing that relate to
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
was the uh the tier two issue and i
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
think we all agree on the tier two issue
 
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
that tier 2 can only currently be played
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.710 align:start position:0%
that tier 2 can only currently be played
[Music]

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
vets can only be placed on maps
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
but not in the physical locations this
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill changes that to
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
be able to do the tier two bet and the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
physical locations
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that's that we both agree on
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
both sides uh when we passed the bill
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
we passed it with a limitation of ten
 
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
we passed it with a limitation of ten
locations

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment this representative
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
langsmann and
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill bill took that
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
and made it unlimited but in the house
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
ways it means
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh and we're unanimous on this
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan we renounce that
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know two years isn't quite enough to
 
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.870 align:start position:0%
you know two years isn't quite enough to
see

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
how this is going to take off and how
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know how many locations what kind of
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
demand there really is for these
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
physical locations so we we kept we put
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
the 10
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
back in in our amendment and then it
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
went over to the
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
took the 10 out and made it unlimited
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that's where that's the issue we're
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
going to be discussing
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
one of my arguments in the house ways
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
and needs was
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
that you know and i've i've talked to
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
the guys in manchester and i've talked
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the guys at
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
zebra and you come to find that there's
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
a bit of a risk
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
being a physical location and that
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's a risk because
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the way betting happens so
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
part of my thinking is that that you
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
know if we're trying to attract
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're gonna they're gonna be taking a
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
risk to do this and
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
they want they want to know that someday
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
this could be in 50 locations around the
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
state and
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
cutting them to fire you know i i'm all
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
for free enterprise i'm all for
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
about mother market talk and i talked to
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
charlie the other day he has no
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
no position on this of course but i said
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
well where are we
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
i i wanted the update so obviously we
 
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.950 align:start position:0%
i i wanted the update so obviously we
have

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
see brooke in manchester um
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
who's in play we got three in play we've
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
got salem
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
berlin or interested
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then the communities because this is
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
the opt-in thing
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
about it i saw those and then we have
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
nashua but nashua has he hasn't voted
 
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.110 align:start position:0%
nashua but nashua has he hasn't voted
yet

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that community hasn't voted yet so in
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
we've attracted five two that are
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
three that are interested so it's fine
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
so our position is
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know if there's ultimately the
 
00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:31.990 align:start position:0%
you know if there's ultimately the
demand

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know we you know what's the rush for
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
us to open it up
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
um you know if we think this demand we
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
can follow bill
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
down the road to say okay well let's
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
expand this to 15 or 20
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
whatever or make it unlimited um
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
so that's and again it was a 24 nothing
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
vote out of our ways and means and it
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
was on consensus
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
so simply stated that's it uh but again
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
and i purposely talked to to uh charlie
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
a couple days ago just to get the latest
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
update on where we are
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that was the latest update basically
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
the same update he gave me a couple of
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
basically the known movement on on
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
berlin or
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
or uh salem
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
was uh did you know if they were waiting
 
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
was uh did you know if they were waiting
on

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation i don't know i didn't
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
ask them that i should
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
they don't know you mean other parts of
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be waiting on this because
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
they're not acting on it you know
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
they're not acting that's what they said
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
are they not acting waiting to see if
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a proliferation of
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
similar yeah right again that's my
 
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.069 align:start position:0%
similar yeah right again that's my
theory

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
theory
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's a risk of i was gonna invest in
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
this i noticed that there was a risk
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
i understand that how many books we can
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.069 align:start position:0%
i understand that how many books we can
have

00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
physical locations you know
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's just me and i and i think our our
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee agreed that you know let's
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
let's just wait and see and see what the
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
market does
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
before we jump into opening this up and
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
i always say this about bills it's only
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
been two years
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
we we passed this bill with the premise
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
that there'll be ten locations
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay at least initially you know what i
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
mean and now here we are two layers
 
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
mean and now here we are two layers
later

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna change that you
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
know let's let's let the body be
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know cold first you know before we
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
we start changing is there a correlation
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
between opening up to tier two
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the number of locations that's a
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
good question too
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
i think that may be a helpful thing
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i i heard from the manchester
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
ramsey wrote that
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're cons they're they're very upset
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
that they have bodies in their seats
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah and then and the game is
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
and there's some people that like to be
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
physically making bets with other people
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
around you know it's there
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
but they're concerned that's what we're
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
all agreeing on tier 2 i think is that
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
then they fill out their phones to pay
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know what next next quarter
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to score the most points has
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
to be done on the on the app
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
not on physically there
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
and the facilities don't get any share
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
revenue because it's being done on the
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
app it's not done
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
by them so all those bets they don't get
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
money for
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know any you know small amount
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
whatever they get so
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so again our position is
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's the rush and uh
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know i'll leave it up to you you
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
well what's the rush what's the what's
 
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
well what's the rush what's the what's
the

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
seabrook's in full operation yes very
 
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
seabrook's in full operation yes very
much

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
so they were good now
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
just it was the first place right going
 
00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.510 align:start position:0%
just it was the first place right going
on

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
the governor go there initially yeah
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
they were first but they were very close
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
they opened both about the same time
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
so of the ten that have been appropriate
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
how many how many are actually playing
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
as we speak
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's the point then i asked charlie
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
the other day i said
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
how many other applications have been
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
filed right
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
or interest not even applications who
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
else has expressed interest
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
salem berlin location right and
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
and uh in nashville now charlie would
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
he would love to see locations in the
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
bigger locations in the bigger
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
markets there was also
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
a situation in nashville where another
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
casino is being developed
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
right right now that's that's boston
 
00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.069 align:start position:0%
right right now that's that's boston
billiards

00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
billiards
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth the wait for the
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of just looking to expand
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that they would love this up
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
this this entity as part of their
 
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.390 align:start position:0%
this this entity as part of their
package

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
package
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
if the if the situation the sale of them
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
gets right it ever gets resolved
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
they're not beating down the doors it's
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
been two years you know i'm getting down
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
the doors
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're right that maybe they are waiting
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to change to say
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know that they can do the tier two
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
betting um
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh again we all agree that yeah that
 
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
uh again we all agree that yeah that
that's

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna do it we should have the
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
act version
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
the same as the location
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
there is no downside
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
we only have two operating and two
 
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
we only have two operating and two
looking

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
three both three possibly
 
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
three both three possibly
so

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
unless there's some harm that comes from
 
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.310 align:start position:0%
unless there's some harm that comes from
yeah

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
french

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
daniel's daniel's comments were
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
that he thinks it's unconstitutional
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
always done in the house because it was
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
either the anti-gambling people
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
or the or the constitutional you know or
 
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
or the or the constitutional you know or
the

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
free market people and so
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
add them all up that didn't want casinos
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
we'd never pass
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
i mean for different reasons for a lot
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
of reasons
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and there was no way that we were going
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to open it you know
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
because it's terrible gaming you can see
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting that way but well that's a
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
whole lot
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
let's hold that but but there was always
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
guys that said well why only one person
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
why only two casinos you know we had a
 
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:30.790 align:start position:0%
why only two casinos you know we had a
bill

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
let's have slot machines in every every
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
store that wants a slot machine
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think but again i go back to my theory
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's a theory i don't i can't prove this
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
logic i said but if i'm a businessman
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
i tonight so i'm going to invest in
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
sports but then we're going to take this
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
sports book we're going to split it up
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know such a number of people that
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
want a bet
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's just going to shrink there's only
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
so many betters in new hampshire
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
i mean also the border i mean one thing
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
we know is that seabrook is picked up
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
you go i was there i dragged my wife
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
there for kentucky derby
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
she goes we want to go i said listen go
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
over replace the bed
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
you look at the parking lot most you
 
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:27.910 align:start position:0%
you look at the parking lot most you
know

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
over half the plates in massachusetts
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
they come up close
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
so um but anyway i i just
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe free markets too and i i
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
i could i can envision senator daniel
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
saying what he said
 
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
right uh does the heart either work
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:42:07.670 align:start position:0%
right uh does the heart either work
[Music]

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
because the markets already seems to be
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
talking that
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know they're not they're not banging
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
on the doors to invest in these
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand if we say it's
 
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand if we say it's
unlimited

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
that why would i want to
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
invest in something like this and
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's risk
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
when we can take the the population and
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
split it
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh of potential betters and spread it
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
over 20 locations
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know how far would a potential
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
better bill
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
but you know i wonder if that number 10
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
came out of 10 cities
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
back when we did this this build that
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
led to this
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
wall sports betting
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
in ways it means it was a new and
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
complicated subject so we set up
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
a subject
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
which i shared right right i think uh
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative and you were part of that
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we had a good working group
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
through all the issues and this one came
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
up what about the number of
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
they think there was consensus as i
 
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
they think there was consensus as i
recall

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
this was a new activity
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just jump in without
 
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just jump in without
limitations

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
this was true in other parts of the
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
building and
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think it was charlie who suggested
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
maybe wrong
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know but it's it's obviously
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
but uh but 10 was from
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
his perspective and it still is as i
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
well above the likely number
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
that would come in at least in the early
 
00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:14.950 align:start position:0%
that would come in at least in the early
years

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
suggested 10 we put it in we went to a
 
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.230 align:start position:0%
suggested 10 we put it in we went to a
24-0

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
24-0
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
vote i don't know whether that
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
limitation brought some people in who
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
would have voted against it or not i
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
actually don't know
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
but we had we had we had total consensus
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
with all its parts put it forward
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm with chad with the brush
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
your expression um i think we know that
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
good interest but not people rushing in
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
to say we want to have a sports book
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
location and
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're also watching not only what we
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
do here in new hampshire
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislatively what's happening in
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
legislatively what's happening in
massachusetts

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
i think they've got a sports betting
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
i think they've got a sports betting
bill

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it's always a threat
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.839 --> 00:45:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
represent names that's
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
a that's a good point
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
there wasn't there isn't super division
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think we should it's a legitimate
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
topic to discuss
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely well i think the whole
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
the whole situation about charitable
 
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
the whole situation about charitable
gaming

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
has to be looked at under a
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
whole new a whole new microscope to be
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
the thing has become much much more than
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
was ever anticipated ever
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
i mean this is not the church hall where
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh team number two conducts the games on
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
thursday night
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's right you know but they go with
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
bingo with all those volunteers
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%

made
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
to the bill but the senators find that
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
really so we go back that far
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
and the yankee things he would ban a
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
stone he didn't use the devil he said
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
the yankee fan had someone said
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i will ask for a motion to return the
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
