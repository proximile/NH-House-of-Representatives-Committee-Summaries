notter I I'm in my seventh term serving
 
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
the town of Merrimack Hillsboro District
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
12. Nick hinch our late speaker is also
 
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
from Merrimack and being the speaker is
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
the highest position you can get in the
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives so he's very
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
important to our town I think most of
 
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
you knew him I did make a copy of the
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
memorial remarks that I gave
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
our first session in Bedford last term
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I won't read it read the whole thing
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
but I did I'll leave it with you in case
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
you want to look it up just just
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
remember what a wonderful human being he
 
00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
was so today I'm wearing his pin and I I
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
helped him pick out this pin because he
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
he was looking at another one I said no
 
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
you can't have that pen he said why
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
can't I have that pin I said because
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
that's Steve shirtless pin he goes oh
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
so we found this one with an eagle in
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
the flag and then this pin is a roller
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
skate because when we I campaigned with
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney and Representative
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
Bob Healey whose wife is a Merrimack
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
Town counselor by the way and we would
 
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 align:start position:0%
listen to the 70s music when we're
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
driving around and representative
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
Mooney's too young she doesn't know any
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
of those songs so we would tease her and
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
talk about rollerblading in the 70s
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
and I I see representative Boyd just
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
stepped out um he doesn't want to cry
 
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.990 align:start position:0%
stepped out um he doesn't want to cry
okay

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
this pit bill bill Boyd representative
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
Boyd is the kinch's Legacy
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I wear this pin today
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
for that reason because we campaigned
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
for Bill who replaced reps speaker hinch
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%

bill of the babusik
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
Brook Bridge after the former New
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire speaker dick hinch
 
00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:24.019 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
we when I sat on the Merrimack Town
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
Council we the council through our
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
depart our own DPW we were able to
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
leverage our own Municipal funds with
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
DOT funds to rebuild that rebuild that
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
bridge which significantly when we'd
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a good rainstorm and and now
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
several years ago after uh 500 basically
 
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
a 500 year event occurred that entire
 
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:51.860 align:start position:0%
Road was underwater for a couple of days
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
and representative hinch's work in not
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
just that bridge but just making sure
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure was maintained in
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
our community was certainly a priority
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that he had when he sat on the board of
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
selectman in which he brought forward
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
when he was elected to the legislature
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
so in my eyes renaming that bridge after
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
the former speaker is a very befitting
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
tribute to a man that was not just
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
integral within the within the town of
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
Merrimack some of the stuff that he did
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes whether it be with
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels or with scouting
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
um dick was a quiet was a quiet person a

it is today without dick hinch being a
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
part of that process

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
those are the um the only persons I have
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
testifying uh today on House Bill 20
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's that's the same one
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we traditionally as a committee
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
um would would like to uh exec
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
immediately after a naming bill and we
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
typically do especially if we were to
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
have family members in the room and so
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
forth but one of our one of our hard and
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
fast for
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
many many sessions is that we will not
 
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
many many sessions is that we will not
vote

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on a naming bill without a
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
letter from whatever the town structure
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
is whether it be Selectmen or counsel in
 
00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:02.779 align:start position:0%
your in your point I'm I'm a rural guy
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
so I think we will
 
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.150 align:start position:0%
so I think we will
um

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
instead of closing the hearing I think
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
we'll just put it into recess for now
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
but before we do I would like to take a
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
moment we just stand and recognize
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
dick hinch who gave an awful lot to this
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
so we will uh without objection we'll
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
recess out of the first hearing uh hb20
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.490 align:start position:0%

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%

not stay in committee here to that time
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
if you want to go get a cup of coffee
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
and walk around I will say though we
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
passed around
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
um a document concerning the naming of
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
little Haystack
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
or 1 30 hearing on House Bill 213 in our
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
able committee researcher Chris there
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
she is in the corner has um I've caught
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
I've copied you in on a correspondence
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
her and I had uh Marty and other and
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
Mike and others on the committee had uh
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh whether or not we could be
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
naming a federal a mountain on a federal
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
piece of property and Christie's
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
research leads us to believe uh that
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're not able to do that
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
and this morning she had brought to
 
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:39.740 align:start position:0%
light that um
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
Christy would you mind just saying that
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:51.310 align:start position:0%

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
so so there is a path forward if uh if
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
they were to feel uh the need to uh go
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
further with that uh so it's there for
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
your information you can see it ahead of
 
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.370 align:start position:0%
your information you can see it ahead of
time

in committee for 10 40.
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%

00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
a rallying point for his uh troops he's

subsequent battle at Saratoga
 
00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:58.220 align:start position:0%
was the one that um
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:40.940 align:start position:0%
important figure in the uh
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
pre-civil War

Forest Greeley
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
and others
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
these two Bridges
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
were constructed in 1924.
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be a hundred years
 
01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:01.430 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be a hundred years
old

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
next year and both of them because of
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
their superstructure
 
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:11.180 align:start position:0%
are not considered really safe
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
when trailers trailer trucks have to go
 
01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.329 align:start position:0%
when trailers trailer trucks have to go
through

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
they have to wait till there isn't any
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
oncoming traffic
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
boxes are so high
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't wouldn't wouldn't clear
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
the superstructure of the bridge so they
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
have to swing into the middle of the
 
01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.329 align:start position:0%
have to swing into the middle of the
road

01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
swing back
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
and do repeat the process when they get
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
to the other side of the bridge
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
and although the construction of this
 
01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:53.059 align:start position:0%
bridge has been delayed
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of like many other things a
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
labor shortage
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
um and it was supposed to be open for
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
traffic in October of 2024
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
I mean that has now been delighted laid
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
too early in
 
01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:14.750 align:start position:0%
too early in
um

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.410 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:17.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%

corporate memory history is on a certain
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
topic we can certainly do that and that
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
keeps me from having to do my least
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
favorite thing in the whole world which
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
is to come to a committee and say that
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
we don't support something that's
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
designed to support veterans so uh if
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
you if you want to come see us want to
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
come to one of our meetings we can
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh set that up for you
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
Our Hope in a bill like this is that
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
somebody will drive by and will see this
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
young man's name on a on a placard and
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
will decide to do what I did which is go

as soon as we have that letter
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the town is in full
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
support then we will exec on that so we
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
will recess at this point in time I had
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
a communication from someone earlier and
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's your bill or not
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
that someone's working actually to get
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
us a letter for one of these today so
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we might we might get to that
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
after lunch
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
um so we'll re recess out of this till
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
we get further information
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
for the committee members the new
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
a couple items in this bill hit it on
 
01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
the head and it talks about the signage
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
number two uh cost of design
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
construction maintenance and
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
installation of any signage or markers
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
required in a sack shall not be charged
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the state so when when
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
people are coming forward and proposing
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
the state is not going to pay for that
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
Monument so it's important it's in
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
almost all of these and if it's not we
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
usually ask that in the second item
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
being that we're looking for the town to
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
recognize that they're in favor of The
 
01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:57.470 align:start position:0%
recognize that they're in favor of The
Proposal

01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
Proposal
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
so any questions from the committee on
 
01:27:59.639 --> 01:28:02.090 align:start position:0%
so any questions from the committee on
that

01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay so seeing none
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
11 15 we're back at one o'clock
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
so the committee will be in recess until
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
for the committee and I apologize for
 
03:04:25.969 --> 03:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
wrong side like this all right thank you
 
03:04:31.370 --> 03:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
it takes a while okay let's start over
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
again uh I will call the committee to
 
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
order and the hearing for our next bill
 
03:04:39.290 --> 03:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 412 re-establishing a
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
commission to study Revenue alternatives
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
to the road toll for funding of
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
improvements to the state's highways and
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
bridges and their resulting improvements
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
and I will call upon the prime sponsor
 
03:04:56.929 --> 03:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:15.530 --> 03:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman illustrious members of
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways
 
03:05:21.730 --> 03:05:21.740 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm here to introduce uh House Bill
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
412 which is reestablishing a commission
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
to study Revenue alternatives to the
 
03:05:30.889 --> 03:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
road toll for funding of improvements to
 
03:05:33.530 --> 03:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
State highways and bridges and their
 
03:05:37.450 --> 03:05:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
I was um I was named uh chairman we met
 
03:05:45.769 --> 03:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
we met last uh in this in the fall of
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:48.429 align:start position:0%
this year
um

03:05:48.429 --> 03:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
on this subject matter but we only had
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
time uh to meet one or two times and it
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
was time to report the bill out
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
for the newer members of the committee
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um they with with vehicles becoming so
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
efficient these days in high mileage or
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
miles to the gallon
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have less and less road toll money
 
03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we're taking in the gas tax the
 
03:06:21.410 --> 03:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
percentage you pay for the state fee
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately our infrastructure
 
03:06:26.650 --> 03:06:26.660 align:start position:0%
continues to be not in the best shape
 
03:06:30.290 --> 03:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
and with uh decreasing Revenue coming in
 
03:06:33.610 --> 03:06:33.620 align:start position:0%
and that being one of our major sources
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
for that funding we need to explore how
 
03:06:39.790 --> 03:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to go forward
 
03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
to make up that Revenue loss there's a
 
03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
second issue in here that the federal
 
03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
government is mandating in many states
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
are mandating the end of the internal
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
combustion engine and we're moving to an
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
electric model
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
and once again presently electric cars
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
aren't paying a fee that that is helping
 
03:07:09.769 --> 03:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
us subsidize our roads and highways
 
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had several bills over
 
03:07:17.450 --> 03:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
the years on uh trying to um
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
trying to adjust registration rates so
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we could make up some of that
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue but it's fallen on deaf ears
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
with the legislature
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
so we have a we have a great working
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
group we just didn't get there in time
 
03:07:39.290 --> 03:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
and the speaker is dead set well you
 
03:07:40.849 --> 03:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
might you might have heard that he
 
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't like commissions
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
and um this is one that um that he is in
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
favor of we have a tremendous group
 
03:07:49.979 --> 03:07:51.250 align:start position:0%
favor of we have a tremendous group
being

03:07:51.250 --> 03:07:51.260 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
Des working with us
 
03:07:54.319 --> 03:07:56.050 align:start position:0%
Des working with us
and

03:07:56.050 --> 03:07:56.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:58.330 --> 03:07:58.340 align:start position:0%
a good staff
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to continue our
 
03:08:03.889 --> 03:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
work and we know that it's important
 
03:08:06.050 --> 03:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
enough that we are trying to get this
 
03:08:09.170 --> 03:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
done early so we can get it before the
 
03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislature so we can go back and and
 
03:08:16.610 --> 03:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
find these sources to help our highway
 
03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:17.750 align:start position:0%
find these sources to help our highway
system

03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
and with that there are others I believe
 
03:08:22.670 --> 03:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
that are going to speak to this matter I
 
03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that representative evil is
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
going to be here she was a long-term
 
03:08:28.990 --> 03:08:29.000 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
could you explain what you know uh
 
03:08:49.969 --> 03:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
let's say what the emphasis of this
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee is commission is uh looking at
 
03:08:56.090 --> 03:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
sort of the overall
 
03:08:58.969 --> 03:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
shortfall in terms of funding needs and
 
03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
also different ways of making it a more
 
03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:03.290 align:start position:0%
also different ways of making it a more
fair

03:09:03.290 --> 03:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
fair
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
distribution are you doing both of those
 
03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
things or what what's the balance there
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes not only how are we going to make
 
03:09:15.650 --> 03:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
up that shortfall but long term what are
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
we going to do going forward to keep the
 
03:09:21.769 --> 03:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
system financially viable
 
03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
there there I believe there's others DS
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
will speak to it on some of the other
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
issues uh but we're definitely trying to
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the commission
 
03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:44.929 align:start position:0%
is the commission
considering

03:09:44.929 --> 03:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
the weight of a vehicle just like they
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.950 --> 03:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
cars being the same way electric
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles go away an awful lot more than
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
pres presently
 
03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:01.250 align:start position:0%
pres presently
um

03:10:01.250 --> 03:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh the trucking industry and so forth
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
during registration fees is paying a
 
03:10:09.290 --> 03:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
higher amount I don't know if that helps
 
03:10:11.530 --> 03:10:11.540 align:start position:0%
in the question
 
03:10:14.030 --> 03:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh just wondering if they're considering
 
03:10:26.809 --> 03:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman
 
03:10:32.330 --> 03:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
what is going on here okay thank you uh
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you the chair of the
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
the last three members are sort of out
 
03:10:40.490 --> 03:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the legislature's control are these
 
03:10:42.650 --> 03:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
are these is this the exact same
 
03:10:44.570 --> 03:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
composition that you had and are all the
 
03:10:46.370 --> 03:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
members identified so they can get right
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
to work and get appointed
 
03:10:51.170 --> 03:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:10:53.570 --> 03:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I believe there is one person that
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
wasn't re-elected from ways and means
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we would have to make up for but
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
um all the other appointments have been
 
03:11:02.809 --> 03:11:02.819 align:start position:0%
made in the past and my understanding
 
03:11:04.490 --> 03:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
are going to stay
 
03:11:08.809 --> 03:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh the um there is an additional member
 
03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's being added a request to be added
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
here which would be a member from the
 
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
public also so there could be input so
 
03:11:19.330 --> 03:11:19.340 align:start position:0%
that is the new one
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
the loan please
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
so by road toll you mean could you just
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
give me the we're talking about the
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
actual tolls as well on the on route
 
03:11:44.050 --> 03:11:44.060 align:start position:0%
on the highways or
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative we're talking about the
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
fee that you pay at the pump uh when you
 
03:11:53.450 --> 03:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
buy a gallon of gasoline road toll
 
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
I I have another go right ahead sorry
 
03:11:58.490 --> 03:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
could I have a do a follow-up go ahead
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
please so would that commission consider
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the actual tolls that we pay
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative I didn't hear
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
the last part of your question so the
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
another source of Revenue are the tolls
 
03:12:13.610 --> 03:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
that are paid on Route 3 and and on
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
Route 93 and on Route 95. so is that
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion as well or for
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
consideration for generating revenues
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you they told the tolls are on the
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
and the Turnpike system funding unless
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm incorrect is as a separate source of
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
money so that won't be there perhaps if
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
I what I should have read was this
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph if you wouldn't mind Mr
 
03:12:39.889 --> 03:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
chairman go ahead please we are to study
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
the alternatives to the road toll for
 
03:12:44.929 --> 03:12:44.939 align:start position:0%
electric powered High Hybrid and fuel
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
efficient vehicles and then study the
 
03:12:50.330 --> 03:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle fuels and Technologies
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
for funding improvements to the state
 
03:12:55.849 --> 03:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
highways and bridges ensuring that all
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles contribute proportionally
 
03:13:01.370 --> 03:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
to their impact on New Hampshire's
 
03:13:03.230 --> 03:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
Highway infrastructure including
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
Vehicles registered out of state that
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
may now no longer be subject to the road
 
03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:09.950 align:start position:0%
may now no longer be subject to the road
toll

03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
toll
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
03:13:15.889 --> 03:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
any further questions okay thank you I
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
guess representative McConkey your
 
03:13:20.450 --> 03:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
excuse so who's uh I will now call upon
 
03:13:24.250 --> 03:13:24.260 align:start position:0%
the next uh person to testify our former
 
03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative and former chair of this
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh The Honorable John Graham
 
03:13:35.210 --> 03:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's kind of unusual to be
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
City at this end of the spectrum but
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's good to see a lot of you again uh
 
03:13:48.410 --> 03:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
as many of you know I have supported and
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored LED similar legislation in the
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
past in fact I was involved both of the
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
studies 2010 and 2012 that are mentioned
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
in this uh particular piece of
 
03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:02.210 align:start position:0%
in this uh particular piece of
legislation

03:14:02.210 --> 03:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
this study is key to the future of our
 
03:14:07.550 --> 03:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
highway system in my opinion make no
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
mistake I'll turn in the fuels primarily
 
03:14:13.370 --> 03:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
Electric in the near term will continue
 
03:14:16.130 --> 03:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
to lessen our Highway funding through
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
the current roll toll system
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at what's happening every
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
year what we take in from gasoline and
 
03:14:29.809 --> 03:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
Diesel taxes goes down uh by a certain
 
03:14:29.819 --> 03:14:32.650 align:start position:0%
Diesel taxes goes down uh by a certain
percentage

03:14:32.650 --> 03:14:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
what we have done for the last several
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
terms is take money from the general
 
03:14:42.290 --> 03:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
fund to plug the the shortfall
 
03:14:42.300 --> 03:14:45.410 align:start position:0%
fund to plug the the shortfall
um

03:14:45.410 --> 03:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:48.530 --> 03:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
simply stated fully electric vehicles
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
pay virtually nothing to the maintenance
 
03:14:56.210 --> 03:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
and upkeep of our existing Road system
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
yet the New Hampshire dot is posed to
 
03:15:01.610 --> 03:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
spend millions of dollars some 17
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
million in the last 10-year plan alone
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
and establishing a network of vehicle
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
electric charging stations across the
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
state we used
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
in his vehicle not a single penny of
 
03:15:18.889 --> 03:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
that charge goes to our Highway fund so
 
03:15:21.950 --> 03:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
he's using the roads but not paying as I
 
03:15:25.210 --> 03:15:25.220 align:start position:0%
do for my fully gasoline car
 
03:15:28.490 --> 03:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
we need to fix this we need to find a
 
03:15:31.550 --> 03:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
way to ensure that everybody using our
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
roads pays a portion of the upkeep and
 
03:15:39.230 --> 03:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance and to a certain extent the
 
03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
expansion of the highway system
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
I know some of you have signed uh pledge
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
concerning new or raising taxes or fees
 
03:15:51.170 --> 03:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
I would point out that this is a study
 
03:15:53.870 --> 03:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity to look at and
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps find solutions to the current
 
03:15:59.090 --> 03:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
problem is now I would urge you to
 
03:16:01.370 --> 03:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
support this bill and see what
 
03:16:03.410 --> 03:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations can come from the
 
03:16:03.420 --> 03:16:04.370 align:start position:0%
recommendations can come from the
commission

03:16:04.370 --> 03:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
one final note Mr chairman I would
 
03:16:09.469 --> 03:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
consider changing the date of the final
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
report to November 1st 2024 with an
 
03:16:16.610 --> 03:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
interim report due this November veteran
 
03:16:18.650 --> 03:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
members of the house will realize that
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
if HB 412 is signed into law it will be
 
03:16:24.650 --> 03:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
summer before it can become effective
 
03:16:27.769 --> 03:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
and probably late summer before the
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
members are actually named by the
 
03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
speaker or the various
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
listing there of the Automobile Dealers
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
Association or wherever
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
I would suggest an interim study this
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
November in case there is something that
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to put in the legislation
 
03:16:47.929 --> 03:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
for 2024.
 
03:16:47.939 --> 03:16:49.429 align:start position:0%
for 2024.
um

03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:51.530 --> 03:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
and also if you take out the fact that
 
03:16:54.530 --> 03:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
the house precedent is not to meet in
 
03:16:57.910 --> 03:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
August you lose a whole nother month of
 
03:17:01.730 --> 03:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
2023. so it doesn't leave a lot of time
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
to work on a
 
03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
real study I mean we can do
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
putting lipstick on that pig as the
 
03:17:14.570 --> 03:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
saying goes but to do a real study I
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
think you're going to need the whole
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
year and a half and everybody actually
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
looking at it thank you for
 
03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:22.550 align:start position:0%
looking at it thank you for
consideration

03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:23.389 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:26.450 --> 03:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony okay thank
 
03:17:28.370 --> 03:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
you former representative Graham any
 
03:17:30.170 --> 03:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
questions of the former I don't have to
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
take the Vietnam right absolutely well
 
03:17:34.610 --> 03:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's up to a represent Faulkner but I
 
03:17:34.620 --> 03:17:35.330 align:start position:0%
it's up to a represent Faulkner but I
will

03:17:35.330 --> 03:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
well thank you for taking my question
 
03:17:40.130 --> 03:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
um I know in the past when this has come
 
03:17:41.450 --> 03:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
up one of the
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
arguments brought up is that
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
raising the fee charged electric
 
03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
vehicles would discourage their
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
their adoption I think that perhaps
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
events over the last year have changed
 
03:17:55.010 --> 03:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
that quite a bit is that something that
 
03:17:58.130 --> 03:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh one is that changes the dynamic but
 
03:17:59.330 --> 03:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
also May
 
03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
say that we need to get going in order
 
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
to get ahead of the game last year when
 
03:18:06.230 --> 03:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
we were looking at this very issue when
 
03:18:08.929 --> 03:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
I was sitting on the other side
 
03:18:12.769 --> 03:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
um it was the first time that
 
03:18:12.779 --> 03:18:13.370 align:start position:0%
um it was the first time that
um

03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
some of the environmental groups des and
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
others came in and supported at least
 
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
looking at this problem
 
03:18:24.170 --> 03:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are going to be a
 
03:18:25.969 --> 03:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
major factor in the future of
 
03:18:30.889 --> 03:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
Transportation in this this country even
 
03:18:33.490 --> 03:18:33.500 align:start position:0%
um tractors and trailers are now being
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
developed and tested that are fully
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
electric so to stick our head in the
 
03:18:42.170 --> 03:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
sand is not it I think the time is now
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
to study it and see where we go always
 
03:18:51.050 --> 03:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
before before last term it was always we
 
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay anymore because
 
03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're saving the planet but if you're
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
not paying for the roads then you're
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
going to be driving on gravel again so
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
a mix here and we're paid not wheat you
 
03:19:10.730 --> 03:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
guys are paid to make the serious
 
03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
guys are paid to make the serious
um

03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
policy decisions on how we're going to
 
03:19:14.279 --> 03:19:16.130 align:start position:0%
policy decisions on how we're going to
maintain

03:19:16.130 --> 03:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:19:19.090 --> 03:19:19.100 align:start position:0%
um our road system throughout the state
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
without having to rely on the fact that
 
03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have a surplus that we can
 
03:19:27.290 --> 03:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
plug 50 million dollars of general fund
 
03:19:30.889 --> 03:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
money into the highway fund for uh for
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
upkeep of our system
 
03:19:36.889 --> 03:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you former Senator Graham any
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
other questions uh yes go ahead please
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um okay I didn't I'll take you and then
 
03:19:43.490 --> 03:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
go if you don't mind I'm sorry I didn't
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's basically first who I see first go
 
03:19:47.690 --> 03:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
ahead please okay thank you thank you
 
03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I want to ask you of your historical
 
03:19:55.130 --> 03:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
nature how long has this commission been
 
03:19:55.140 --> 03:19:56.450 align:start position:0%
nature how long has this commission been
active

03:19:56.450 --> 03:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
active
 
03:19:59.210 --> 03:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
there this commission was only active
 
03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
last term
 
03:20:02.929 --> 03:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
um it came out of a whole different
 
03:20:02.939 --> 03:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
um it came out of a whole different
process

03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately it did not was not
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
able to meet we did it in an election
 
03:20:14.090 --> 03:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
year and so it did not meet all that
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
often and the real recommendation of the
 
03:20:19.610 --> 03:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
the commission at that point was to kick
 
03:20:21.730 --> 03:20:21.740 align:start position:0%
the cannon and
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
re-reestablish it in this year the
 
03:20:26.090 --> 03:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
problem of funding
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
has been around for over 20 years my
 
03:20:32.230 --> 03:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
first term in
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
2001 uh maybe 2002 then speaker Chandler
 
03:20:40.250 --> 03:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
appointed myself and several members of
 
03:20:43.130 --> 03:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
this committee to a study committee to
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
look at funding of road toll and how we
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
were going to pay for I-95
 
03:20:47.819 --> 03:20:49.910 align:start position:0%
were going to pay for I-95
um

03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.889 --> 03:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get any better it
 
03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't gotten any better in 20 some
 
03:20:57.050 --> 03:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
years we need to look at that the only
 
03:20:59.330 --> 03:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
bright spot that I've seen in 20 years
 
03:21:04.130 --> 03:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
is we managed to figure out a way to do
 
03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:04.910 align:start position:0%
is we managed to figure out a way to do
um

03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh propane and other Natural Gas
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
powered vehicles and how they would pay
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
um into the road toll and I would make
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
that very clear that we need to make
 
03:21:20.450 --> 03:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
sure that if we do something that that
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
money goes into the road toll in law and
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
not part of the general fund because the
 
03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
people down the hall if they see it in
 
03:21:33.050 --> 03:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
general fund it's up for them to decide
 
03:21:35.210 --> 03:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
how to use it
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right yes representative Newman and
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
followed by uh representative Bogart go
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
ahead police yes thank you for taking my
 
03:21:43.319 --> 03:21:44.170 align:start position:0%
ahead police yes thank you for taking my
question

03:21:44.170 --> 03:21:44.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
has the car seat Institute or would they
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
or have they been able to contribute
 
03:21:54.230 --> 03:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
anything to the commission's work the
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
car seat I think that's the car seat
 
03:22:00.230 --> 03:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
Institute from una studies not to my
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge but if the commission wanted
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
to ask for some help from from them or
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is always offering to help
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
with things to the to this committee
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
um then they're welcome to do that but
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that they'll take
 
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
up the challenge
 
03:22:22.130 --> 03:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bogart
 
03:22:22.140 --> 03:22:23.090 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bogart
please

03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:26.690 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
um

03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
has it been considered to get rid of the
 
03:22:35.090 --> 03:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
fee altogether for uh oil-based products
 
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
our combustion engines and stuff and
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
then go to a mileage charge and that way
 
03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
you don't rely on any uh
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
as we grow in the future the different
 
03:22:52.610 --> 03:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
vehicles and what propels them is going
 
03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
to be different as we move so it it has
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
been considered I I've been on studies
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
that have looked at uh vehicle miles
 
03:23:05.170 --> 03:23:05.180 align:start position:0%
traveled formula the the real problem
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we encounter with that other than
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the political side is the fact that we
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
are a small state and a lot of our
 
03:23:20.110 --> 03:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
citizens travel and work in other states
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
so unless you have some kind of compact
 
03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:25.130 align:start position:0%
so unless you have some kind of compact
with

03:23:25.130 --> 03:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:23:25.140 --> 03:23:26.570 align:start position:0%
with
um

03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:29.809 --> 03:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
surrounding states or a national vehicle
 
03:23:31.990 --> 03:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
while traveled formula
 
03:23:36.769 --> 03:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
we end up trying to determine okay John
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
Graham you travel 50 000 miles last year
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
but I claim that 40 000 of it was out of
 
03:23:45.650 --> 03:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
state so should I have to pay for all
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand since I'm paying gas tax
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
in in a different state that's the
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
nutshell of the whole vehicle miles
 
03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
traveled problem is that it is
 
03:23:58.680 --> 03:23:59.389 align:start position:0%
traveled problem is that it is
um

03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
based on
 
03:24:06.170 --> 03:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
total travel and how do I differentiate
 
03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing in New Hampshire to pay
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire road toll as
 
03:24:13.729 --> 03:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
opposed to what I'm doing outside of the
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
state and that's particularly true if we
 
03:24:20.090 --> 03:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
start getting big rigs that are fully
 
03:24:23.690 --> 03:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
electric which is not in that far in the
 
03:24:23.700 --> 03:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
electric which is not in that far in the
future

03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you uh further
 
03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
questions a former representative Graham
 
03:24:32.570 --> 03:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay scene on thank you very much for
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
because I think this is one of the bills
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to exec
 
03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:44.510 align:start position:0%

03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:28.849 --> 03:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%

03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
03:26:52.969 --> 03:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
the chairman I think this is probably
 
03:26:54.769 --> 03:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
the one of the most important bills that
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with today certainly
 
03:26:59.450 --> 03:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to do what we can to
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
expedite this pass this bill today if no
 
03:27:04.370 --> 03:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
one objects and then send to the house
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
for for a vote next Thursday and
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully the house can pass it with not
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
little or no debate and send it to the
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
Senate and you know hopefully the Senate
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
will act on in the next month or so
 
03:27:15.889 --> 03:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
because we've got to get this commission
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
re-established as a member of this
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
commission I want plenty of time to
 
03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
study this whole problem and if we're
 
03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
going to meet a deadline on November 1st
 
03:27:27.650 --> 03:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
2023 I think we've got to do it as soon
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%

03:27:29.640 --> 03:27:31.309 align:start position:0%

representative
 
03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
yes I just wondered if um you if we
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to amend
 
03:27:39.050 --> 03:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:27:40.490 --> 03:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
um two
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
is former
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Graham indicated that to change
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:58.010 --> 03:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.849 --> 03:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
so thank you I I um I stepped out in the
 
03:28:03.769 --> 03:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
hallway with representative Graham
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Graham and asked him where he
 
03:28:10.130 --> 03:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
and his his thought was that I believe
 
03:28:12.170 --> 03:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
he was saying to keep an interim report
 
03:28:16.450 --> 03:28:16.460 align:start position:0%
for November 1st 2023 and a final for
 
03:28:21.290 --> 03:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
2024 November okay that that was his
 
03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:22.670 align:start position:0%
2024 November okay that that was his
suggestion

03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
are are you looking to make an amendment
 
03:28:28.610 --> 03:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
to that or just discussion at this point
 
03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:34.849 align:start position:0%
to that or just discussion at this point
if

03:28:34.849 --> 03:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes representative am I
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
correct that if we do have a committee
 
03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have to send that to
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
OLS and then postpone this yeah session
 
03:28:47.690 --> 03:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I and I would I
 
03:28:49.729 --> 03:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
would like to say I'm not a big favor of
 
03:28:51.769 --> 03:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
sending things over to the other side
 
03:28:54.590 --> 03:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
the wall there to correct something but
 
03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
I think it would allow if we were to get
 
03:28:58.849 --> 03:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
this bill out today and we were to get
 
03:29:01.010 --> 03:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
it on the floor
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
um then um we can we can take further
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
action because there are members there
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
are members that are very active in the
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
Senate and if after discussion we think
 
03:29:12.769 --> 03:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
that's right we can handle it then
 
03:29:12.779 --> 03:29:14.570 align:start position:0%
that's right we can handle it then
yes

03:29:14.570 --> 03:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
you just echoed what I was going to
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
suggest thank you
 
03:29:21.530 --> 03:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
03:29:24.410 --> 03:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
one item I believe the original Bill
 
03:29:27.229 --> 03:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
1040 which set up the commission we
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
passed it and with an amendment that
 
03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner worked on and we
 
03:29:32.090 --> 03:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
sent at the Senate I think they further
 
03:29:34.130 --> 03:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
amend amended it to take out some things
 
03:29:36.410 --> 03:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh deal with some things like I think
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
they took out the Senate member I don't
 
03:29:39.530 --> 03:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
think there's any Senators on the
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
commission so it's possible that the
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
Senate could very well amend it you know
 
03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
and with some of the suggestions right
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
former representative Graham suggested
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%

03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
right to it I'm originally from kowas
 
03:39:36.410 --> 03:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
County uh New Hampshire's True North
 
03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
Country uh Groveton High School grad one
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
of my classmates fathers one of my
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
classmates father he had one father it
 
03:39:47.630 --> 03:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
was a conservation officer up in the
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
North Country his name is Arthur Muse
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
when he retired a mountain in northern
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
coast County was named after him and you
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
can find Muse Mountain on a map today
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so Mr Muse retired they had a
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
testimonial for him my friend's dad and
 
03:40:05.210 --> 03:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
when he spoke at his testimonial he
 
03:40:06.889 --> 03:40:06.899 align:start position:0%
thanked all concern for naming a
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
mountain after him
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and he said that he'd earlier driven
 
03:40:13.190 --> 03:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
by the mountain with his kids to show
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
them the mountain that now bore the
 
03:40:18.889 --> 03:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
family name uh but at the testimony he
 
03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
said he had one concern about the
 
03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
process he shared that when they drove
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
by the newly named Muse Mountain he
 
03:40:28.190 --> 03:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
noticed it was significant logging and
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
lumbering operations going on on one of
 
03:40:33.050 --> 03:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
the mountains slopes so he then posed a
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
question that Drew some laughter at the
 
03:40:37.010 --> 03:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
testimonial he asked
 
03:40:39.050 --> 03:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
why are all these people cutting trees
 
03:40:40.729 --> 03:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
down on my Mountain without my
 
03:40:40.739 --> 03:40:41.630 align:start position:0%
down on my Mountain without my
permission

03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
permission
 
03:40:43.849 --> 03:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
so he indeed had a sense of humor but
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
significantly uh the mountain stayed in
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
his Muse Mountain not but not arthimus
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
Mountain Muse Mountain it was a way to
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
honor the entire family which ties into
 
03:40:55.859 --> 03:40:57.229 align:start position:0%
honor the entire family which ties into
this

03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
um Arthur Muse's parents lived in
 
03:41:03.769 --> 03:41:03.779 align:start position:0%
Bristol and his dad was a World War one
 
03:41:06.769 --> 03:41:06.779 align:start position:0%
hero who did some amazing things in the
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
trenches in no man's land in World War
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
One the Great War and he was awarded the
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
Victoria Cross that's Britain's highest
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
award for Valor he was given this medal
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
by the king of England
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
in a special ceremony so Muse Mountain
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
was a way to honor the whole family and
 
03:41:27.290 --> 03:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
indeed uh far beyond the single
 
03:41:27.300 --> 03:41:28.309 align:start position:0%
indeed uh far beyond the single
individual

03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the fact that I'm speaking about it
 
03:41:33.769 --> 03:41:33.779 align:start position:0%
in 2023 goes to the fact that naming
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
this mountain after after the Arthur
 
03:41:39.590 --> 03:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
Muse is a way to keep memories in
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
history alive so it brings us to HB 213
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
renaming little Haystack mountain is
 
03:41:47.450 --> 03:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
Mount Kosciuszko the intent is to honor
 
03:41:50.809 --> 03:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
Another Hero tadius casiusco polish
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
engineer Statesman military leader who
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
was a hero
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
in in Belarus France Lithuania Poland
 
03:42:00.889 --> 03:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
and the United States
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
he came to America in 1776 uh he
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
provided invaluable service to General
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
Washington and our continental army he
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
was a military architect he designed and
 
03:42:15.250 --> 03:42:15.260 align:start position:0%
oversaw the construction of of numerous
 
03:42:17.450 --> 03:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
fortifications state-of-the-art
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
fortifications to include West Point
 
03:42:23.210 --> 03:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
so when the war ended the Continental
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
Congress promoted him to General in the
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
Continental Army in 1783. so so renaming
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
little Haystack as Mount Kosciuszko is a
 
03:42:35.170 --> 03:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
wonderful way to honor a wonderful
 
03:42:38.809 --> 03:42:38.819 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War hero
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
the way that Muse Mountain
 
03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
honors the whole Muse family
 
03:42:47.090 --> 03:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
in Mount Kosciuszko if or when it
 
03:42:47.100 --> 03:42:48.590 align:start position:0%
in Mount Kosciuszko if or when it
happens

03:42:48.590 --> 03:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh would also honor our greater Polish
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
American Community I have to share that
 
03:42:56.210 --> 03:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
on my way up here uh
 
03:42:56.220 --> 03:42:57.550 align:start position:0%
on my way up here uh
Stanley

03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
Stanley
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
collegnicki you all see him downstairs
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh he's the one with the accent he's
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
down there right now and I he was aware
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
of this hearing and he was very excited
 
03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
that we're at least talking about a
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
wonderful polish or Polish American if
 
03:43:15.769 --> 03:43:15.779 align:start position:0%
you will hero
 
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and there are many the Polish
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
American Community uh of course would
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
love and embrace as he just told me
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
downstairs something like this somehow
 
03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:27.950 align:start position:0%
downstairs something like this somehow
someday

03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
someday
 
03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
um to honor their part in our history
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a history guy uh The Honorable Paul
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
mursky some of you may know uh was uh
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
from Grafton County he's been a member
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
of this house for for many many terms uh
 
03:43:44.690 --> 03:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
very supportive and excited about again
 
03:43:46.570 --> 03:43:46.580 align:start position:0%
somehow someday trying to do something
 
03:43:49.750 --> 03:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
to honor
 
03:43:53.150 --> 03:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
so anyway to finish this up out in front
 
03:43:55.070 --> 03:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
of our state house not far from the
 
03:43:58.010 --> 03:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
statue of Daniel Webster is a monument
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh it was placed here fairly recently
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
last year I think and uh it honors the
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
Marquis De Lafayette who came here from
 
03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
France to fight in our Revolutionary War
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
Lafayette was perhaps George
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
Washington's favorite General and
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
remarkably in case you didn't know the
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
Marquee General Lafayette actually once
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
addressed this legislature in our very
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh reps Hall in 1825.
 
03:44:28.010 --> 03:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
which is perhaps why he has a monument
 
03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
right out by not far from Daniel
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
Webster's statue
 
03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:33.410 align:start position:0%
Webster's statue
so

03:44:33.410 --> 03:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that his Monument is in front
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
of the state house uh is a way for us to
 
03:44:38.819 --> 03:44:39.550 align:start position:0%
of the state house uh is a way for us to
remember

03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
Lafayette who came here from France he
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
has a mountain named after him many of
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
us have been up Mount Lafayette it's on
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Franconia Ridge not too far from
 
03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:51.290 align:start position:0%
the Franconia Ridge not too far from
Haystack

03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
Haystack
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:44:55.969 --> 03:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
you know some have said we should keep
 
03:44:58.010 --> 03:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
little Haystack as a name Haystack his
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
name it's easier to say than Mount
 
03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
casuco which uh there may be some truth
 
03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
to that yeah you're right
 
03:45:06.650 --> 03:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh not looking at the chair necessarily
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
I had to practice myself
 
03:45:10.610 --> 03:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
um but you know what instrument had to
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
make a 911 call from from up there and
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
there have been some some recent deaths
 
03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
up on Frank Franconia Ridge Trail
 
03:45:19.610 --> 03:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
the loop up there
 
03:45:21.170 --> 03:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that's a
 
03:45:23.809 --> 03:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
showstopper in any sense uh is classic
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
yusco harder to say than many of the
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
indigenous Native American Indian names
 
03:45:29.870 --> 03:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
we find throughout New Hampshire uh
 
03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
Monadnock pemijowash at kanka magus
 
03:45:32.220 --> 03:45:34.190 align:start position:0%
Monadnock pemijowash at kanka magus
musalaki

03:45:34.190 --> 03:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
musalaki
 
03:45:34.200 --> 03:45:35.809 align:start position:0%
musalaki
so

03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
um but others have said that it could be
 
03:45:41.330 --> 03:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
expensive and again uh if somehow if or
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
when this hopefully somehow moves
 
03:45:44.330 --> 03:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
forward in some fashion
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh yes we'd have to eventually change
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
some names on maps and books uh that
 
03:45:51.410 --> 03:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to happen overnight these
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
things that you know happen it's a
 
03:45:55.969 --> 03:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
process and it in updating names is
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:46:00.170 --> 03:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
um sometimes takes time and doesn't
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be done immediately
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
uh on the apps or the maps
 
03:46:06.769 --> 03:46:06.779 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
03:46:10.130 --> 03:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking anyone's name down
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
in this process okay the mountain was
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
named for a haystack
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay you know what Christopher Columbus
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's not uh taking any other
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
name off the maps or off the books now
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
the of course and you know better than
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
than I do that something like this would
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
entail a need for some federal
 
03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
entail a need for some federal
um

03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:32.880 --> 03:46:34.610 align:start position:0%
um
coordination

03:46:34.610 --> 03:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
I mentioned Muse mountain and I'm not
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
sure that this property up in coax
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
County was part of the national forest I
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know how they did that I see
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
that Muse Mountain my named after my
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
friend's dad is on the map
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it's in the national
 
03:46:55.250 --> 03:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
forest and I I understand that that is
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
an issue to to address there would need
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be some coordination with the
 
03:47:00.830 --> 03:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
Department of the Interior but there are
 
03:47:02.929 --> 03:47:02.939 align:start position:0%
processes and as someone said earlier
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
today if we can put a man on the moon
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
why not put Thaddeus Casa usko's name on
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
the mountain so anyway uh thank you for
 
03:47:12.769 --> 03:47:12.779 align:start position:0%
your time and attention I was happy to
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%

03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%

03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%

03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%

you support it so please go ahead
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative dutse it was a fast drive
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
up from Nashville and I was very lucky
 
03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
okay yes we we very much appreciate it
 
03:48:36.180 --> 03:48:37.849 align:start position:0%
okay yes we we very much appreciate it
anyway

03:48:37.849 --> 03:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you colleagues
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
um for hearing this bill uh I presented
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill on behalf of a
 
03:48:48.050 --> 03:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
constituent uh and my constituents are
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
here uh Mr draza and his son to
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
recognize again uh General Thaddeus and
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
I always pronounce it kashuko okay so
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that may be a wrong
 
03:49:02.090 --> 03:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
um but in understanding the contribution
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
he made to the Revolutionary War and the
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
fact that I don't think little Haystack
 
03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:08.510 align:start position:0%
fact that I don't think little Haystack
really

03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:49:11.150 --> 03:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
um represents anything historical I
 
03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good idea to go ahead
 
03:49:15.010 --> 03:49:15.020 align:start position:0%
and and file the bill
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding in doing the research
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
is that on the state level we can change
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
the name of the mountain however in
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
order for it to
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
um be recognized it would have to go
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
through the federal government through
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
the board of geographic names and then
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
that would be something that we would
 
03:49:39.790 --> 03:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
have to prepare for I contacted the
 
03:49:42.410 --> 03:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Mountain Club to see if they
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
had any concerns about it and they are
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
neutral on the naming of the bill I also
 
03:49:53.450 --> 03:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
contacted a fish and game and some of
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
their rescue Personnel to see if they
 
03:49:58.130 --> 03:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
had an issue with it
 
03:50:00.290 --> 03:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect there is an
 
03:50:03.610 --> 03:50:03.620 align:start position:0%
issue with the pemi search and rescue
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they do plan on sending a a response
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
however I did give him the the date of
 
03:50:15.410 --> 03:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
February 3rd so
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it's not in preparation for this
 
03:50:21.290 --> 03:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
meeting yesterday I also contacted the
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
State library to try to to have them do
 
03:50:27.490 --> 03:50:27.500 align:start position:0%
some research on
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
the general kosuko to see if he had
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
fought for us actually in New Hampshire
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
and to get any background on little
 
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
Haystack that hasn't come to me yet but
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
when it does I'll forward it over to the
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee so I've tried to do my due
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
diligence on this I think it's a good
 
03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:48.590 align:start position:0%
diligence on this I think it's a good
idea

03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
um the Polish diaspora in the United
 
03:50:54.530 --> 03:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
States is the second largest outside of
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
Poland outside of Warsaw I believe
 
03:51:00.050 --> 03:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so I think to recognize them would be
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
a great honor for the State of New
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for all of our polish
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%

03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
did all the research representative
 
03:52:32.929 --> 03:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
Moffett has gave him the history I will
 
03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
be real short
 
03:52:39.410 --> 03:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
Thaddeus has been worldwide known
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
from the mount the highest mountain
 
03:52:41.040 --> 03:52:46.550 align:start position:0%
from the mount the highest mountain

03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
to all of Europe almost he he refused to
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
work with Napoleon
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the Tsar Alexander the first because
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
they would not do give any guarantees
 
03:53:02.690 --> 03:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
for liberty or social form reforms for
 
03:53:05.929 --> 03:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
the serfs and the indentured servants
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
throughout his life
 
03:53:17.630 --> 03:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
all of his efforts
 
03:53:17.640 --> 03:53:19.670 align:start position:0%
all of his efforts
in

03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
let's just say battle was for civil
 
03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:24.590 align:start position:0%
let's just say battle was for civil
change

03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:53:27.530 --> 03:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for his nobility it wasn't for
 
03:53:29.450 --> 03:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
government it was for the people
 
03:53:35.410 --> 03:53:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.490 --> 03:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
um represent Moffett mentioned but he
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
fought throughout the colonies in South
 
03:53:46.969 --> 03:53:46.979 align:start position:0%
and North Carolina also he's a very
 
03:53:46.979 --> 03:53:48.469 align:start position:0%
and North Carolina also he's a very
um

03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
important in protecting some people with
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
his engineering skills crossing rivers I
 
03:53:55.190 --> 03:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
believe that was in North Carolina I'm
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
not the history major so
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add to it
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
that the the penny rescue and others I
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
had emails from
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
was concerned about the pronunciation of
 
03:54:10.610 --> 03:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
name the change on search and rescue
 
03:54:13.849 --> 03:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
I've been in the EMS for 44 years active
 
03:54:13.859 --> 03:54:14.950 align:start position:0%
I've been in the EMS for 44 years active
since

03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:54:20.210 --> 03:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
1973 till my retirement in 2015 because
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
my move from Grafton to
 
03:54:26.570 --> 03:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
a town to Center Harbor Center Harbor
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
has commercial
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
and they need a fire cert one for their
 
03:54:36.170 --> 03:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
fire uh at this age I'm not going to do
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
my cert one training
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
now being a dispatcher in EMS
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm back from the old
 
03:54:47.570 --> 03:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
switch toggle before the cad systems I'm
 
03:54:50.090 --> 03:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
not up to the enhanced 9-1-1
 
03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
that this is even more improved we have
 
03:54:55.319 --> 03:54:56.689 align:start position:0%
that this is even more improved we have
always

03:54:56.689 --> 03:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
always
 
03:54:59.210 --> 03:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
had duplicate names if you had to change
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
shames that was there by the toggle for
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
years I can still see the paper and it
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
taped over many times of the old names
 
03:55:11.689 --> 03:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
or an area
 
03:55:13.969 --> 03:55:13.979 align:start position:0%
so when someone calls in and they say
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know I'm stuck
 
03:55:18.410 --> 03:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
I took this trailhead
 
03:55:21.170 --> 03:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
dispatch I am assuming if it's like
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
everyone I worked from there you know
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
where you're going
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
and from that point on you can get any
 
03:55:32.330 --> 03:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
other little details the old name little
 
03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:34.729 align:start position:0%
other little details the old name little
haystack

03:55:34.729 --> 03:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
haystack
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's been changed three years ago that
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
should be in a cad system still as a
 
03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
historical name so with that I don't see
 
03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
any problem with the search and rescue
 
03:55:49.010 --> 03:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to bring that that's my
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
main thing here
 
03:55:52.849 --> 03:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
um since the other two Representatives
 
03:55:55.370 --> 03:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
sponsors covered most everything and I
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me this time
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
and for questions thank you sir any
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
next and I'm probably going to murder
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
this last name again Mr Daryl derezia of
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
okay so if unless anybody objects you if
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
you want to both come up at the same
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
time I have two separate cards but it'll
 
03:56:31.969 --> 03:56:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.530 --> 03:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay you have some yeah if you have
 
03:56:41.150 --> 03:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:54.170 --> 03:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
all right all set all set yes sure okay
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for the opportunity to
 
03:56:57.170 --> 03:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
speak here just to make it quick uh to
 
03:56:58.729 --> 03:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
give you a quick uh story of the whole
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
idea here uh I'm a life lifelong New
 
03:57:03.290 --> 03:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident and lifelong hiker of
 
03:57:04.250 --> 03:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains they're very
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
important to me I you know uh
 
03:57:09.050 --> 03:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
and in recently reading uh some of the
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
history of the Revolutionary War I I
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
read a lot in depth about Kosciusko the
 
03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
character and his his life story
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
and the sort of a light bulb just went
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
off in my head when I looked at this
 
03:57:20.929 --> 03:57:20.939 align:start position:0%
Ridge with with the names Lafayette
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and Liberty and how koshko fits
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly to me with those other names
 
03:57:28.610 --> 03:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
because of his similarities to Lafayette
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
and then the uh Thomas Jefferson has the
 
03:57:33.170 --> 03:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
famous quote calling Kosciusko the
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
purest son of Liberty he's ever known
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
so this Malco would be right next to
 
03:57:39.290 --> 03:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
mount Liberty
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh so it just seems to me to be a
 
03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
perfect fit uh and then also it's a
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
perfect fit for New Hampshire because of
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
our uh part because of the State slogan
 
03:57:49.010 --> 03:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh the Live Free or Die thing to me
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
because a character that really lived
 
03:57:53.689 --> 03:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
that phrase more than many people I've
 
03:57:55.010 --> 03:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
ever heard of you know fighting for
 
03:57:56.450 --> 03:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
freedom in multiple different countries
 
03:57:59.330 --> 03:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
and he also was a lifelong advocate for
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
individual freedoms uh you know he freed
 
03:58:04.130 --> 03:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh his own serfs in his home country of
 
03:58:07.130 --> 03:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
Poland he also wrote a will uh
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
dedicating all the money that he'd want
 
03:58:10.849 --> 03:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
that he'd earned fighting in our
 
03:58:13.849 --> 03:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
Revolution to free and educate as many
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
American slaves as possible
 
03:58:17.809 --> 03:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
so to me he fits in perfectly with the
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire he also
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
during he was huge in the Saratoga
 
03:58:23.929 --> 03:58:23.939 align:start position:0%
campaign of the Revolutionary War which
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
was one of the bigger uh you know parts
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the Revolutionary War with the
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
British trying to get control of the
 
03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
Hudson River
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
so he just uh you know to me he just uh
 
03:58:39.290 --> 03:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a perfect fit for our for
 
03:58:41.150 --> 03:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
our state in in the fact that he fought
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
in that Saratoga campaign he fought with
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
multiple New Hampshire regiments I know
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh John Stark a character from New
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also was huge and it was just
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
they were very uh important in stopping
 
03:58:55.010 --> 03:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
General burgoyne's Advance south from uh
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
Lake Champlain and trying to split the
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
colonies in half uh Kosciusko was just
 
03:59:01.370 --> 03:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
very important in in his his
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
contributions that he did at Fort
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
Ticonderoga and also in Saratoga which
 
03:59:07.490 --> 03:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
is where the actual final battles took
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
place and it was it was largely due from
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I understand so koshko's uh you
 
03:59:15.469 --> 03:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
know selection of that of that land the
 
03:59:16.969 --> 03:59:16.979 align:start position:0%
height and the way he utilized The High
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
Ground and just the strategy of the war
 
03:59:22.729 --> 03:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
so he was huge in in that Saratoga which
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
was actually the foot where Burgoyne
 
03:59:25.490 --> 03:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
actually surrendered I think it was the
 
03:59:27.170 --> 03:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
only time that British forces had ever
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
surrendered in the field there's uh
 
03:59:30.290 --> 03:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
something like that so
 
03:59:32.450 --> 03:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
so Kosciusko was just there's that has
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
that connection with New Hampshire
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
because uh you know he with the New
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regiments and the Live Free or
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
Die thing
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I uh
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's about it really um
 
03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
you know uh and then I know that uh you
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
know Mount Eisenhower I know was changed
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the 70s uh so it's not that something
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's been name changes that have
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
happened before
 
03:59:57.889 --> 03:59:57.899 align:start position:0%
and uh and that was changed I just feel
 
03:59:59.450 --> 03:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
like it's I just feel like when it
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
really the
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
the light bulb just went off for me when
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
I when I just looked at this Ridge that
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
we have with Lafayette Lincoln and
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
Liberty and reading about Castro's going
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
to me I was like the light bulb went off
 
04:00:11.809 --> 04:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
like he fits in perfectly with all those
 
04:00:12.830 --> 04:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
other names
 
04:00:14.809 --> 04:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
you know so I just feel like it's a good
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
idea and I feel like New Hampshire has a
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
very good opportunity here to to do this
 
04:00:19.130 --> 04:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
I know that's one of the most popular
 
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
hikes in the state thousands of people
 
04:00:23.210 --> 04:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes do it a day in the summer
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
months and you get people from all over
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are doing it so it's a very
 
04:00:29.150 --> 04:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
important uh part of our state and I
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
just feel like it's a very good
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our for our for the
 
04:00:33.889 --> 04:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to do okay thank
 
04:00:37.330 --> 04:00:37.340 align:start position:0%
you uh yours is yours
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
drazier right okay okay yeah uh so Daryl
 
04:00:45.290 --> 04:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
drazier do you want anything to add to
 
04:00:48.050 --> 04:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
Zach's testimony probably don't yeah I
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to waste time you know he
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
pretty much my son covered it pretty
 
04:00:53.450 --> 04:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
much I think if there's questions we're
 
04:00:55.130 --> 04:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
going to do and we have all right yes
 
04:00:57.530 --> 04:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely questions of either one of
 
04:01:06.250 --> 04:01:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah see none thank you for your
 
04:01:16.010 --> 04:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize I'm still getting uses
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wishes to
 
04:01:24.290 --> 04:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
testify either for or against House Bill
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
213 here today I do not have any more
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
pink cards I assume there isn't but I
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
just want to be absolutely sure because
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
we've allotted an hour for testimony on
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
this for this public hearing but before
 
04:01:39.650 --> 04:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
I close it I want to be sure everybody's
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
had a chance to testify either for or
 
04:01:42.120 --> 04:01:43.010 align:start position:0%
had a chance to testify either for or
against

04:01:43.010 --> 04:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think what we're going to do
 
04:02:14.269 --> 04:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
now at the testimony hearing didn't take
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
as long as I think we had anticipated so
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is not until 2 30 on
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
199 so I'm going to recess the public
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and I may we may have an
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
executive session later on this bill but
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to wait for a few minutes to
 
04:02:33.769 --> 04:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
see if the chair who's in another
 
04:02:36.170 --> 04:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee right now is going to come
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
back okay thank you very much everybody

Jack
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh discussion
 
04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
I would um I would like to make a couple
 
04:33:49.379 --> 04:33:51.109 align:start position:0%
I would um I would like to make a couple
comments

04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:33:51.119 --> 04:33:51.949 align:start position:0%
comments
um

04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the bill before us I understand the
 
04:33:58.929 --> 04:33:58.939 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors brought in some information
 
04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
that may have conflicted with
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
information that we had at the time or I
 
04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
should say it's more a path forward for
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
how they could rename this mountain
 
04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh there's still my understanding that
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
our our committee Public Works and
 
04:34:19.849 --> 04:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
highways cannot do that naming because
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
it's a federal property uh Federal lands
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
but it appears that if they were to move
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
on with the federal delegation
 
04:34:34.131 --> 04:34:34.141 align:start position:0%
and pursue through the
 
04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the board that they spoke of
 
04:34:42.051 --> 04:34:42.061 align:start position:0%
geological naming I apologize for uh
 
04:34:42.061 --> 04:34:43.849 align:start position:0%
geological naming I apologize for uh
being

04:34:43.849 --> 04:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
not clear on that uh but it there's
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
there seems to be from the sponsors uh
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
conversation with that geological group
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's in charge in naming Federal
 
04:34:56.929 --> 04:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
properties that that is a bit of a hill
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
to climb and they're going there's a lot
 
04:35:02.209 --> 04:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
of work that needs to be done uh to get
 
04:35:05.631 --> 04:35:05.641 align:start position:0%
there after thought perhaps the best
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle for us is to
 
04:35:13.970 --> 04:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
um is to itl this bill at this time and
 
04:35:16.090 --> 04:35:16.100 align:start position:0%
let the co-sponsors
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
move forward with the federal delegation
 
04:35:23.209 --> 04:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
the geological group and see if this is
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
something that they feel reasonably
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
assured can happen and then the
 
04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors possibly could come back
 
04:35:32.929 --> 04:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
with a house next year with a house
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
resolution that the house were to
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
support the renaming which would then be
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
a benefit to them
 
04:35:43.789 --> 04:35:43.799 align:start position:0%
with uh with the feds and with that
 
04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
geological naming group so it's I will
 
04:35:49.849 --> 04:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
be voting
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
in favor of itl is there any other
 
04:35:52.439 --> 04:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
in favor of itl is there any other
discussion

04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:35:54.240 --> 04:35:55.970 align:start position:0%
discussion
yes

04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's more of a question
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
as I am uh thank you Mr chairman uh I'm
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
not aware of what Ito means so okay
 
04:36:10.609 --> 04:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and it's uh and I
 
04:36:13.929 --> 04:36:13.939 align:start position:0%
apologize for you for myself for that
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
itl is inexpedient to legislate
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
um it ends the bill
 
04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
for this year and if someone wants to
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
bring something back next time we could
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
retain the bill that's another motion we
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
could have we could move ought to pass
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
to approve uh but with so much work to
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
be done I don't think that retaining it
 
04:36:41.689 --> 04:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
would be the right move at this time
 
04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
I would hope that our explanation in the
 
04:36:48.719 --> 04:36:49.490 align:start position:0%
I would hope that our explanation in the
uh

04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:52.849 --> 04:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
calendar would indicate that we
 
04:36:54.650 --> 04:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
don't want this to be taken as a slight
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
on Kosciusko or on the
 
04:36:58.561 --> 04:37:01.369 align:start position:0%
on Kosciusko or on the
polish

04:37:01.369 --> 04:37:01.379 align:start position:0%
polish
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
Pride that went behind this uh my
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
brother is a technical problem that
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and I think
 
04:37:12.410 --> 04:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's uh certainly Our intention of how
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
this would be worded
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
person boy yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally 2003 the legislature
 
04:37:29.449 --> 04:37:29.459 align:start position:0%
voted and enacted to change Mount clay
 
04:37:31.010 --> 04:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
to mount Reagan
 
04:37:33.650 --> 04:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
and it was seven years later when it was
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
brought before the federal Board of
 
04:37:36.410 --> 04:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
geographical names and they voted
 
04:37:38.631 --> 04:37:38.641 align:start position:0%
against changing the name of Mount clay
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
to mount Reagan so to this day when you
 
04:37:45.849 --> 04:37:45.859 align:start position:0%
look at the AMC the United States
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey group
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
um obviously the Appalachian Mountain
 
04:37:53.209 --> 04:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
Club they all rely upon the board of
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
geographical names so that they're able
 
04:37:58.090 --> 04:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
to align their their their mapping
 
04:38:01.250 --> 04:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
information so
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
even though to this day it's enacted as
 
04:38:05.570 --> 04:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
Mount Reagan federally it still
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
recognize this Mount clay so I think the
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
approach that you're asking this
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
committee and the responses of the bill
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
to pursue I think is an appropriate
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
venue considering it was seven years
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
before that particular board addressed
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
the issue of changing uh clay to Reagan
 
04:38:22.670 --> 04:38:22.680 align:start position:0%

I've been in a position with similar
 
04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
funding as chair and vice chair it's my
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
04:42:16.090 --> 04:42:16.100 align:start position:0%
this appropriation
 
04:42:20.208 --> 04:42:20.218 align:start position:0%
has been in at least one in in four
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets prior to this and three
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
in another Capital at three the other
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
rail uh three times in the capital
 
04:42:28.980 --> 04:42:30.430 align:start position:0%
rail uh three times in the capital
budget

04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:42:34.090 --> 04:42:34.100 align:start position:0%
the gentleman behind me that represent
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
these Rail lines will give you a lot
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
what we have traditionally done in
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
public works is
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
we take this request in it's been common
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
in the past for this committee to retain
 
04:42:51.170 --> 04:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and then bring it back in during the
 
04:42:57.250 --> 04:42:57.260 align:start position:0%
capital budget process
 
04:43:01.128 --> 04:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
and incorporate it into there so it is
 
04:43:03.490 --> 04:43:03.500 align:start position:0%
it is my hope
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
that the committee would see clear to uh
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a couple notes that
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
this is on our this is on a freight line
 
04:43:16.368 --> 04:43:16.378 align:start position:0%
these are Freight Lines this has nothing
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
to do with passenger
 
04:43:22.010 --> 04:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
and for the newer members
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice to run uh passenger
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
service over these but there are
 
04:43:31.250 --> 04:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
standards that aren't even close to
 
04:43:33.128 --> 04:43:33.138 align:start position:0%
being met
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the tracks and the rails to permit
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm in I'm in the area that of the
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
of one of these freight lines and the
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
important and the important thing to
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
consider is
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
that every one of these
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
railroad cars that's carrying material
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
in and out especially with the aggregate
 
04:44:04.128 --> 04:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
operation keeps thousands of tractor
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
trailers off our road that that weigh a
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount and so we have we have
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
seen benefits in the past I'm sure these
 
04:44:15.050 --> 04:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
gentlemen will address that going
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
04:44:17.458 --> 04:44:18.050 align:start position:0%
forward and
um

04:44:18.050 --> 04:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
I I just hope you'll give them due
 
04:44:20.218 --> 04:44:23.930 align:start position:0%
I I just hope you'll give them due
consideration

04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.730 --> 04:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr representative McConkey
 
04:44:27.770 --> 04:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
does everybody have any questions for
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
04:44:43.930 --> 04:44:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.730 --> 04:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to represent today
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
is a one of those red letter days where
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
we recognize all our old past chairman
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the Public Works committee we had
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Graham here earlier and
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
we now have ex-representative his
 
04:45:06.730 --> 04:45:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.288 --> 04:45:09.298 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's Noob to me there we go it's uh good
 
04:45:15.128 --> 04:45:15.138 align:start position:0%
to be uh back in room 201
 
04:45:17.170 --> 04:45:17.180 align:start position:0%
3 I guess
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm on the other side of the wall but uh
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm here today to um
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of House Bill 199 and
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
following up on the uh chairman
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
mcconkey's comments uh
 
04:45:31.850 --> 04:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
hoping you retain this so it can be
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
considered in the capital budget process
 
04:45:35.090 --> 04:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
the reason we do this is that we can
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
fully vet
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
this issue so you can understand what
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
the projects are and be able to ask
 
04:45:42.600 --> 04:45:43.448 align:start position:0%
the projects are and be able to ask
questions

04:45:43.448 --> 04:45:43.458 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:45:47.208 --> 04:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
there are 603 Short Line railroads in
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
the country they all they all carry
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
Freight there's no passenger rails 603
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
is easy to remember
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh 28 of all Freight in the country runs
 
04:45:59.330 --> 04:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
by rail and of that about 20 is on the
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
short lines the short lines are like you
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
know the main class one railroads like
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
CSX Union Pacific Canadian national
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
Norfolk Southern Amtrak to name a few
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
those are like the main arteries of rail
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
but off of those are veins and
 
04:46:13.970 --> 04:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
capillaries and those are the short
 
04:46:16.010 --> 04:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
lines that actually bring it right to
 
04:46:17.890 --> 04:46:17.900 align:start position:0%
the customers
 
04:46:20.810 --> 04:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
environmentally and economically Freight
 
04:46:23.810 --> 04:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
rail is very efficient uh Freight rail
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
can move one ton of goods 470 miles on
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
one gallon of diesel fuel it's the
 
04:46:31.610 --> 04:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
safest mode of transporting Freight
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
because you take it's on the railroads
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's it goes through controlled
 
04:46:37.970 --> 04:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
Crossings gets it off the roads as a
 
04:46:40.850 --> 04:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
chairman of mentioned previously
 
04:46:43.128 --> 04:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
um by diverting millions of strucks off
 
04:46:45.170 --> 04:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
highways it also lets lessens the
 
04:46:47.090 --> 04:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
highway wear and tear not just safety
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
issues but the wear and tear on the
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
highways and that reduces state federal
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
and local Highway budgets
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
so the last four Capital budgets have
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
had some sort of in both democratic and
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
con and republican-controlled
 
04:47:04.330 --> 04:47:04.340 align:start position:0%
legislatures has had some form of
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure repair now we say
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we're not talking about
 
04:47:09.490 --> 04:47:09.500 align:start position:0%
cars or operating expenses we're talking
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
solely the tracks themselves
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the the tracks being the rails the
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
ties the ballasts the railroad bed and
 
04:47:19.250 --> 04:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
the state for its part
 
04:47:21.890 --> 04:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
maintains a 10-year lien on any loans
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
they give or loans or loans in the past
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
and sometimes these and these um these
 
04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
grants these 50 50 grants matched by the
 
04:47:32.090 --> 04:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
railroads the partnership between the
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
the rail and the state
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
maintains a a lien on the tracks and
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know so they they have
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
protection so if the railroad ever going
 
04:47:44.090 --> 04:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
out of business track reverts the state
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so the state has an
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
interest in keeping the infrastructure
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
up just as they spend money
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
and the on the roads highways Bridges
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
um and other forms of Transit like um
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
like the buses none none of the these
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
603 shortland railroads would exist
 
04:48:06.650 --> 04:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
except for the partnership with their
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
States and the federal government
 
04:48:11.208 --> 04:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
um I have a
 
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint here that I gave you and you
 
04:48:15.530 --> 04:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
know it's pretty self-explanatory but
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
I'll just go through the pages here
 
04:48:19.970 --> 04:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
quickly you know first it describes what
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
what we as nhn New Hampshire North Coast
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
do we run a 42 mile Short Line from
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford up to Ossipee used to be
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
part of the b m
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's 160 year old
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
Freight Line it's been there been
 
04:48:35.570 --> 04:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
running continuously for 160 years
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
um used to have a ski train that some
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
people remember in those parts that was
 
04:48:40.810 --> 04:48:40.820 align:start position:0%
just continued in the 60s
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
so the line was purchased in two
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
sections 86 and 93 by the Boston from
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Boston main railroad to Boston Santa
 
04:48:49.080 --> 04:48:50.090 align:start position:0%
the Boston main railroad to Boston Santa
gravel

04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
gravel
 
04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
who created the New Hampshire North
 
04:48:54.530 --> 04:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
Coast Railroad now the largest freight
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
commodity on this rail is concrete sand
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
manufactured up in Ossipee
 
04:48:59.878 --> 04:49:00.470 align:start position:0%
manufactured up in Ossipee
um

04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
better ICB Aggregates and our second
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
biggest is of propane we also do steel
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:12.650 --> 04:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
philosophy arrogance take sand they wash
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
it prepare for concrete sand
 
04:49:15.480 --> 04:49:16.190 align:start position:0%
it prepare for concrete sand
um

04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:19.550 --> 04:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
5200 of those cars
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
of of the freight of the 6150 are sand
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
related now about two-thirds of those go
 
04:49:28.010 --> 04:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
to Boston the other third goes to um
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
North Rochester for distribution right
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
there in the in the New Hampshire area
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
propane that all comes in that's propane
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
that comes into a tank farm that you'll
 
04:49:40.208 --> 04:49:40.218 align:start position:0%
see a picture of on the next page and uh
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
they've stored in the large tanks on the
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
property and then the individual trucks
 
04:49:47.948 --> 04:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
come out and they disperse that
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
they will they are hopeful to take even
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
more by that because it's cheaper and
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the cheaper they bring in the propane
 
04:49:56.448 --> 04:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
the less expensive it is for the
 
04:49:58.850 --> 04:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
homeowners on the other end
 
04:50:01.970 --> 04:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
um so the the statistics here are
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
showing you that the the present loads
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
right now at six six hundred fifteen
 
04:50:09.288 --> 04:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
thousand tons that's uh six thousand one
 
04:50:11.090 --> 04:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty hundred ton rail cars
 
04:50:12.890 --> 04:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
by the way the propane cars are just as
 
04:50:15.310 --> 04:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
heavy as the freight as the as the sand
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
all these cars are filled to the maximum
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's the only way it makes
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
it efficient so so whether it's rebar
 
04:50:27.010 --> 04:50:27.020 align:start position:0%
you know recycled oil they they run up
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
the freight to the maximum they can
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
which is 100 tons per car of freight
 
04:50:33.360 --> 04:50:35.390 align:start position:0%
which is 100 tons per car of freight
um

04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.400 --> 04:50:37.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a picture of that
 
04:50:42.050 --> 04:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
transloading facility uh in Rochester
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
you can see the large tanks you can see
 
04:50:46.970 --> 04:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
the trucks that that haul it off and uh
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the left hand side is the sand and
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
gravel translating facility that brings
 
04:50:54.410 --> 04:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
again con wash crayons concrete sand
 
04:50:57.050 --> 04:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
from up in Ossipee down to Rochester
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
which is about
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh 30 miles
 
04:51:04.490 --> 04:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh so this is this is the main advantage
 
04:51:06.770 --> 04:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
of rail Freight and why it's so
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
important you know it again it just kind
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
of summarizes what we talked about
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
but our current Freight volumes
 
04:51:15.410 --> 04:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
eliminate 40 000 heavy trailer trucks or
 
04:51:15.420 --> 04:51:16.730 align:start position:0%
eliminate 40 000 heavy trailer trucks or
tankers

04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
tankers
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
per year from our highways 40 000 trips
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
per year are taken off the roads because
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
the railroad and and its current volumes
 
04:51:26.448 --> 04:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
over the past 37 years these nhn trains
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
have moved over 26 million tons of
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
freight and that's taken 1.6 million
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
heavy truck trips off the highways and
 
04:51:33.000 --> 04:51:34.670 align:start position:0%
heavy truck trips off the highways and
bridges

04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
04:51:37.128 --> 04:51:37.138 align:start position:0%
um next page maintaining nhn's track
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure has been a public private
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
partnership since 1980s
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
we partnered with businesses
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities state and federal
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
governments to maintain and rehabilitate
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
the tracks it's it's a hugely expensive
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
thing with hyperinflation it's been even
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
more so
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and it's a constant process 95 of the
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
rail and ties have been replaced since
 
04:51:59.400 --> 04:52:01.310 align:start position:0%
rail and ties have been replaced since
1986.

04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
1986.
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
um railroad ties used to have like 100
 
04:52:04.490 --> 04:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
Year lifespan they don't make them like
 
04:52:06.890 --> 04:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
that anymore and they used to be soaked
 
04:52:08.090 --> 04:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
in creosote and you can probably
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
remember them as a but not anymore they
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
they have a they have a life that's like
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
25 to 40 years so the ones that were put
 
04:52:16.970 --> 04:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
in back at the beginning when when the
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire North Coast started have
 
04:52:20.890 --> 04:52:20.900 align:start position:0%
to be have to be replaced
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire North Coast has 49 gray
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
Crossings in 41 public and private roads
 
04:52:27.770 --> 04:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
of which 35
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
are signalized at 71 we're actually
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
working on another one right now
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
um we've continuously upgraded our
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
Crossings and by the way the crossing
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
program for every Road in this country
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
is 603 short lines and the main lines
 
04:52:42.288 --> 04:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
that's all done through federal dollars
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's a federal Crossing program the
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
United States government spends a lot of
 
04:52:45.900 --> 04:52:47.448 align:start position:0%
United States government spends a lot of
money

04:52:47.448 --> 04:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
through the states it's a mystery
 
04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
through the states to the railroads to
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh to upgrade the crossings because that
 
04:52:55.970 --> 04:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
is where safety I mean that's where the
 
04:52:58.368 --> 04:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
the train and the public meet are at
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
Crossings so they have to make sure
 
04:53:01.368 --> 04:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
those are safe and the government has
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
spent money on that and all the all the
 
04:53:05.868 --> 04:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
railroads participate in that this is
 
04:53:07.250 --> 04:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
just a little summary on the next page
 
04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
showing the capital budget match
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the last uh three for
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire North Coast that we were
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
involved with uh 1.8 million in 2017 1.8
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
in 2019 500 000 in 2021 uh and again
 
04:53:24.770 --> 04:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's match money so it's 1.8 million
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
half 900 000 from the state 900 000 from
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
the from the
 
04:53:31.010 --> 04:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
from the state from the railroad and the
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
2021 is 500 000 and even though we've
 
04:53:36.050 --> 04:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
asked for more in the in the
 
04:53:38.810 --> 04:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
placeholding um legislation we'll be
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
looking for that same amount in the next
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget 500 000 250 from the state and
 
04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
250 from the railroad here's some many
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the projects at Canal Street
 
04:53:50.330 --> 04:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
signalization Acton Ridge Market Street
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
we had a tiger Grant next page meet a
 
04:53:55.368 --> 04:53:55.378 align:start position:0%
tiger Grant it's a Federal grant we were
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
given two million dollars
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2013 and the money breakdown
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
that was 1.4 came from the feds 450 000
 
04:54:04.850 --> 04:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
came from the railroad 150 from the
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:54:10.970 --> 04:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
so with that they did 9 000 ties and a
 
04:54:12.890 --> 04:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
linear mile of relay and two Crossings
 
04:54:12.900 --> 04:54:15.050 align:start position:0%
linear mile of relay and two Crossings
uh

04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money but it goes fast and
 
04:54:20.690 --> 04:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
just to look at it those 9 000 ties
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
represent I think less than
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
less than five percent of the of the
 
04:54:29.690 --> 04:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
tire Ties on the on the rail line uh we
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
also had a washout you can see the
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
washout how it just uh
 
04:54:37.550 --> 04:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
it it uh it washed out in like 2009 and
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
two and then we finally got the money to
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
fix it it was very expensive I was part
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
of this too and it's very important
 
04:54:44.810 --> 04:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
because even though it was north of of
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
Osby aggregate's operations in its
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
mainly it ended the connectivity between
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
the rail and going to Conway the state
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:54:54.890 --> 04:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh and Shelley Winters is here from the
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
from the Bureau of rail and Transit
 
04:54:58.128 --> 04:54:58.138 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire owns
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical Aggregates North to
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
Conway and that rail Corridor is being
 
04:55:05.690 --> 04:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
maintained as a corridor and it with
 
04:55:08.570 --> 04:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
that washout there's no Corridor a
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
quarter is like a chain is weakest link
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know would destroy the whole
 
04:55:14.448 --> 04:55:14.458 align:start position:0%
thing so that was repaired and you can
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
see some uh before and after pictures on
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
the next page
 
04:55:21.890 --> 04:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh finally just to give a
 
04:55:25.010 --> 04:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
some perspective of what we do is talks
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
about how many ties we have 247 84
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
linear miles of rail uh okay here is it
 
04:55:33.770 --> 04:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
hit the 13 500 ties that were installed
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
prior to 2018 that represented 5.5 of
 
04:55:38.930 --> 04:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
the total ties
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and unexpected things can happen
 
04:55:44.270 --> 04:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
which we had a washout in uh Somersworth
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
how that happened was the water
 
04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
department wanted to flush one of their
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
hydrants one time
 
04:55:50.930 --> 04:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
into the river into the river that runs
 
04:55:53.810 --> 04:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
through Somersworth and it instead of
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
running the water hose over the tracks
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
at night to empty it they'd put it on
 
04:56:00.288 --> 04:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
the other side of the tracks and the
 
04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
water came under the tracks eroded it
 
04:56:02.458 --> 04:56:03.770 align:start position:0%
water came under the tracks eroded it
fortunately

04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
04:56:05.090 --> 04:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
they were high railing in the morning
 
04:56:06.770 --> 04:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
they caught it but it washed the rails
 
04:56:08.930 --> 04:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
you could wash it out completely so that
 
04:56:11.208 --> 04:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
closed down the rail for five weeks and
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh we had and it was a major problem
 
04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so this Capital request this year is
 
04:56:21.410 --> 04:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
is again uh for 250 000 in state funds
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
we got a tiger Grant I mean sorry a
 
04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
Chrissy Grant granted uh two years ago
 
04:56:28.730 --> 04:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
still haven't seen any money or done any
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
work because the permitting is just uh
 
04:56:31.138 --> 04:56:33.110 align:start position:0%
work because the permitting is just uh
horrendous

04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
horrendous
 
04:56:33.120 --> 04:56:34.250 align:start position:0%
horrendous
um

04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
what we want to address with this money
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for is again more
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
bridges and more
 
04:56:43.610 --> 04:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
culverts the Chrissy grant that we got
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant is going to deal with
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem on the railroad as
 
04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
far as the bridge goes and that's in
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester it's the Haven Hill Bridge
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was built 160 years ago
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh 11 it's 11 feet high you know
 
04:56:58.730 --> 04:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
literally it was in the days of horse
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
and Buggies so that was not a problem
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
but today the trucks continually smash
 
04:57:06.770 --> 04:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
into the to the underpass
 
04:57:06.780 --> 04:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
into the to the underpass
um

04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:10.250 --> 04:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
since we got the tiger Grant in October
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
2020 it's happened three times and I
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
have one picture in here of that but we
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
have it well documented that you know it
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
just keeps it keeps happening and it
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
will keep happening but there was one
 
04:57:22.250 --> 04:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
time a garbage truck got stuck under
 
04:57:24.170 --> 04:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
there mostly lately it's been box trucks
 
04:57:25.850 --> 04:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
that turn into convertibles and you can
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
see you know they're carrying appliances
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
or whatever but one time a garbage truck
 
04:57:32.930 --> 04:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
got stuck and it dislodged the rail and
 
04:57:34.730 --> 04:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
shut down the rail for three three days
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
and fortunately again they on the before
 
04:57:38.570 --> 04:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
the train comes down each day somebody
 
04:57:40.490 --> 04:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
goes down on their truck High railing
 
04:57:42.650 --> 04:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
and they noticed that there was a
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
problem otherwise you'd have a
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
derailment and then you can have a real
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of not only property
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
damage but but life as well
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
um but the we have 32 other bridges that
 
04:57:53.690 --> 04:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
are all just as old and some of the
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
culverts just as old and we need to keep
 
04:57:58.490 --> 04:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
addressing those and this money is
 
04:58:00.050 --> 04:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
critically important to help that
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
process along uh here's some pictures on
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
the last couple Pages here page 12 you
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
see the photos of that bridge on the
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
right you see what happens to the truck
 
04:58:12.288 --> 04:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
once it goes through that bridge
 
04:58:12.298 --> 04:58:12.948 align:start position:0%
once it goes through that bridge
um

04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:15.850 --> 04:58:15.860 align:start position:0%
then you can see you know some of the
 
04:58:18.170 --> 04:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
abutments pedestals
 
04:58:19.610 --> 04:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
some of these Bridges how they need to
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
be repointed how the uh the seats
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
underneath them are not good and the
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
last page is really good because it
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
shows you there's there's 90 of these
 
04:58:31.550 --> 04:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
culverts on the property that are that
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
are Granite culverts and you can see
 
04:58:35.930 --> 04:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
they're just big old granite slabs that
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
were put under the railroad with with
 
04:58:39.288 --> 04:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
top pieces
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
and they've lasted a long time but
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
eventually the motion of the railroad
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
and time in water just kind of pushes
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
them along and eventually have to be
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
replaced and that involves a lot of
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
Permitting you have to go through the
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
not only nhdes but Army Corps of
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
Engineers and on the right you can see
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
when we did in 2018
 
04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
permits alone were 80 000 but it shows
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
you uh what the final product is and of
 
04:59:05.208 --> 04:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
course it's a lot safer
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
so that's our presentation I just wanted
 
04:59:09.530 --> 04:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
to uh be able to share that with you and
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
you have packets you can read in more
 
04:59:13.250 --> 04:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
detail I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
questions you may have today and if you
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
need to in the future
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Campbell is there any
 
04:59:21.650 --> 04:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has for
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Campbell
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:59:37.730 --> 04:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this is a private
 
04:59:40.690 --> 04:59:40.700 align:start position:0%
corporation that bought this railroad
 
04:59:43.610 --> 04:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
what kind of expectations did they have
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
when they bought this were they
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
expecting that New Hampshire would be
 
04:59:49.128 --> 04:59:49.138 align:start position:0%
subsidizing portions of their business
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
04:59:53.208 --> 04:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
actually the answer to that is yes I
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
mean it wasn't purchased without the
 
04:59:56.810 --> 04:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
knowledge at the time of getting not
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
only some grants but a large amount of
 
05:00:01.128 --> 05:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
loans that made it possible to refurbish
 
05:00:02.930 --> 05:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
the line when they when they got the
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
when they picked up that line it was in
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
very very poor condition uh
 
05:00:10.610 --> 05:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for it in the 80s but I
 
05:00:13.010 --> 05:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
was there in the 90s and the last 10
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
miles it turned into a five mile an hour
 
05:00:15.480 --> 05:00:17.170 align:start position:0%
miles it turned into a five mile an hour
track

05:00:17.170 --> 05:00:17.180 align:start position:0%
track
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
no business could make that work on its
 
05:00:22.128 --> 05:00:22.138 align:start position:0%
own without help from the federal
 
05:00:24.650 --> 05:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
government on The Crossings and the
 
05:00:25.730 --> 05:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire helped
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
significantly and we had we had loans
 
05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
that were paid off 20-year loans that
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
were paid off in the last four years uh
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
three of them and uh
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
and there was a grants as well I mean
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
the answer is absolutely the expectation
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
was not that this could work without the
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
partnership of the State of New
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some governmental funding
 
05:00:46.610 --> 05:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
or the railroad would just turn into a
 
05:00:50.330 --> 05:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
you know a bike trail follow-up
 
05:00:50.340 --> 05:00:51.770 align:start position:0%
you know a bike trail follow-up
so

05:00:51.770 --> 05:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
when I looked this up on the Internet
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
Boston sand and gravel owns this
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
and they seems like there's quite a few
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
companies in that orbit of Boston sand
 
05:01:05.330 --> 05:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
and gravel Manchester sand and gravel
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
the railroad Etc so
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
well what's the revenue estimate of
 
05:01:14.448 --> 05:01:14.458 align:start position:0%
those companies I I couldn't even tell
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
you I represent the railroad itself
 
05:01:18.770 --> 05:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
because I saw on here I mean I can't I
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
can't verify between 100 and 500 million
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to establish the you
 
05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
know the value with the people who own
 
05:01:26.040 --> 05:01:27.770 align:start position:0%
know the value with the people who own
this

05:01:27.770 --> 05:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:01:29.090 --> 05:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
well the company has a lot of Revenue
 
05:01:31.490 --> 05:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
but I know business right now is on a on
 
05:01:34.730 --> 05:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
a big downturn in the city I I each
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
company runs on its on its own a
 
05:01:39.890 --> 05:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
railroad has to run profitably or at
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
least near profitably in order to exist
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
like any other business and and I'm
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
telling you that the railroads in the
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
United States every one of them CSX
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is which by the way see just just
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know see b m became Springfield
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
terminal which became uh Pan Am is now
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
was purchased recently by CSX and CSX
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
they get federal funds they get Crissy
 
05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
grants they get State funds all these
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
railroads wouldn't exist just like
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
highways wouldn't exist without State
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
funding so I understand what you're
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying well they're a rich
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
company they don't need money well they
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
do because if the railroad doesn't carry
 
05:02:21.288 --> 05:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
its own weight the road can't make money
 
05:02:23.448 --> 05:02:23.458 align:start position:0%
or at least and and it believe me the
 
05:02:26.448 --> 05:02:26.458 align:start position:0%
railroad is right about here
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
and on years when you have
 
05:02:31.730 --> 05:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
washouts it loses money it's never made
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
significant money because if they have
 
05:02:35.330 --> 05:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
any kind of profit is poured back into
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
the into the maintenance and the
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
infrastructure again we're not talking
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
about engines and personnel and all
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
those things which are carried
 
05:02:45.410 --> 05:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
exclusively by the private concern we're
 
05:02:46.670 --> 05:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the infrastructure that's
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the ground on the state of New
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land and the state has a
 
05:02:51.288 --> 05:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
vested interest
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
and has at least policy wise believes
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
they would invested interest in
 
05:02:58.368 --> 05:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
maintaining that infrastructure
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
another follow-up
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
okay in 2013 you received the tiger
 
05:03:13.850 --> 05:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
grant for 1.4 million plus private
 
05:03:13.860 --> 05:03:14.868 align:start position:0%
grant for 1.4 million plus private
matching

05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
matching
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
and when I read that
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
that article on that it said that the
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
objective was to gain customer base
 
05:03:26.930 --> 05:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh to get gather more users for the line
 
05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
so when I look at it and I'm I don't
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
know if I'm wrong I'm seeing that
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
Boston's seeing the gravel is the main
 
05:03:35.930 --> 05:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
user transporting their own product in
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
Eastern Propane are there any more that
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
have been gained since 2013 10 years ago
 
05:03:42.890 --> 05:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
well there has been the waste oil
 
05:03:44.208 --> 05:03:44.218 align:start position:0%
company but that's actually in
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford at the very end other end of
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
the line
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
the uh that's a very good question but
 
05:03:52.490 --> 05:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
in the northern part in Ossipee by
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
fixing that washout they opened up
 
05:03:55.970 --> 05:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
hundreds of acres of land
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's now available that was not
 
05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
available before has anybody come up
 
05:04:01.850 --> 05:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
there yet not yet and part of the reason
 
05:04:01.860 --> 05:04:02.930 align:start position:0%
there yet not yet and part of the reason
was

05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:04:06.890 --> 05:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh we're the short line for a company to
 
05:04:09.890 --> 05:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
have a company uh and make money and
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
have real import first it has to be the
 
05:04:14.330 --> 05:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
right type of company secondly we're
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
just the tail at the end of the dog they
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
have to figure out what the rate is
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
going to be say from Shipping
 
05:04:23.570 --> 05:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
steel for instance from Pittsburgh to
 
05:04:25.930 --> 05:04:25.940 align:start position:0%
Ossipee they've got to figure up that
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
we've had people look at the land we've
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
had people think about putting other
 
05:04:32.330 --> 05:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
propane uh Farms up there
 
05:04:33.770 --> 05:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
nothing's happened
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
but the fact is because we did that
 
05:04:37.970 --> 05:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
tiger Grant it did open up hundreds of
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
acres of land that someday will be
 
05:04:43.090 --> 05:04:43.100 align:start position:0%
able to to hopefully support business
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
when Boston sand bought the line there
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
was a little industrial part in called
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
Knights industrial park in Rochester
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
and that was that became
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
what you see here this transloading
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
facility because there was a small piece
 
05:05:01.010 --> 05:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
of land there I'd say small it was
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
probably 40 acres it's we turned it into
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
a trans we bought it transloading
 
05:05:07.730 --> 05:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
facility and created a great customer
 
05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
not only for the railroad but for the
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
area because by bringing again propane
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
in by rail safer more economic passed on
 
05:05:18.350 --> 05:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the people who buy propane so we hope
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
for more we had it we had a different
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
propane company look at Ossipee they
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
looked at it for a long time they said
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
no but you know the fact that we did it
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
for a reason and hasn't come to fruition
 
05:05:27.420 --> 05:05:29.150 align:start position:0%
for a reason and hasn't come to fruition
yet

05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
yet
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I still believe that someday
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
especially with CX CSX as a partner I
 
05:05:35.330 --> 05:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
think we'll get more and more customers
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
on the railroad
 
05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:44.330 --> 05:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
wait till appropriate time it's fine I'm
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I said I'm glad to take them
 
05:05:47.280 --> 05:05:48.230 align:start position:0%
sorry I said I'm glad to take them
um

05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:51.288 --> 05:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
we'll go for one more in the uh in the
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line this is this is a
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
private company that owns this
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
and we as New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have contributed quite a bit
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
and in fact apparently Federal
 
05:06:11.580 --> 05:06:12.708 align:start position:0%
and in fact apparently Federal
so

05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
if if this line gets upgraded from class
 
05:06:20.448 --> 05:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
three tracks to class ones a
 
05:06:20.458 --> 05:06:21.350 align:start position:0%
three tracks to class ones a
um

05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
this company could still sell this and
 
05:06:25.730 --> 05:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not going to be in as a
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
um well the upgrades are important but
 
05:06:34.850 --> 05:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
but the classes designation won't change
 
05:06:36.170 --> 05:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
it'll just mean it would be a class
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
three railroad with
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
with a good infrastructure State of New
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again puts a 10-year lien on
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
starting from the date of any of their
 
05:06:47.580 --> 05:06:48.770 align:start position:0%
starting from the date of any of their
um

05:06:48.770 --> 05:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
contributions you know if they do a 50
 
05:06:52.490 --> 05:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
50 match they still put a 10 year old so
 
05:06:55.010 --> 05:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire still has their
 
05:06:57.050 --> 05:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
thumb on it if something ever went bad
 
05:07:00.410 --> 05:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
if if they went bankrupt state New
 
05:07:02.330 --> 05:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets the real
 
05:07:05.690 --> 05:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
so and as far as being a private concern
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right but so are the
 
05:07:12.288 --> 05:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
other 603 602 Shoreline railroads as are
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
all of the class one railroads which are
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
the big ones CSX Pan Am I mean up
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh Norfolk Southern
 
05:07:22.368 --> 05:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
community and National all of those are
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
with the exception of Amtrak which is
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
run by the federal government but all
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
the others are private
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Campbell
 
05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you Mr chairman
 
05:07:46.010 --> 05:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative Campbell thank you very
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony just a quick
 
05:07:49.610 --> 05:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
question because I was jotting down
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
notes how many miles per one gallon of
 
05:07:52.680 --> 05:07:54.470 align:start position:0%
notes how many miles per one gallon of
diesel

05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
diesel
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
this is from the Short Line correct
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
Association yeah it's 470 miles for one
 
05:08:02.448 --> 05:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
ton of freight
 
05:08:05.690 --> 05:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
um on one diesel one gallon of diesel
 
05:08:08.570 --> 05:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
fuel will move one ton of freight 470
 
05:08:08.580 --> 05:08:09.708 align:start position:0%
fuel will move one ton of freight 470
miles

05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
miles
 
05:08:09.718 --> 05:08:10.730 align:start position:0%
miles
okay

05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chairman
 
05:08:14.810 --> 05:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to the culverts and the
 
05:08:17.878 --> 05:08:18.830 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to the culverts and the
bridges

05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
which of the two is in utmost dire need
 
05:08:24.530 --> 05:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
of repair
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
well we we get both Bridge inspections
 
05:08:28.730 --> 05:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
and Culvert inspections so there's a
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
list there's a priority list of where to
 
05:08:33.410 --> 05:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
spend the money which can shift from a
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
year I mean year to year you you look at
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
the after the spring thaw there could be
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
a sinkhole in one of the culverts so we
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
have our own internal list that again is
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
kind of fluid in the sense that it
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
changes as as the priorities change and
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
obviously if you get a actual washout or
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of um you know Bridge settling
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh that would jump up on the list but
 
05:08:58.368 --> 05:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
the reason we don't get too far behind
 
05:08:59.930 --> 05:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
on it is because we have these annual
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
inspections uh
 
05:09:05.330 --> 05:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
for for the engineering Integrity as
 
05:09:07.368 --> 05:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
well as all you know daily inspections
 
05:09:10.128 --> 05:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
as far as the track Integrity goes
 
05:09:12.530 --> 05:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
final follow-up Mr chairman
 
05:09:16.010 --> 05:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
final follow-up thank you and along that
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
same line representative candle Campbell
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
does the acoe consult with you on those
 
05:09:23.448 --> 05:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
inspections and works with you on
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
specific design that will improve the
 
05:09:27.650 --> 05:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the Culvert of the bridge
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
we wish they did okay no but they they
 
05:09:31.850 --> 05:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
don't they only come they only come when
 
05:09:33.530 --> 05:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
when it's part of a permitting process
 
05:09:35.448 --> 05:09:35.458 align:start position:0%
Army Corps of Engineers okay yeah
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll get involved if there's
 
05:09:37.440 --> 05:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll get involved if there's
a

05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:09:41.690 --> 05:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
if there's a permit or emergency type
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know we had an emergency permit a
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
few years ago we had we had a near
 
05:09:46.610 --> 05:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
washout we had a club that was failing
 
05:09:48.650 --> 05:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
over Christmas and you know how it is to
 
05:09:49.610 --> 05:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
try to get things done over Christmas
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
with the US government but we actually
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
had the head of a New England ACO Army
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
Corps call up and he was an interim he
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
said I couldn't sleep last night
 
05:09:59.090 --> 05:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
thinking about what if there's a
 
05:10:02.090 --> 05:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
derailment on my watch under this on
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
this bridge so he expedited the permit
 
05:10:06.050 --> 05:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
and got it done and you know and we we
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
paid for that and at the time we didn't
 
05:10:10.250 --> 05:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
have any state funds but had we that's
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
where we'd spent some of those State
 
05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
funds thank you for answering my
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%

05:10:27.240 --> 05:10:30.250 align:start position:0%
excellent
pronunciation

05:10:30.250 --> 05:10:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
but I could have used them in the prior
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh well then my name on the prior Bill
 
05:10:37.970 --> 05:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
my name would be basavich
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
you pronounced the W's as v's and I've
 
05:10:43.128 --> 05:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
just learned that recently but Paul was
 
05:10:44.930 --> 05:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
switched from galago Callahan and got
 
05:10:47.330 --> 05:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
Trail I'm here today representing the St
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Atlantic Railroad
 
05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
been involved in
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
refurbishing of the Rails from the 90s
 
05:10:55.200 --> 05:10:56.090 align:start position:0%
refurbishing of the Rails from the 90s
and

05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
we started in back in 1990 the state
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
passed a statute
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
on rebuilding modernization and
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance of real properties
 
05:11:09.288 --> 05:11:09.298 align:start position:0%
at that time the state was
 
05:11:13.490 --> 05:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
the condemnation of rail was the only
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
way you could get and once it was down
 
05:11:17.930 --> 05:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
and out and state bought it then you
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
were eligible federal funds
 
05:11:22.490 --> 05:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
and the leadership in the house senate
 
05:11:24.530 --> 05:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
and the governor said why can't we save
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
the lines that are already existing
 
05:11:29.810 --> 05:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
and not wait till they be deteriorated
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
down to class zero and then we buy them
 
05:11:34.250 --> 05:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
then we got a refurbish from the
 
05:11:34.260 --> 05:11:35.270 align:start position:0%
then we got a refurbish from the
beginning

05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
05:11:37.010 --> 05:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
and by the way we're losing tax money
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
the railroads pay
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
we had a Statewide property tax back
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
over 100 years ago but money goes to
 
05:11:51.490 --> 05:11:51.500 align:start position:0%
every Community where the real goes
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
for a quarter of the revenue that we
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
bring in and Gene as former speaker
 
05:11:59.208 --> 05:11:59.218 align:start position:0%
Chandler and then Public Works chair
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
said he wanted to make sure where the
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
state-owned lines go they get some of
 
05:12:07.128 --> 05:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
that money so it's you know besides all
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
make it three hundred eighty thousand
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
um so the concept here was save the real
 
05:12:19.798 --> 05:12:21.170 align:start position:0%
um so the concept here was save the real
lines

05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
so we can attract companies now don't
 
05:12:26.448 --> 05:12:26.458 align:start position:0%
put them into
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
deterioration that they have banned they
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
are abandoned
 
05:12:34.208 --> 05:12:34.218 align:start position:0%
so there's a statute 228
 
05:12:37.490 --> 05:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
66 rebuilding modernization and
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance of real lines it requires if
 
05:12:43.448 --> 05:12:43.458 align:start position:0%
the railroads apply for this money
 
05:12:46.250 --> 05:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
they have to with this we've heard about
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
the liens but they're supposed to keep
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
it up to the to the the line if we bring
 
05:12:53.690 --> 05:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
it up to a class they call class two
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
you got to keep it that way and the
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
state really does a tough job on when if
 
05:12:59.628 --> 05:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
a grant comes through like this bill
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
would provide you know if we got 500 000
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the Saint Lawrence Atlantic and
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
match it with 500 000. we go through a
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
rigorous rigorous process and eventually
 
05:13:12.770 --> 05:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
goes to the governor Council but the
 
05:13:14.330 --> 05:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation does an
 
05:13:15.730 --> 05:13:15.740 align:start position:0%
excellent job and
 
05:13:19.128 --> 05:13:19.138 align:start position:0%
allocating the money and tracking it I
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
can tell you we had some track where we
 
05:13:24.890 --> 05:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
were cutting the the rail and we were
 
05:13:27.010 --> 05:13:27.020 align:start position:0%
off by
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
five feet they wanted to know what
 
05:13:31.850 --> 05:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
happened to that five feet we found it
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
but they know where every piece comes it
 
05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
was comes in and where it goes
 
05:13:40.730 --> 05:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
so that's the process that the state
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
follows today
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
and would fall to to get to that with
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the mind that we represent represent I
 
05:13:52.730 --> 05:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's they didn't have a Saint Lawrence
 
05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
Atlantic Seaway
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
200 years ago
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
so the line comes down this was the
 
05:14:04.490 --> 05:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
Saint Lawrence Atlantics Railroad and
 
05:14:06.288 --> 05:14:06.298 align:start position:0%
the line came down from the Montreal
 
05:14:08.868 --> 05:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
area end of Vermont but it was coming
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
remember we had the paper mills were
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
important to the to the North country
 
05:14:16.490 --> 05:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
and we would take products and bring it
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
all the way to Portsmouth to Portland
 
05:14:20.690 --> 05:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
and it would come down to Portsmouth
 
05:14:23.448 --> 05:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
because we got to some this area where
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
we had sea sea water that wasn't Frozen
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what we did
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why I wanted to see the map
 
05:14:37.010 --> 05:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
the map that you have before you the
 
05:14:37.020 --> 05:14:40.368 align:start position:0%
the map that you have before you the
line

05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
is we're running on some track that was
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.510 --> 05:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
they brought the prisoners German
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
prisoners to leave stock
 
05:14:55.610 --> 05:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
prison and walk camp
 
05:14:58.250 --> 05:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
so we have been gradually replacing them
 
05:15:00.650 --> 05:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
and then what's important in New
 
05:15:04.490 --> 05:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the land under our railroad
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
real line really tracks is owned by the
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
05:15:13.610 --> 05:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
and I found this out from representative
 
05:15:16.850 --> 05:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
Larry gay from Gorham they may remember
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
him but he called me over and said Sonny
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
you understand you don't own the land
 
05:15:23.930 --> 05:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
I took him for his word I went and told
 
05:15:28.610 --> 05:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
some Manchester lawyers and ah you don't
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about Cape get
 
05:15:30.770 --> 05:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
out of here
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
Larry brought me up to the archives we
 
05:15:34.610 --> 05:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
come back down
 
05:15:36.530 --> 05:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh you don't
 
05:15:39.410 --> 05:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
we only own we can operate a rail on the
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
land owned by the state of New Hampshire
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
and there is a deed of that you know the
 
05:15:46.368 --> 05:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has
 
05:15:50.330 --> 05:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
so when we took over the line
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
we've been gradually fixing it up and
 
05:15:55.128 --> 05:15:55.138 align:start position:0%
the second page I just wanted to show
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
you that we this product coming into New
 
05:16:00.410 --> 05:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that goes over that rail line
 
05:16:02.930 --> 05:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
but the real cars are only filled to 80
 
05:16:05.448 --> 05:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
capacity because of the track
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
so what we've been doing is upgrading it
 
05:16:10.368 --> 05:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
so we can get it full of load
 
05:16:13.730 --> 05:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing it working hard and
 
05:16:17.330 --> 05:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
getting there now this funding that
 
05:16:18.890 --> 05:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
we've been doing over you'll see the
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
history it really goes back to 2010
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
and a few years before then we've been
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
gradually working at it
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
we took you know give me two miles and
 
05:16:31.010 --> 05:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
we for funding to repair two miles we
 
05:16:32.208 --> 05:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
did it
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
it says keep moving forward
 
05:16:38.690 --> 05:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
so we're down to the last 10 miles but
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
we because of this approach that New
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was taking with the real
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation rail Bureau
 
05:16:48.890 --> 05:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
that we have applied for a Chrissy Grant
 
05:16:51.770 --> 05:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
and the people in Washington said you
 
05:16:53.690 --> 05:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
know we've never seen things like this
 
05:16:56.330 --> 05:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
we've got three states have applied all
 
05:16:58.850 --> 05:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
working together Maine
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Vermont
 
05:17:03.650 --> 05:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
so we made an application
 
05:17:07.128 --> 05:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
we hope we don't need this money
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
but if we do we will continue on we
 
05:17:12.650 --> 05:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
think we have a shot at it and the folks
 
05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
they were very impressed that we had
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
three states working together and three
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
people were investing money
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so and the state has been doing it and
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
again they were impressed with the
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
statute that we have on the books that
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
says would it keep maintenance of the
 
05:17:29.330 --> 05:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
rail line and the state has been
 
05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
actively involved
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so page three is really the Tri-State
 
05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
Regional upgrade project I've got other
 
05:17:40.250 --> 05:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
pitches but these trains come in leave
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
us leave this the rail on the side
 
05:17:45.890 --> 05:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
come along take out the old reel put the
 
05:17:49.010 --> 05:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
new rail on and you know it's very
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
impressive mechanism they go about three
 
05:17:54.170 --> 05:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
miles and I got some other photos that
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
are worthwhile looking at to see what
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
the real uh how it works it's hard to
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
believe but it's really uh it's just a
 
05:18:06.530 --> 05:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
assembly line on on the track
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
and then we again we have to maintain
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
the line You'll see on page four you'll
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
see some of the steel that's coming in
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and the breakdown of the work by
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
state but we hope to get a Chrissy Grant
 
05:18:22.010 --> 05:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
and it's recognizing that
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure our real
 
05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is needed and that this
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
that the government has the role to play
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
again we pay taxes
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
as I said we had a Statewide property
 
05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
tax before the education folks ever
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
thought of it and the reason we had a
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
Statewide property taxes
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
I mean we were trying to build a
 
05:18:45.050 --> 05:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
railroad in here in 1990 but then 1900s
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they didn't like it coming up
 
05:18:48.770 --> 05:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
across across the Massachusetts border
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
and it they attacked you real high
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
um and so they leveled it off and so it
 
05:18:58.430 --> 05:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
allows the state to continue and expl
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
with a rail system
 
05:19:04.610 --> 05:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
I let the last page is you know a brief
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
a history of what we've spent and how
 
05:19:10.250 --> 05:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
we've done it and we're proud of it
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
real proud of it we've added a lot to
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
the economy of State of New Hampshire
 
05:19:17.930 --> 05:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
and this system you know they made sure
 
05:19:21.050 --> 05:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
they're tough on us we're investing a
 
05:19:22.730 --> 05:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
dollar they make sure they get two
 
05:19:23.930 --> 05:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
dollars back
 
05:19:26.330 --> 05:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
and they do
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
so in a way well what we have done has
 
05:19:33.050 --> 05:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
helped save the real lines in the state
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
05:19:36.590 --> 05:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to continue that and
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
bring up you know try and attract more
 
05:19:41.208 --> 05:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
businesses that are interested in
 
05:19:42.530 --> 05:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
locating here but they want to know
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
transportation and rail is an important
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be glad to answer any
 
05:19:47.878 --> 05:19:50.570 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be glad to answer any
questions

05:19:50.570 --> 05:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
but that's that's again the we hope that
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
we get that Chrissy Grant but it's only
 
05:19:58.970 --> 05:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
because of the legislature passing a
 
05:20:00.890 --> 05:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
statute back in the 90s
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
gradually putting money into the rail
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they see it and the standards that
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've had to keep our real up to
 
05:20:09.650 --> 05:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll be glad to answer any
 
05:20:12.650 --> 05:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Orson for that
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
explanation I wasn't aware of that past
 
05:20:18.410 --> 05:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
legislation any questions
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
saying none you got off
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Boyd
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I appreciate it uh
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
Mr warsawitz thank you very much for
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding the railroad line operating
 
05:20:40.730 --> 05:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
on the land that's owned by the state of
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that an easement
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
agreement is it a lease agreement it was
 
05:20:48.650 --> 05:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
there a fee agreement it's for for usage
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any historical background
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the background was that the state wanted
 
05:20:56.208 --> 05:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
to keep the land
 
05:21:00.170 --> 05:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
then they allowed the railroad to invest
 
05:21:02.448 --> 05:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
money to put the track down
 
05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
but the land remained with the state of
 
05:21:06.288 --> 05:21:06.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:21:08.690 --> 05:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
and for them for some reason they left
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
the state probably inherited the rail
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
but they still inherited the land they
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
always wanted to own the land
 
05:21:20.448 --> 05:21:20.458 align:start position:0%
as representative gay told me we would
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
not going to let a
 
05:21:24.410 --> 05:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
another country
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
on our land in New Hampshire it's New
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%

Thomas Walsh
 
05:28:21.230 --> 05:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
Tom Walsh I'm a representative from
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 24 which is the towns
 
05:28:30.170 --> 05:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
of Hooksett and Dunbarton
 
05:28:32.330 --> 05:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 296
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to local
 
05:28:37.730 --> 05:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
Authority for granting driveway permits
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the easiest way for me to
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
describe this bill and what it seeks to
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
do is just tell you the the reason that
 
05:28:46.970 --> 05:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
I also serve on the planning board and
 
05:28:51.230 --> 05:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hooksett I have so have done so for 13
 
05:28:51.240 --> 05:28:52.430 align:start position:0%
Hooksett I have so have done so for 13
years

05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:28:52.440 --> 05:28:53.390 align:start position:0%
years
um

05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:55.628 --> 05:28:55.638 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
adopted or approved a major subdivision
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
and a couple of years later somebody
 
05:29:05.448 --> 05:29:05.458 align:start position:0%
bought it
 
05:29:07.850 --> 05:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
and followed our subdivision to the
 
05:29:09.708 --> 05:29:09.718 align:start position:0%
letter this is dealing with driveways
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
our current ordinance specifies 14-foot
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
driveways for driveways of that length
 
05:29:19.010 --> 05:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
um so he went and got a building loan
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
construction loan and everything is
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
budgeted including the driveway follow
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
the plans to the T
 
05:29:27.288 --> 05:29:27.298 align:start position:0%
and when it came and built and
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
constructed the 14-foot driveway this
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
one needed a des permit with two
 
05:29:32.760 --> 05:29:34.730 align:start position:0%
one needed a des permit with two
culverts

05:29:34.730 --> 05:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
culverts
 
05:29:37.970 --> 05:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and then my phone rings when it came
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
time for Co
 
05:29:43.970 --> 05:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
the certificate of occupancy the hooks
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
of fire department denied them their
 
05:29:47.930 --> 05:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy saying that
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
they wanted a 20-foot driveway
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
so again that's when I got involved so
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
doing some investigation and talking
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
with them I said where are you getting
 
05:29:59.090 --> 05:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
the information or the request for a
 
05:30:00.650 --> 05:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
20-foot driveway
 
05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
and what I was told by the the then
 
05:30:06.050 --> 05:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
safety now who was now chief that it's
 
05:30:09.650 --> 05:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
his interpretation of the nfpa-1 section
 
05:30:12.770 --> 05:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
18 that he's got the authority to
 
05:30:14.930 --> 05:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
determine that driveways of that length
 
05:30:18.410 --> 05:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
are actually fire safety access roads or
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
fire access roads
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
so if you read section 18 a fire Access
 
05:30:25.010 --> 05:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
Road actually talks about Gates knocks
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
boxes no parking signs and they're 20
 
05:30:30.530 --> 05:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
feet wide so the his interpretation and
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
it stands to this day is that because
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
he's the authority having jurisdiction
 
05:30:39.650 --> 05:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
in hooks it he can bring the fire code
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
fire access roads rules or some of them
 
05:30:46.368 --> 05:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
and impose his own width on driveways
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
planning board followed our ordinance we
 
05:30:52.368 --> 05:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
approved the drawing with 14 Footers the
 
05:30:55.850 --> 05:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
owner built it to 14 feet and then his
 
05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
Co was held hostage until obviously we
 
05:31:01.010 --> 05:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
got into it in a little bit of pressure
 
05:31:04.128 --> 05:31:04.138 align:start position:0%
was applied Etc I have tried to make
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
every effort to solve this in town I am
 
05:31:07.850 --> 05:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
not one of those Representatives that
 
05:31:09.230 --> 05:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
comes running here the first time
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
there's an issue but it has been very
 
05:31:15.890 --> 05:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
difficult to get anywhere with it
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
um so that's what happened to start it
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
since then my phone has lit up a couple
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
of more times for the same issue
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
um I guess he's decided he can live with
 
05:31:28.128 --> 05:31:28.138 align:start position:0%
16 feet rather than 20 but it's this for
 
05:31:29.930 --> 05:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
the same reasons he's still looking at a
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
fire Access Road rule in the code and
 
05:31:36.650 --> 05:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
our ordinance were never changed so this
 
05:31:38.990 --> 05:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
is just merely a
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
a an effort and this will go into the
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
chapter just below single family and two
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
family fire sprinklers as an exception
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
to NFPA to say that that the codes don't
 
05:31:52.250 --> 05:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
supersede what the local ordinance says
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of driveways and widths because
 
05:31:56.330 --> 05:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing we're looking at
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
right now is widths
 
05:32:00.770 --> 05:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing to stop the fire
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
department from getting involved in the
 
05:32:04.610 --> 05:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
process of ordinance changes they're
 
05:32:06.650 --> 05:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
actually their opinions uh weigh in
 
05:32:08.090 --> 05:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy and I'm sure they'd be
 
05:32:09.770 --> 05:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
successful and there is another
 
05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for fire departments uh if
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
this was adopted to chime in it's called
 
05:32:17.330 --> 05:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
a technical Review Committee which all
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
major subdivisions go through and it's
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to make exceptions
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I just I when I have constituents
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
basically crying on the phone to me
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
because they're out of money they can't
 
05:32:30.770 --> 05:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
get the CO for their new house and
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're running out of their lease on
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
their apartment something's got to be
 
05:32:36.288 --> 05:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
done I couldn't do it in town so I'm
 
05:32:41.448 --> 05:32:41.458 align:start position:0%
here now I have reached out to the dot
 
05:32:43.610 --> 05:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
to make sure because I'm hearing this
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
this language that I get from OLS after
 
05:32:48.410 --> 05:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
describing the situation might be a
 
05:32:51.288 --> 05:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
little broad but it's not my intent to
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
affect any dot curb cut widths or or
 
05:32:57.288 --> 05:32:57.298 align:start position:0%
issues on state roads because there are
 
05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
residential driveways obviously on state
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
roads too nor am I trying to get into
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
any commercial Endeavors so
 
05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with them about it I've also
 
05:33:11.410 --> 05:33:11.420 align:start position:0%
spoken with with Marshall Toomey
 
05:33:14.330 --> 05:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
and again I'm just really looking at
 
05:33:17.090 --> 05:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
single and two family residences so I
 
05:33:19.010 --> 05:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
hope to continue the discussions this
 
05:33:21.650 --> 05:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
week and I may have if you find issue
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
with this also an amendment to try to
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
narrow it down and and you know maybe
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns but that
 
05:33:32.208 --> 05:33:32.218 align:start position:0%
is in a nutshell that's what happened
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here and that's what I'm
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
trying to solve thank you Mr chairman
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:42.650 --> 05:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
questions of the representative
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
by committee yes represent Barger
 
05:33:48.288 --> 05:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:33:48.298 --> 05:33:51.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:33:51.470 --> 05:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
is it to understand that when the
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
planning board reviews a product or
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
development or whatnot it also goes to a
 
05:34:03.770 --> 05:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
technical Review Committee which the
 
05:34:07.368 --> 05:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
fire department is a standing portion of
 
05:34:10.250 --> 05:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
that committee and they provide reports
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
to the planning board saying they agree
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
with the documents that have been
 
05:34:15.420 --> 05:34:16.868 align:start position:0%
with the documents that have been
presented

05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh as far as design documents and stuff
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
that have been presented and they agree
 
05:34:25.970 --> 05:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
with that and therefore as I continue
 
05:34:29.208 --> 05:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
just almost finished that's right that
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
in this instance a 14-foot driveway
 
05:34:34.850 --> 05:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
would have been delineated on all the
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
drawings that the technical review board
 
05:34:41.570 --> 05:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
would have had an opportunity to review
 
05:34:42.530 --> 05:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative as I said this this
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision did go through a technical
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
Review Committee at the time and the
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
fire department does have a seat on that
 
05:34:51.360 --> 05:34:52.128 align:start position:0%
fire department does have a seat on that
board

05:34:52.128 --> 05:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh or in those meetings nothing was
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the TRC meeting everything
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
was fine no recommendations were made to
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
make any changes the driveways were in
 
05:35:03.770 --> 05:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
there at 14 feet which follows our
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance the planning would
 
05:35:09.110 --> 05:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
subsequently approved it and that's when
 
05:35:11.208 --> 05:35:11.218 align:start position:0%
this gentleman with his family bought it
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
built it to the plans
 
05:35:15.530 --> 05:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
at the time of certificate of occupancy
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
is when the fire department said they're
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
not accepting the 14-footer they want
 
05:35:19.920 --> 05:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
not accepting the 14-footer they want
20.

05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
20.
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would have been 10 literally tens
 
05:35:25.610 --> 05:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars with Des permits
 
05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
extended culverts not to mention the
 
05:35:30.530 --> 05:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
driveway itself that's basically why I'm
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:39.650 --> 05:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:35:42.170 --> 05:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh was was the
 
05:35:42.180 --> 05:35:43.550 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh was was the
ordinance

05:35:43.550 --> 05:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
05:35:46.730 --> 05:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
that the planning board utilized for 14
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
feet with ever vetted with the fire
 
05:35:48.600 --> 05:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
feet with ever vetted with the fire
chief

05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
chief
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's been thank you for the question
 
05:35:54.410 --> 05:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know but it's
 
05:35:55.850 --> 05:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
been on the books for as long as I've
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
been on the planning board I don't
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
believe there's ever been an issue if
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
again TRC is the opportunity for
 
05:36:02.690 --> 05:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
exceptional cases for the fire
 
05:36:04.250 --> 05:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
department to chime in if there's a
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
problem with a specific project
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
but they've been 14 feet for these
 
05:36:10.368 --> 05:36:10.378 align:start position:0%
lengths since I've been involved I can't
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
tell you when it was adopted never been
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
an issue before okay thank you very
 
05:36:17.868 --> 05:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.730 --> 05:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:36:21.770 --> 05:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
hearing my question
 
05:36:23.690 --> 05:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
um has this been an ongoing problem or
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
is this something fairly recent say
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
um the life safety codes of 2015 or
 
05:36:33.530 --> 05:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
adopted a few years ago is that what
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
kind of got things going here with thank
 
05:36:40.010 --> 05:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
you for the question no that's 15 8 and
 
05:36:42.650 --> 05:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
now we're in 18 which was just adopted
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
15 for sure 18 I believe is still the
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
case there is nothing in the codes that
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
refer to residential driveways as far as
 
05:36:50.160 --> 05:36:51.910 align:start position:0%
refer to residential driveways as far as
requirements

05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
this whole thing with the with what
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're attempting to do is using an
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what is in the code
 
05:37:00.288 --> 05:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
that deals with fire access roads which
 
05:37:02.330 --> 05:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
not my interpretation does that include
 
05:37:04.490 --> 05:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
driveway whatsoever and it's pretty
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
clear driveways don't have dropping
 
05:37:10.010 --> 05:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
Gates locked lock boxes and no parking
 
05:37:12.770 --> 05:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
signs generally speaking so
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
um it's it describe what issue has been
 
05:37:18.890 --> 05:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
new but other issues I guess without
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
going too far into it are not
 
05:37:24.770 --> 05:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:27.288 --> 05:37:27.298 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:37:29.690 --> 05:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question I
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear we're talking the
 
05:37:31.200 --> 05:37:33.410 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear we're talking the
width

05:37:33.410 --> 05:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
width
 
05:37:37.250 --> 05:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
so how wide is a fire truck
 
05:37:37.260 --> 05:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
so how wide is a fire truck
and

05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:42.050 --> 05:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better framed can a fire
 
05:37:46.368 --> 05:37:46.378 align:start position:0%
truck maneuver on a 14-foot with spam
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
well I you would know better to meet
 
05:37:50.448 --> 05:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
with the thank you for the question I
 
05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
believe a fire truck is not more than
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
eight feet wide because they do navigate
 
05:37:56.930 --> 05:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
on our city streets and and Roads and I
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact
 
05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
standard of of a lane but it's less than
 
05:38:05.930 --> 05:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
14 feet so to answer your question yes
 
05:38:09.770 --> 05:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is the
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
planning board in your town either
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed by the elected
 
05:38:17.100 --> 05:38:18.110 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed by the elected
officials

05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
in hooks that we are appointed thank you
 
05:38:21.770 --> 05:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:23.690 --> 05:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newton
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
 
05:38:26.400 --> 05:38:27.110 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
um

05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
so the it sounds like the problem
 
05:38:33.470 --> 05:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
started with uh or the issue
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the permitting the final permitting
 
05:38:37.850 --> 05:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
happened on this driveway that you're
 
05:38:41.208 --> 05:38:41.218 align:start position:0%
speaking of being 14 feet wide does that
 
05:38:43.850 --> 05:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
service one one residence
 
05:38:43.860 --> 05:38:47.750 align:start position:0%
service one one residence
yes

05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
05:38:53.570 --> 05:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing no further
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what preference you
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
gentlemen wish to go but I I would
 
05:39:02.040 --> 05:39:03.310 align:start position:0%
gentlemen wish to go but I I would
recognize

05:39:03.310 --> 05:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.320 --> 05:39:11.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:39:11.050 --> 05:39:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
05:39:32.570 --> 05:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Sean Toomey
 
05:39:34.550 --> 05:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the State Fire Marshal
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for allowing me a few
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
minutes to speak today I just want to
 
05:39:39.770 --> 05:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
note that I did have a few a couple
 
05:39:41.690 --> 05:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative Walsh
 
05:39:43.850 --> 05:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out a way to
 
05:39:46.250 --> 05:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
decide to solve this problem
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
um it sort of pains me to hear these
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
issues that come up and I don't think
 
05:39:53.090 --> 05:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
just a widespread statute change to
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
address some local issues is necessarily
 
05:40:02.208 --> 05:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do but I also uh
 
05:40:04.128 --> 05:40:04.138 align:start position:0%
need the I really want to work and
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
commit to helping Hooksett figure out
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
how to fix this because this shouldn't
 
05:40:09.770 --> 05:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
be the case that someone's building a
 
05:40:11.530 --> 05:40:11.540 align:start position:0%
residence or even a commercial building
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
and just about time for specific
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
democracy find out that they can't get
 
05:40:17.288 --> 05:40:17.298 align:start position:0%
there because of some
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
misapplication of the code or some
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I think that creates a
 
05:40:25.490 --> 05:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
lot of burden on the our people that are
 
05:40:28.270 --> 05:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
trying to build things in New Hampshire
 
05:40:31.368 --> 05:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
just to back up I as as written I do
 
05:40:34.850 --> 05:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill I share a letter with
 
05:40:36.530 --> 05:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
you I think representative Walsh
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
provided a really good
 
05:40:38.340 --> 05:40:38.990 align:start position:0%
provided a really good
um

05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
background of why and how we're here
 
05:40:43.970 --> 05:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
today and as I said we've talked a
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
couple times to try to figure out how to
 
05:40:46.730 --> 05:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
address the specific issue whether
 
05:40:49.368 --> 05:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
that's an amendment to this code or
 
05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me amendment to this bill or uh
 
05:40:54.770 --> 05:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
preferably I think for me would be to
 
05:40:57.288 --> 05:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
follow the state fire code process and
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to the board of Fire
 
05:41:00.890 --> 05:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
Control and then which would be ratified
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
by the legislative body within a year so
 
05:41:07.730 --> 05:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
we have the saf FML 300 rules which have
 
05:41:09.890 --> 05:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
a handful of amendments that are made
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
that are vetted by the members of the
 
05:41:14.410 --> 05:41:14.420 align:start position:0%
board of Fire Control with public input
 
05:41:17.390 --> 05:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
to address any specific concerns that
 
05:41:19.250 --> 05:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
come from the national quotes for New
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I think the
 
05:41:23.040 --> 05:41:23.628 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I think the
um

05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:26.690 --> 05:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
the issue around 20 foot width for a
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
driveway has been in the codes for more
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
than 20 years as best I can figure I
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
went back to the 2000 edition this
 
05:41:35.330 --> 05:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
morning just to double check and it had
 
05:41:38.090 --> 05:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
been there without really any change the
 
05:41:39.708 --> 05:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
challenge I think over the years has
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
been there's a little flexibility at the
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
local level to adjust that 20-foot
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
requirement and I think that became
 
05:41:49.788 --> 05:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
really becomes a problem at the end of
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
the day that you can't for a single
 
05:41:53.690 --> 05:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
family home or two family home for or
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
for a small commercial building for that
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
matter to bring it down to something
 
05:41:59.690 --> 05:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
less than 20 feet when we introduced the
 
05:42:02.690 --> 05:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
2018 codes and in this this body's heard
 
05:42:05.090 --> 05:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
the and helped to bring those forward
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
last year the 2018 codes allows gives
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
the ability at the local level to
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
clearly reduce the width to something
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
less than 20 feet and I think that it
 
05:42:18.050 --> 05:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
provided some great flexibility at the
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
local level it frankly I've been at the
 
05:42:23.270 --> 05:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal's Office for about
 
05:42:25.430 --> 05:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
five year just just about five years now
 
05:42:27.190 --> 05:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half is the Marshall
 
05:42:29.448 --> 05:42:29.458 align:start position:0%
and I will say that fire department
 
05:42:31.430 --> 05:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
access and water supply are probably one
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the bigger questions that we get for
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
technical questions from the locals and
 
05:42:37.670 --> 05:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
and since the 18 codes have come into
 
05:42:40.010 --> 05:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
play I think we've seen a decrease in
 
05:42:41.690 --> 05:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
those questions because the locals have
 
05:42:44.448 --> 05:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
the ability to decrease that that width
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
having done some research on the
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hooksett issue specifically I I walk
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
away with a scratch in my head a little
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
bit but the driveway application says 12
 
05:42:57.050 --> 05:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
feet the
 
05:42:59.208 --> 05:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
um the planning raises we heard are 14
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
feet and then there's a one pager that
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
the fire department has it says 16 feet
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
but then talk somewhere somewhere else
 
05:43:10.010 --> 05:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
it says you can do 14 feet again so
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
anytime you have that couple
 
05:43:13.850 --> 05:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
documentations from the officials that
 
05:43:15.890 --> 05:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
have that much confusion I don't know
 
05:43:17.090 --> 05:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
what to do with I mean that's that's
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
terrible for someone trying to do some
 
05:43:21.410 --> 05:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
development so I think those the local
 
05:43:23.810 --> 05:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
stuff needs to get cleaned up
 
05:43:23.820 --> 05:43:24.590 align:start position:0%
stuff needs to get cleaned up
um

05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:28.010 --> 05:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I making a drastic change
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the fire coat or at the in the
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
statute here is is probably in my
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
opinion not the the most appropriate
 
05:43:36.170 --> 05:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
place but we definitely need to fix it I
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
think the fire department access issues
 
05:43:40.550 --> 05:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
need to be kept with the fire
 
05:43:42.530 --> 05:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
departments because they really know
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
about tactical and operational
 
05:43:44.040 --> 05:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
about tactical and operational
considerations

05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um when we're needing to access
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
someone's property for uh whether it's
 
05:43:52.610 --> 05:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
life safety or property preservation it
 
05:43:54.170 --> 05:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
could be as simple as getting an
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance into somebody's house I've
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
been on numerous scenes I was out of
 
05:43:59.390 --> 05:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
fire just recently in the last couple
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
weeks that the fire truck couldn't make
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
it into someone's driveway and it slowed
 
05:44:07.250 --> 05:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
down the operations in the the house the
 
05:44:09.048 --> 05:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
second floor was in the roof where it
 
05:44:11.270 --> 05:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
was burned off that was in the Town of
 
05:44:11.280 --> 05:44:12.410 align:start position:0%
was burned off that was in the Town of
Warner

05:44:12.410 --> 05:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
Warner
 
05:44:12.420 --> 05:44:13.868 align:start position:0%
Warner
um

05:44:13.868 --> 05:44:13.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:18.890 --> 05:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
can I save 100 that that the lake was a
 
05:44:21.288 --> 05:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
huge break you know break the breaking
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
point I I guess I can't but I know I've
 
05:44:26.510 --> 05:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
watched Force hand because I live in the
 
05:44:28.368 --> 05:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
community and watch the delay it caused
 
05:44:29.868 --> 05:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
for the the fire department getting to
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
the building getting water on the fire
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think that
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I was kind of joking with the
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh we we got to figure
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
out a happy medium of we can't go back
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
to car paths or you know something very
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
small but we also I think you need to
 
05:44:48.048 --> 05:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
provide some firm uh guidance that maybe
 
05:44:49.850 --> 05:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
a 12-foot driveway for instance is a
 
05:44:51.890 --> 05:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
good minimum requirement for a uh for a
 
05:44:53.448 --> 05:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
single family home or one family home
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
where I personally live on a uh I drive
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
was a quarter mile long it's about 10 to
 
05:45:01.490 --> 05:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
12 feet wide on the gravel
 
05:45:01.500 --> 05:45:02.090 align:start position:0%
12 feet wide on the gravel
um

05:45:02.090 --> 05:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:04.730 --> 05:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
you know I know a fire department the
 
05:45:06.048 --> 05:45:06.058 align:start position:0%
truck can get down there I've had it
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
down there for my kids
 
05:45:11.208 --> 05:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
um you know years ago but uh
 
05:45:13.730 --> 05:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
you know so something much smaller we
 
05:45:16.128 --> 05:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
can't get the trucks in so I think that
 
05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know the one the one that'll
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
close with this the and I don't have the
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
exact language in front of me but nfpa1
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
and the question about whether it
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
applies to one in two families homes
 
05:45:27.890 --> 05:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
I've had conversations with the AG's
 
05:45:29.570 --> 05:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
office and there's certain Provisions
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
that clearly
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
um that do apply
 
05:45:35.810 --> 05:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
in this specific section in chapter 18
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about uh one of the
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions to a 20-foot driveway is a
 
05:45:41.810 --> 05:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
home that sprinkled
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that's I believe it's the exception
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
number one but I don't quote me I could
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
get it to if you if you really need to
 
05:45:46.558 --> 05:45:47.570 align:start position:0%
get it to if you if you really need to
but

05:45:47.570 --> 05:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
um as we know in in our state we've
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
Exempted the sprinklers for one two
 
05:45:52.610 --> 05:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
family home so
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
um the the NFPA one definitely applies
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
in specific cases to
 
05:46:01.610 --> 05:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
um to the residential structures I'll go
 
05:46:03.170 --> 05:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
back and just share one one other little
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
tidbit one in the 15 codes and now it's
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the 18 codes but we had a lot of
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
conversations several years ago about
 
05:46:11.090 --> 05:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
floor protection for the light weight
 
05:46:13.250 --> 05:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
construction homes now and how they burn
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
much faster and we amended the state
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
fire code the 401 and two family homes
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
to provide some protection of the floor
 
05:46:23.770 --> 05:46:23.780 align:start position:0%
structure so that it slows down the the
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
compromise to the system for instance if
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
there was a basement fire so there there
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
are definitely Provisions in the state
 
05:46:31.910 --> 05:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
fire code for one and two family homes
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
it's just our ability to regulate and
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
inspect and and deal with single-family
 
05:46:40.730 --> 05:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
homes is is very much different than
 
05:46:42.770 --> 05:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
commercial structure so I've been
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
answering questions
 
05:46:46.368 --> 05:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
um and I've provided sort of a summary
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
letter for you to review thank you sir
 
05:46:52.010 --> 05:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.770 --> 05:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
represent Boyd please
 
05:46:59.448 --> 05:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Marshall
 
05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
Toomey thank you very much for your
 
05:47:03.890 --> 05:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
testimony I took the opportunity to pull
 
05:47:06.170 --> 05:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
a section out of the state fire code for
 
05:47:09.310 --> 05:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
Dimensions which talks about
 
05:47:13.730 --> 05:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
182351 and then 18 23511 which talks
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
about access roads unobstructed with no
 
05:47:20.208 --> 05:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
less than 20 20 feet the section with
 
05:47:22.368 --> 05:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
with three ones at the end of it gives
 
05:47:25.970 --> 05:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the ahj The Authority
 
05:47:28.970 --> 05:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction to lessen that width
 
05:47:32.810 --> 05:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
at 20 feet and you testified that your
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
road is 12 feet I guess my question to
 
05:47:37.490 --> 05:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
you is in in your professional opinion
 
05:47:40.690 --> 05:47:40.700 align:start position:0%
do you think amending
 
05:47:44.570 --> 05:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
18235-111 in the fire code to say no
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
less than 12 feet may add Clarity to the
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
ahj in in identifying what that
 
05:47:53.990 --> 05:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility could be in terms of
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
determining the width of a residential
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
driveway I think that would be a pro
 
05:47:59.810 --> 05:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I think that would be a
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
great starting point to bring an
 
05:48:03.048 --> 05:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
amendment forward state of the board of
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
Fire Control with a 12-foot here at
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing from the fire officials
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
and some of the other contractors and
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
and try to provide some baseline some
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
guidance I appreciate your answer thank
 
05:48:13.970 --> 05:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd further question yes
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner thank you Mr chairman
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh could you clarify for me what how do
 
05:48:23.270 --> 05:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
you measure the unobstructed width is
 
05:48:25.368 --> 05:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
that the width of the pavement or is it
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
the width to posts or anything else on
 
05:48:30.288 --> 05:48:30.298 align:start position:0%
the side because it seems if you have 14
 
05:48:32.448 --> 05:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
feet of pavement
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
you have a three foot shoulder or
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
clearance on the side it doesn't have to
 
05:48:37.430 --> 05:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
be paved you don't have the impact on
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
the wetlands Etc but you still have
 
05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
clearance for the sides of the of the
 
05:48:42.120 --> 05:48:42.830 align:start position:0%
clearance for the sides of the of the
truck

05:48:42.830 --> 05:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
truck
 
05:48:45.230 --> 05:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
is there a way to measure a standard for
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
how we measure what the unobstructed
 
05:48:48.288 --> 05:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
with this thank you no I would say
 
05:48:49.970 --> 05:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
there's probably not the clearing the
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
clarity that should be in some of that
 
05:48:51.600 --> 05:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
clarity that should be in some of that
requirement

05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:48:55.070 --> 05:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the what I typically fall back when I
 
05:48:56.690 --> 05:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
provide guidance is it talks about being
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
able to Bear the weight of the apparatus
 
05:49:02.090 --> 05:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
so if you had a 12 foot paved driveway
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
and you were looking for a 14 or you
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
know if you would add some gravel
 
05:49:06.890 --> 05:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
shoulders and that might be appropriate
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
as we know many homes in New Hampshire
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
are just gravel driveways so
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
um mud season you just you want to make
 
05:49:16.970 --> 05:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
sure you have a a suitable surface that
 
05:49:19.610 --> 05:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
can hold the apparatus weight and uh I
 
05:49:21.770 --> 05:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
think the unobstructed really tends to
 
05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
be it wants to be a box of
 
05:49:27.708 --> 05:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
and if you took the extreme 20 foot wide
 
05:49:30.170 --> 05:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
by 13-6 so you can get the apparatus
 
05:49:32.208 --> 05:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
down the driveway so
 
05:49:35.330 --> 05:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
um but uh it's my opinion that you can
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
go a little smaller if you if you have
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
suitable shoulders
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
but it's not as clear as it probably
 
05:49:41.690 --> 05:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
could be
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:49:43.680 --> 05:49:47.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
yes

05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:50.030 --> 05:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative please
 
05:49:54.650 --> 05:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh is there any uh
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
delineation between
 
05:49:59.868 --> 05:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
uh like you said your driveway it was 90
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
feet long and then if you had a brand
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
new development that had houses
 
05:50:09.470 --> 05:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
multiple houses with the driveway of 15
 
05:50:12.048 --> 05:50:12.058 align:start position:0%
feet long
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
does that change the requirement of it
 
05:50:20.208 --> 05:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
as I say it I've never seen in a Housing
 
05:50:23.030 --> 05:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
Development where an ambulance or a fire
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
truck or anything where people had 15 20
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
foot driveways drove on the driveway
 
05:50:30.890 --> 05:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
because it would probably crack the
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
driveway and sink into it because
 
05:50:35.690 --> 05:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
they're not built to that standard I
 
05:50:39.470 --> 05:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
believe but I'm just curious is there a
 
05:50:39.480 --> 05:50:40.368 align:start position:0%
believe but I'm just curious is there a
difference

05:50:40.368 --> 05:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
between that 90 foot long driveway or in
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
a 15 foot long driveway
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
as far as length so thank you so the
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
question about length there there is
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
some guidance in there that typically
 
05:50:53.280 --> 05:50:54.530 align:start position:0%
some guidance in there that typically
within

05:50:54.530 --> 05:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
within
 
05:50:57.048 --> 05:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's 50 feet to double
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
check but I believe it's 50 feet from
 
05:51:01.250 --> 05:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
the from the fire department access
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
point to the door to get to is really
 
05:51:04.610 --> 05:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
what the some of the guidance is
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
typically so that
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and then there's some discussion in
 
05:51:10.610 --> 05:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
the code that if it's over a certain
 
05:51:13.128 --> 05:51:13.138 align:start position:0%
distance I believe it's 150 feet that
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
you need some sort of turnaround
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
typically to get
 
05:51:17.930 --> 05:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
um get yourself turned around back out
 
05:51:19.490 --> 05:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
and also you're not backing out of the
 
05:51:21.048 --> 05:51:21.058 align:start position:0%
driveway so that there definitely is
 
05:51:22.970 --> 05:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
some guidance I I don't have the numbers
 
05:51:24.890 --> 05:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
memorized but
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I can absolutely get that to you for
 
05:51:28.250 --> 05:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
sure if you would like it but there is
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
different Milestones based on the the
 
05:51:34.430 --> 05:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
distance to help get into the access
 
05:51:36.890 --> 05:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
one follow-up certainly
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
now would that make the difference
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
between something being called an access
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
road and a driveway is that that
 
05:51:46.490 --> 05:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
difference when you said something needs
 
05:51:48.410 --> 05:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
to be at the end for the turnaround and
 
05:51:48.420 --> 05:51:50.208 align:start position:0%
to be at the end for the turnaround and
stuff

05:51:50.208 --> 05:51:50.218 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:51:52.250 --> 05:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
so that the uh the fire department
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
Access Road discussion talks about like
 
05:51:56.330 --> 05:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
fire Lanes
 
05:51:59.690 --> 05:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
um roads uh had a couple words and then
 
05:52:01.730 --> 05:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
it says like any combination of thereof
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it's it's the fire department Access
 
05:52:07.270 --> 05:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
Road definition is pretty broad
 
05:52:09.770 --> 05:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
the the intent is for us to be able to
 
05:52:12.048 --> 05:52:12.058 align:start position:0%
get to you to provide uh whatever
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
Services we're there for whatever
 
05:52:15.948 --> 05:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services were there for
 
05:52:17.810 --> 05:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we
 
05:52:19.970 --> 05:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
we got to be able to get there to help
 
05:52:22.610 --> 05:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
you that's really what it is yeah
 
05:52:25.010 --> 05:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
so that definition is a little bit Broad
 
05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Melvin
 
05:52:29.510 --> 05:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:32.090 --> 05:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question how
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
would this affect uh a 2 000 foot
 
05:52:39.890 --> 05:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:43.250 --> 05:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
so I think the the private road would
 
05:52:46.128 --> 05:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
follow the same requirements under the
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the fire department access
 
05:52:48.120 --> 05:52:49.548 align:start position:0%
the uh the fire department access
Provisions

05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
05:52:49.558 --> 05:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
Provisions
um

05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:53.090 --> 05:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
it would start at 20 feet and then in a
 
05:52:54.770 --> 05:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
community they could talk about being a
 
05:52:56.570 --> 05:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
little bit less
 
05:52:59.030 --> 05:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the the initial
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
discussion around the 20-foot width is
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that two fire apparatus can pass each
 
05:53:04.730 --> 05:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
other if they need to so you're not you
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't get into a situation where you've
 
05:53:07.610 --> 05:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
locked up the driveway and you can't
 
05:53:09.048 --> 05:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
you're stuck you can't get anything in
 
05:53:10.250 --> 05:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
and out
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
um you know go to a go to a fire scene
 
05:53:15.708 --> 05:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
and you you put an ambulance and an
 
05:53:18.048 --> 05:53:18.058 align:start position:0%
engine in the in the in the driveway for
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
a very long driveway first you've got a
 
05:53:22.970 --> 05:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
patient a victim from a fire and now you
 
05:53:24.170 --> 05:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
potentially you're trapped in the
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
driveway it impedes our ability to help
 
05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
somebody you know I I don't want to be
 
05:53:28.860 --> 05:53:29.690 align:start position:0%
somebody you know I I don't want to be
like

05:53:29.690 --> 05:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
horrible extremists on their discussions
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
but that that's really in the code it
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
talks about the ability for two vehicles
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
to pass each other it's really it's
 
05:53:39.890 --> 05:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's what the commentary talks about
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
05:53:41.520 --> 05:53:42.288 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
you

05:53:42.288 --> 05:53:42.298 align:start position:0%

thank you any further questions by the
committee

05:53:47.090 --> 05:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:54.350 --> 05:53:54.360 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman uh my name is Dave
 
05:54:03.470 --> 05:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
Emmanuel I am the chief of the Durham
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
fire department and I'm here today
 
05:54:06.650 --> 05:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Fire
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Association and I just wanted to
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
state that we're opposed to the
 
05:54:12.288 --> 05:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
legislation is written but we're
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
interested in working with a sponsor
 
05:54:15.890 --> 05:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Welsh on amendments or
 
05:54:18.650 --> 05:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about the nature and our
 
05:54:21.048 --> 05:54:21.058 align:start position:0%
my experience in Durham we've had a
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
number of similar
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with driveway and fire
 
05:54:26.030 --> 05:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
department access and ours have
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
predominantly been on Legacy
 
05:54:29.750 --> 05:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that have been approved
 
05:54:31.730 --> 05:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
years ago but we still have the same
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
concerns for how we will get in and uh
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
to support the people
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes represent Boyd thank you Mr chairman
 
05:54:47.170 --> 05:54:47.180 align:start position:0%
and chief thank you for your testimony
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
basically the same question for that I
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
posed to Marshall Toomey
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
um ah Jade's up to 20. he's saying 12
 
05:54:57.650 --> 05:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
feet with work in your professional
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
opinion do you think a minimum of 12
 
05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
feet with with work based on you know
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
your experience
 
05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
I I like thank you for your question
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's never that easy
 
05:55:10.970 --> 05:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I understand that that's why I said
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
in your professional opinion
 
05:55:14.810 --> 05:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
the things that we concerned or are
 
05:55:17.690 --> 05:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
concerned often about the height width
 
05:55:20.090 --> 05:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
length and load bearing capacity of the
 
05:55:23.750 --> 05:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
driveway and we work locally since the
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
code changed or I got to know the State
 
05:55:27.530 --> 05:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal pretty well because we'd
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
had a number of these come forward over
 
05:55:31.190 --> 05:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
the past few years when we are allowed
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
to make accommodations locally we can
 
05:55:35.690 --> 05:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
work with the local boards to provide
 
05:55:37.850 --> 05:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
other accommodations like pull-offs so
 
05:55:40.368 --> 05:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
two apparatus can pass each other at
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
certain points along the way so we don't
 
05:55:45.890 --> 05:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
plug the driveway and we can pass or to
 
05:55:48.170 --> 05:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
put a turnaround at the end so I do
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
support we think we can support
 
05:55:52.970 --> 05:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
accommodations and 12 feet we I would
 
05:55:55.250 --> 05:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
agree in my opinion that's enough for a
 
05:55:56.810 --> 05:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
fire truck as long as you have other
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations in place for long
 
05:56:00.470 --> 05:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
driveways thank you for your answer
 
05:56:02.208 --> 05:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you Mr chairman
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and anyone else with further
 
05:56:04.440 --> 05:56:06.110 align:start position:0%
thank you and anyone else with further
question

05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
I have a question if I could and I'm not
 
05:56:11.390 --> 05:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
certain whether it should go to the fire
 
05:56:13.010 --> 05:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
marshal or whether it should go to you
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
so indulge me
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
the town planning board regulations say
 
05:56:23.448 --> 05:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
14 foot wide driveway
 
05:56:26.030 --> 05:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
this conversation is getting us back to
 
05:56:28.490 --> 05:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
12 feet I've developed enough property
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
knowing that 14 is probably a nice width
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's wider than a single Lane of most of
 
05:56:35.448 --> 05:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
your roads that go out into your
 
05:56:35.458 --> 05:56:36.948 align:start position:0%
your roads that go out into your
communities

05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:56:39.948 --> 05:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
so the the planning board has this
 
05:56:43.070 --> 05:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
regulation and I don't know which one of
 
05:56:46.610 --> 05:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen became involved later to
 
05:56:50.090 --> 05:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
to do the occupancy permit was that you
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
sir or you sir and the decision came
 
05:56:54.410 --> 05:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
down to
 
05:56:57.410 --> 05:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
that it had to now go to 20 feet I'm
 
05:56:59.868 --> 05:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
confused on that issue was it either of
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen yes sir
 
05:57:02.878 --> 05:57:04.730 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen yes sir
so

05:57:04.730 --> 05:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:06.470 --> 05:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'll give you the speaker button come on
 
05:57:08.208 --> 05:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
in Sean yep thank you thank you for
 
05:57:10.730 --> 05:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
coming forward welcome so the uh
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
the descript the scenario that
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh described was
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
specific to the town of Hooksett and the
 
05:57:18.350 --> 05:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hooksett fire chief okay um so it wasn't
 
05:57:20.090 --> 05:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
either of us
 
05:57:22.670 --> 05:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the guidance that I know I provided
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
at the state level as the State Fire
 
05:57:28.368 --> 05:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
Marshal was to be flexible and and not
 
05:57:31.010 --> 05:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
for a single family home not be not be
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
20 feet if 14 feet if your community
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
likes 14 feet pick 14 feet if you pick
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
16 feet Pick 6 16 feet my guidance is
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
pick something make it clear on what
 
05:57:43.610 --> 05:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
through your rule regulation however so
 
05:57:45.590 --> 05:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
people know what to expect when they
 
05:57:47.448 --> 05:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
come into your community so it's not a
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
guessing game okay thank you gentlemen
 
05:57:52.250 --> 05:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
for answering that question for me I I
 
05:57:53.990 --> 05:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
have nothing else at this time are there
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none from the committee thank you
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%

05:58:00.840 --> 05:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
both and thank you all three for your

testimony
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:38.040 --> 05:58:44.628 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
um okay so that that calls a conclusion
 
05:58:53.048 --> 05:58:53.058 align:start position:0%
to this hearing of uh House Bill
 
05:58:57.470 --> 05:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
296 we will not deliberate on this today
 
05:59:01.250 --> 05:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
um in hopes that the sponsor and might
 
05:59:02.990 --> 05:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
be able to come back with an amendment
 
05:59:04.670 --> 05:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
that might be favorable to all those
 
05:59:04.680 --> 05:59:06.170 align:start position:0%
that might be favorable to all those
here

05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:59:08.930 --> 05:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and do that as soon as you can so
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
with that I will call a close to uh
 
05:59:20.170 --> 05:59:20.180 align:start position:0%
