00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
it being two o'clock
 
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
I will call this
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
finance committee hearing to order
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
this is the public hearing for hb1 and
 
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.850 align:start position:0%
this is the public hearing for hb1 and
hb2

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for all the agencies in
 
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.210 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for all the agencies in
government

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
and we go through that page by Page and
 
00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
split it up amongst the divisions of the
 
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee we also have hb2 which
 
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 align:start position:0%
is another 200 pages that has that is
 
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
called enabling legislation because
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
since the
 
00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 align:start position:0%
hb1 is spreadsheets if there are
 
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 align:start position:0%
numerous changes to reorganize things if
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
the taxes increase decreased or changed
 
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
that would have to be an hb2 if there's
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
a reorganization of some Department
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
which affects their budget that would be
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
an hb2
 
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 align:start position:0%
there already has been a very voluminous
 
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the office of
 
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
professional licensure licensing and
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
certification we have received that and
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
passed it over to another committee on
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the house that's called executive
 
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
departments and administration they deal
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
with these licensing and all that sort
 
00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
of thing they have already had a lot of
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
input and I'm sure some of you will as
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
well and I'm waiting to find out I don't
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
think they're going to cancel all the
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
licenses that are mentioned in hb2 I've
 
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
asked someone to get me a report on what
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
licenses have really been removed I
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't see that remember here but I
 
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
expect we might have it
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
during our time here there it is
 
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
not ready yet but he's finding it out
 
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.349 align:start position:0%
not ready yet but he's finding it out
so

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
we're here to take your your
 
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
input to what the budget is before us
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
we've been working on it for a few weeks
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
and we have a couple more weeks to go
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
before we complete it we may decide to
 
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
change it if there's a lot of input from
 
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
all of you to things that are
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
distressing within the budget we will
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
try our best to accommodate everyone
 
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
however we started with a real a real
 
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.490 align:start position:0%
however we started with a real a real
challenge

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
the gov we had a input from the governor
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
and we began with that then we wait for
 
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
another Committee in the house called
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
ways and means that does all the revenue
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
estimates they gave us a revenue
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
estimate a couple of weeks after we got
 
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.629 align:start position:0%
estimate a couple of weeks after we got
the

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the budget from the governor and it was
 
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
85 million dollars less than the
 
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
governor supposed
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
so right away we had that challenge
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
we also have 52 bills that came through
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
this house chamber and were passed and
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
had a fiscal note on them then those
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
must come to the finance committee as
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
well so we're dealing with those bills
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
if possible we will retain the bill it's
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
specifically and try to incorporate it
 
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
in the budget if it spends a little
 
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.029 align:start position:0%
in the budget if it spends a little
money

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
so those are the challenges we have
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
before us we have some very busy days
 
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.330 align:start position:0%
before us we have some very busy days
ahead

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
we're delighted here's my committee to
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
listen to all of you and and your
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
concerns with this budget we definitely
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
want it to be something that we will be
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
proud of and feel that we have done
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
something to advance New Hampshire as
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
the wonderful State we all believe it to
 
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.129 align:start position:0%
the wonderful State we all believe it to
be

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.570 align:start position:0%
be
so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
since there's a lot of you that may have
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
the same issue
 
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 align:start position:0%
if possible if someone else has already
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
spoken about a topic that you are also
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
you can say I agree with a previous
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
speaker on such and such a topic I would
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
need not need I need not add anything
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
more or I would like to add one more
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
detail so you can take less time
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to Time Each speaker to
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
three minutes we always have a saying in
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
this house a three-minute speech is the
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
best speech because you can get your
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
points out there emphasize them get
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
enough of them in there I practiced it a
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
lot believe me and then be done so
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
three minutes will be timed for each
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
person that speaks you'll come to one of
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
those microphones make sure it's on
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
if you see a red light when you push the
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
button on the front then it should be
 
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.170 align:start position:0%
button on the front then it should be
working

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
working
so

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
we also are accommodating people who
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
will use American Sign Language they're
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
seated over here
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
one of the early requests I had was
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
someone that has to get back to his job
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
and he wants to speak on hb1 so I will
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
recognize Frank Campbell
 
00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members my name is
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
Ray Campo and I'm a sergeant with the
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
state police and I also serve as the
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
president of the Troopers Association I
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
am thankful for the opportunity to speak
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
today and would like to express some
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
reasons why it is important to fund the
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
wage increase for the State Police in
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
this coming budget
 
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
in the last five years we have received
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
a total of a 5.32 wage increase that
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
number Falls far behind inflation and
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
even further behind many of the local
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
police departments we are not even in
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
the top 15 highest paid agencies in the
 
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.249 align:start position:0%
the top 15 highest paid agencies in the
state

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Staffing crisis and the state police
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
is well known to put it in perspective
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
from 2015 through 2019 the state police
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
had 70 retirements and 12 resignations
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
in that five-year span that is
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
approximately 14 retirements per year
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
and approximately 0.41 resignations per
 
00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
and approximately 0.41 resignations per
year

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of 2020 through the
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
end of 2022 retirements and resignations
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
have skyrocketed retirements are up 42
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
percent and resignations are up 175
 
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
percent and resignations are up 175
percent

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it's worse the state police had a 20
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
something changed however
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
we are almost into the second quarter of
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
2023 and the state police has seen only
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
one retirement notice and one
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
resignation notice
 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
in addition we recently hired five new
 
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.730 align:start position:0%
in addition we recently hired five new
Troopers

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
Troopers
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
what caused this traumatic change
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2022 the treatment
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
Association of the state came through

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
the reference of this wage increase the
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
Troopers Bill valued and it is important
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
for them to not retire and a few more
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%

other police agencies in the state

I hope this perspective that I gave will
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
help all to understand the importance of
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
funding this wage increase and allowing

to me the board has been responsive to

adaptive license and will require
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
that board and after they gave a higher
 
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.930 align:start position:0%
that board and after they gave a higher
level

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
together on board and limited to just
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
one aspect from practice
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
all right we'll see if we'll see if you
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
have I have two cards for you I don't
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
know if I have a card for the second
 
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.370 align:start position:0%
know if I have a card for the second
person

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
so all right uh Dr Warner I'm going to
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
if we have time
 
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:11.350 align:start position:0%
if we have time
okay

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
we have another person that's going to
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
use the sign language interpreter
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
so we'll take that person up to the
 
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.610 align:start position:0%
so we'll take that person up to the
microphone

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.570 align:start position:0%

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
right away and so
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
there was not a lot of information
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:35.659 align:start position:0%
you actually can imagine
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
what the effort is to get his prefer to
 
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
all right I'm next going to call Joni

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
at this point it's very short-sighted or

at this point it's very short-sighted or

you can turn them in here at the front
 
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
table and all the members will get a

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
next we'll have Laura

cool leave
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she'll tell me how to pronounce

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
many Professionals in

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
revivals are extreme
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
but I think that merging some of those
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
Sports would actually be a very good way
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
of making them collaborate and
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
understand each other's policies and

in this services to our citizens
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
I also work directly
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
with that for many years and I do agree
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
with their point of view that is very
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.789 align:start position:0%

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
of society is much higher
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
than anybody else
 
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.769 align:start position:0%
than anybody else
so

00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
we could be doing a lot of food with
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
your acupuncture in this state if we
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
were set free and if people had freedom
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
to debate and provide the service that
 
00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:44.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
the power to make them make those
 
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:56.529 align:start position:0%
the power to make them make those
decisions

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:56.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
and it is constitutional thank you so
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on

[Music]

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to point out a few
 
00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:04.730 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to point out a few
things

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration any character should look
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
like and I'm looking forward to a few
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
things that I think are really important
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
so if you look at
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
chronic statistics for example we have
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
our the critical population of recent
 
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.870 align:start position:0%
our the critical population of recent
years

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
if you look at a current statute between
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
2014 and 2021 which is the most recent
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
Nation

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
at the same time you know around half
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
the people currently incarcerated in our
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
prison system right now are there for
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
parole violations and we think the
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
majority of those are for technical
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
violations so again most of those people
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
if we had more time since parole reform
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
would not be in the system and again we
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
would not need those people that space
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
available we also know that there are
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
significant number of people waiting in
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
our prisons because we have a lack of
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
community halfway houses and Community
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
Supervision and so but for the lack of
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we would again have a decrease in
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
our prison population so having this
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
conversation about setting aside 50
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars for construction without
 
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
looking at the long-term voter prison
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
system should or shouldn't look like we
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
think is troubling I also want to point
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
out some concerns we have on page 34.
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
starting on line seven which is with
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
regard to the quote northern border
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
Alliance program
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
and again this is setting aside about
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
1.4 million dollars to beef up policing
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
within 25 air miles of the Canadian
 
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.470 align:start position:0%
within 25 air miles of the Canadian
border

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
border
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
and I just want to give you some context
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
so when we had immigration checkpoints
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
for example up north
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
and this is not the ACLU speaking this
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
is a New Hampshire Court speaking
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
so while the court found in that case
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
around checkpoints because the
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
government was arguing that we needed
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
these checkpoints for immigration
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement the courts found quote that
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
while the stated purpose of the
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
checkpoints in this matter was screened
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
for immigration violations the primary
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
purpose of the action was detection and
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
seizure of drugs and so again I think we
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
have concerns that we're going to be
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
allocating all this revenue for
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
something that we know in fact is likely
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
going to be used to go after low-level
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
drug possession cases and so again one
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
point your time is expired thank you
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
Drew Klein is next followed by Mark
 
00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:54.769 align:start position:0%
Drew Klein is next followed by Mark
McMurphy

00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Drew Klein
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
president of the Josiah Bartlett Center
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
for Public Policy New Hampshire's free
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
market think tank we are here to speak
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
on the occupational licensing portion of
 
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.169 align:start position:0%
on the occupational licensing portion of
hb2

00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
when considering the occupational
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
licensing reforms and the governor's
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
proposed budget the first thing to
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
understand is that the separate pieces
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
fit together
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
into a comprehensive reform package
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
each one seems to stand alone but they
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
work together to achieve maximum benefit
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire residents and
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
consumers lawmakers should resist the
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
temptation to pick the package apart
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
transferring license licensing Authority
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
from the individual boards or the
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to the oplc
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
is crucial to making the licensing
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
process more efficient and reducing
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
industry capture of the licensing
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
process granting automatic license
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
Reciprocity for licenses held in other
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
states improves efficiency reduces
 
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:00.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory capture and increases
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
competitive market forces that benefit
 
00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.769 align:start position:0%
competitive market forces that benefit
consumers

00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
converting eight smaller boards to oplc
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
advisory boards improves efficiency
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
reduces regulatory capture and is a
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
better model for many boards than giving
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
the industry itself regulatory Authority
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
merging related boards also improve
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
sufficiency and reduces capture
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
and finally eliminating eight boards and
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
34 licenses is a huge pro-consumer
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
reform that eliminates needless
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory obstacles that limit
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
competition discourage professionals
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
from moving to New Hampshire
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
and impose unnecessary costs on numerous
 
00:32:39.179 --> 00:32:40.490 align:start position:0%
and impose unnecessary costs on numerous
Industries

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
Industries
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
these eliminations will not compromise
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
public health or safety
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
of the eliminated professional licenses
 
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:51.620 align:start position:0%
so that excludes the booths for Barbers
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the Peddlers Hawkers and itinerary
 
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
vendors just looking at the professional
 
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.389 align:start position:0%
vendors just looking at the professional
licenses

00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
all but one has a national
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority a national
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
certification Authority or some other
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
National Industry test or exam
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's only The Apprentice soil scientist
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
that I could not find a national test a
 
00:33:21.529 --> 00:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
regulatory body for and that's only
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
because the professionally soiled
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
scientist Society of America
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a separate Apprentice test
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
they have the test for everybody
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
so when you go down the list whether
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking at soil science Society
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
of America the cardiac credentialing
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
International the Society of American
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
Foresters the American Society of
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects you just go down
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
the list there's a National Society or
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
um governing body that provides a
 
00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
certification exam the one caveat to
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
that is athlete agent there's not like a
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
national athlete agent body but the
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
professional sports players
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
association's license or certify rather
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
and register their agents and insult na
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the NCAA
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
is doing the same thing for basketball
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
players so
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's no your time is inspired about
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
um public health or safety compromise
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
thank you next we'll hear from Mark
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Mark McMurphy I'm
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
the executive director of white birch
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
Center in Henniker New Hampshire we do
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
child care school age programming and
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
Senior programming and I'm here to
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
support the governor's budget hb1 for
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:48.260 align:start position:0%
and having a lot of business background
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
prior to going into this position 10
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
years ago and no child care background I
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
can share what I've learned and that is
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
not only is child care critical to Child
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Development critical to Working Families
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
but it's also critical to the economy
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
and that is the primary message that I
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
want to send today and I hope you
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
support it thank you thank you
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
Shannon Tremblay will is next followed
 
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.450 align:start position:0%
Shannon Tremblay will is next followed
by

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members I am here
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
in support of the governor's Department
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services budget as
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
it is proposed I'm here today wearing
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
two hats not only as a child care
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
provider but I also have a toddler and a
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
college age student we'll talk about
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
that later
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that we'll I'll be
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
spending just as much on child care as a
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
college tuition and parents don't have
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
the accessibility or the affordability
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
of child care
 
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.730 align:start position:0%
of child care
um

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
and the budget will allow more families
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
better access and for affordability to
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
check Early Childhood thank you
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Amanda Sears I'm the
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
director of the campaign for a
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
family-friendly economy here in New
 
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.730 align:start position:0%
family-friendly economy here in New
Hampshire

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:24.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
as the previous two speakers I am also
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
here in support of child care funding
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
for Working Families in the budget
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
you'll find that on starting on page 890
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
um we do need to support the funding
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is in there this is really
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
important for Working Families it allows
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
them to be able to have assistance to
 
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
pay for their child care bills and be
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
able to get out and join our Workforce
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
and participate in our Workforce since
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we have had a 10 decrease
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
in women in the New Hampshire Workforce
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
and this is largely a result of the lack
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
of access to child care I did a forum
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
recently I participated before in one
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
child care center in Manchester and they
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
had two classrooms that were empty
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough staff to
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
fill there to fill their Center so every
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
week they have 25 slots they can't fill
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
because of these empty classrooms and
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
when you multiply that across the state
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's a lot more spaces so in addition
 
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
to child care support for Working
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
Families I would implore the committee
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
to add into the budget funding for
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
Workforce supports for the child care
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
sector because we not only need some
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
distance for families we need more spots
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
in this state one place you can look for
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
a good model policy on how to do that to
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
add into hb2 would be Senate Bill 237 so
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to take a look at
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
that and increase not just support for
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
working families and scholarships for
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
assistance but also supports for our
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
Workforce our child care Workforce
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
because it's the workforce that supports
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
the whole rest of our Workforce thank
 
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.650 align:start position:0%
the whole rest of our Workforce thank

related proposals in hb1 and hb2 as you
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
know we have a severe housing crisis in
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state it's estimated that to meet
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
current needs were 23 000 units behind
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
to meet future needs over the next 30
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
Years where 60 000 units behind we have
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
record low Supply and we appreciate that
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal handed over to
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
the house includes many Key Programs
 
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:56.420 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to bring to your attention
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
the governor in hb1 has highlighted the
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund this is one of
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
the most important resources for
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
affordable housing development in our
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
state providing below market rate
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
Capital to developers so they'll build
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
more affordably and requiring
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
affordability periods that benefit the
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
residents the second one is the invest
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire program a new program that
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
was created with arpa dollars
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs also has a
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
lot of promise and we should sustain
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
those funding proposals that the
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed with surplus funds
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
in hb1
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
in addition the governor proposes a new
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit for historic
 
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
affordable housing this is a great idea
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
to convert our aged historic
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure into some useful
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
affordable homes for New Hampshire
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%

your attention homeless Services
 
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.060 align:start position:0%
as you know we have a homeless crisis
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
um the HP one is flat funded on homeless
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
Services we urge you to include the
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests from DHHS
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
that would be 20 million dollars to buy
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
more beds through homeless service
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%

Medicaid direct certification
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
automatically enrolls children already

receiving Medicaid and whose family
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
income qualifies them for free and
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
reduced meals without families needing
 
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
to submit a separate application
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
it reduces child food insecurity and

New Hampshire communities Medicaid
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
direct certification will make access to

a federal nutrition program more

seamless for those eligible
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
and and for the schools that implement
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
it it has the potential to ensure that
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
six to seven thousand more children have
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
the nutrition support they need to do
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
well in school and it ensures our
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
schools are getting every penny they
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%

Medicaid direct certification is more

accurate is a more accurate way to
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
measure children within schools who are
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
living with low incomes
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when USDA waivers
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
allow for all children to eat School
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
meals for free for free families did not
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
have the ability to apply for meals that
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
was for three years or did I'm sorry did
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
not did not apply for meals they did not
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
have to those waivers ended in October
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
but we believe there are still many
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
families who don't know that forms are
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
needed and as a result the free and
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
reduced meal counts are down
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
substantially in most districts and
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification would help
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
with that collecting forms is incredibly
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
burdensome for schools and for many
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
families who fall through the cracks it
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
misses them uh the Department of Health
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
and Human Service and Department of
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
Education have had an agreement for 16
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
years to share direct certification data
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
so that children on snap and TANF those
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
homeless migrant and Foster Care are
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Head Start can be directly
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
certified for free and reduced meals
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's never been a privacy issue in
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
fact Medicaid direct certification is a
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
much more secure way to convey data than
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
having children or families deliver
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
forms to school Medicaid direct
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
certification is a benefit to students
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
and a benefit to schools it's a win-win
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire we know how to do this

for this appropriation in the past this
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
allocation would ensure that the state

the funding crisis centers will be able
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
to provide core services including
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter the operation of our
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%

survivors find the courage to reach out
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
and ask for help it is critical that
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
crisis centers are able to respond with
 
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
with the services that they need and for
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
example in 2021 more than 82 000 calls

were made to our crisis hotlines
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%

intent of this provision to create

additional drf capacity we do have
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
significant concerns
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
the creation of new drf beds should be
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
done with careful consideration of
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
multiple factors including quality of

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is currently experiencing
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
a mental health Workforce shortage to
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
the point that New Hampshire hospital
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
has two units that are closed due to
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
lack of Staffing and at this time the
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
furthest North in the state that there
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
are any drf feds is Franklin which is
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
considering most of New Hampshire's
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
largest hospitals are on the Southern
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
Tier of the state as drafted House Bill
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
2 would likely perpetuate this unequal
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
access to inpatient psychiatric
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
resources felt by the North country
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
if these factors are not considered it
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
will result in an ineffective fragmented
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
approach rather than the successful
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
comprehensive system of care that
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
Granite stators need and deserve
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill contains a
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
provision that would amend the language
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
in RSA 135 c28 which currently requires
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
that person shall be immediately
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
transferred to a drf once the paperwork
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
for the iea is completed House Bill 2
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
removes the word immediately
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
which would result in further delay in
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
life-saving treatment for individuals
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing Mental Health crisis
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
it would make it legal for them to be
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
boarded indefinitely in an emergency
 
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:17.900 align:start position:0%
room receiving little to no treatment
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
therefore Nami New Hampshire opposes the
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
removal of the word immediately from the
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%

son my five-year-old Manny he loves

also Born Into the foster care system
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%

he's completely blind with no light

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
my husband and I were lucky to meet this
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
funny musical energetic imaginative and
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
curious child when he was just eight
 
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
months old
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
while he still has a loving relationship
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
with his biological mother we were
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to adopt him two years
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.210 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to adopt him two years
ago

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
we have learned over the past past five
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
years how vital access to support
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
services is for Manny and our family
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
we are profoundly appreciative of
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities he has access to and in
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
the in-home support we receive as we
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
could never do this alone
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
as Manny ages his needs increase
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
he must continue to learn how to
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
navigate the world without sight develop
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
Independence and thrive in a world that
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
is not designed to accommodate him
 
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
is not designed to accommodate him
easily

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
easily
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
in addition he has a sleep disorder as a
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
result of his lack of light perception
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
imagine how confusing it is for him to
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
not know when the Sun rises or sets each
 
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
not know when the Sun rises or sets each
day

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
also please imagine how exhausting it is
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
for Mom and Dad to only get a few hours
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
of sleep over a few days
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
the exhaustion has a ripple effect on
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
our professional lives as well as our
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
teenage son
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
loving Manny comes very easily
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
comes with many challenges
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
finding staff has been our greatest
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
challenge so far
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
my husband and I desperately need more
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
in-house home support to keep Manny safe
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
on the path to Independence
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
and to get a good night's sleep
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chairperson Wilder and the
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
members of the house finance committee
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
for considering testimony I urge you to
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
support a Medicaid rate increase for
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
developmental Services thank you
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Kristen Evans is next
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
come on ahead and I'll ask
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire to make an
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has information
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
about how many let's hear his
 
00:56:50.339 --> 00:56:52.730 align:start position:0%
about how many let's hear his
announcement

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
announcement
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
ready enough
 
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.270 align:start position:0%
ready enough
yes

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a very large section of
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that makes a lot of changes
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
to professional licensing and so we
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
handed all that to the executive
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
departments and administration committee
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
which deals with professional licensing
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
bills and they went over this and and
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
are making significant suggestions for
 
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:25.460 align:start position:0%
changes to first of all eliminations
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
changes to the law the language of House
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and they also have some of their
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
own bills that they can change in in
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
related ways
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
so in particular for those licenses
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
being eliminated in the house bill
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
2. there are
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
seven that they are recommending that we
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
do not eliminate and those are

Chloe Shred Shed and the pandemic has
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
made things really difficult
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
just can't find workers and the few work
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
workers that we do have we live in
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
constant fear that we could lose them
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
because the wages that these workers
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
earn are very very low and they have an
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of responsibility
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
Chloe also has a significant seizure
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
disorder we need people who are capable
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
for developmental services and funding
 
01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:32.299 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid waivers and a rate
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%

however I am not representing Nami New

with serious mental illness
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask that you ensure that the
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget you pass fully funds critically
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
needed Mental Health Services that are
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
accessible to all Granite Staters
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
my first loved one who is nearly 53
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
years old is a patient at Lakes Region
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%

acting
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
he has been an act patient since its
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
Inception in Laconia in July of 2013.
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
prior to that he spent his entire adult
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
life with repeated psychiatric
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations once for nearly a year
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2013 after two
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
back-to-back instances of dangerous
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
self-harm that resulted in multiple
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
surgeries and a stay at the burn unit at
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
Mass General Hospital we thought he
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
would have to move into a facility with
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
24 7 supervision which he absolutely did
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
not want
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
just as we reached that critical
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
decision point the state budget went
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
into effect and included in that budget
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
was funding for ACT teams to be
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
Statewide including Laconia they began
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
visiting him daily a sitting with daily
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living and helping
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
him stay healthy and not having a
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization since
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
my second loved one is now my now adult
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
child who was first diagnosed with an
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
emotional disorder at age five a serious
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
one by age eight and a serious mental
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
illness by the age of 14.
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult Journey but we were
 
01:04:46.619 --> 01:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult Journey but we were
lucky

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
my employer offered health insurance
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
that covered my child and he was able to
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
access the mental health treatment that
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
kept him at home in school and not in
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
emergency department or residential
 
01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.750 align:start position:0%
emergency department or residential
placement

01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
placement
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
as my child grew up there were many
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
sobering legalizations for me as his
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
mother that his path would likely be
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
different from that of other children
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
and that indeed he may not always be
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
able to work 40 hours a week all of us
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
is adult life
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
that he might not one day be able to
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
access treatment
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
that last one terrified me
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
my child had been a treatment success
 
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.970 align:start position:0%
my child had been a treatment success
story

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
despite some difficult times he never
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
required a visit to the emergency
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
department or a hospitalization
 
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
as my child approached his 26th birthday
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
he and I sat down to apply for Medicaid
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
expansion coverage for him a few weeks
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
later that letter erotic saying he was
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
covered and I wept
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
since becoming eligible for Medicaid
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
expansion my child has had periods when
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
he was been able to work and has his
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
health insurance and provided by his
 
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
employer or purchased it himself on the
 
01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
employer or purchased it himself on the
marketplace

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
when times have been harder he has been
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
able to access the mental health
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
treatment necessary for him to live a
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
full life your time is expired
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I urge you to fully fund
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
fully fund mental health treatment so
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
that people like my loved ones can
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
access the care they need I do have
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Bob Dunn the director of
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
Diocese of Manchester and I'm here today
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter obashi to
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill one
 
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.529 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill one
um

01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
and thank you by the way for all the
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
work that you have put into the budget
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
and that you're putting in today
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
just a couple of brief comments first of
 
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:53.900 align:start position:0%
all as a general matter
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
I urge you to please give a preeminent
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
priority in your decision making to the
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
poor and to those who are most in need
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
many of you have heard me say in other
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
contexts here this session that the
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
common good in human dignity are not
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
just religious principles but they're
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
principles that are at the heart of the
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
Constitutional order that was left us by
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
the framers starting with Article 1
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
Section one of the new part one article
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
one of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
which says that government has
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
instituted for the general good
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
I will um just speak to one aspect of
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
the budget in the interest of time and
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
that is the long-term care side of the
 
01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:46.789 align:start position:0%
that is the long-term care side of the
budget

01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
almost by definition the people that
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid nursing home care
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
are among the sickest and the neediest
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
of all of the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
and so they are also greatly at the
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
mercy of what Pope Francis likes to call
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
the throwaway culture which disposes of
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
things and people that no longer have
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and so as a result I would uh urge
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
you to fund adequately the entire
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
long-term care system and in particular
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh to adopt the 15 increase on nursing
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
home funding that was proposed by the
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Health Care Association in
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
front of division three
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%

01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Tom Blonsky I
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
am the CEO of Catholic Charities New
 
01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
am the CEO of Catholic Charities New
Hampshire

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have six facilities representing 390
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
beds and there are fully 50 beds that
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
are vacant because of acute staff and
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
short agents that we have
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
so our current scenario is that we
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
experience a loss of 75 per Medicaid
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
resident per day and our Medicaid census
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
in our various facilities range from
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 50 percent to 70 as high
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
as 75 up in our facility in Berlin
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
our current scenario with our agency
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
budget pre-covered was just under three
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars post covet in this
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
year's fiscal year budgets is 10 million
 
01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:43.130 align:start position:0%
year's fiscal year budgets is 10 million
dollars

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
this year in our fiscal budget we are
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
projecting 1.4 million dollar loss which
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine isn't sustainable
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
so historically Through The Years
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities has cared for several
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
State officials reps and Senators
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
including Federal Senators family
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
members who came to us because of our
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
reputation for quality care we have
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
three five-star facilities and one four
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
star facilities two three-star
 
01:10:08.699 --> 01:10:09.890 align:start position:0%
star facilities two three-star
facilities

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
and we're not interested in selling out
 
01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:15.140 align:start position:0%
to the many one and two star
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
out-of-state operators who bought up our
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
mom and pop nursing facilities or
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
smaller chains in the last couple of
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
years we don't want to get to the point
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
at that place financially where we have
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
no other choice but to sell because of
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
inadequate Medicaid funding
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
Never Say Never
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
if you were to need a nursing home bed
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
for yourself or a family member today
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or in the near future would you
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
want a facility that provides five-star
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
care or one star care
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
our seniors
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
who have gotten each of us to where we
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
are in part today deserve better quality
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the highest level of care in this
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
budget you have the ability to change
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
that and to sustain that for the future
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
I urge you to increase the Medicaid rate
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
for our state's nursing facilities by 15
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the new budget to save our nursing
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
homes and to save our seniors thank you
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Sandra Pelletier next followed

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill one and two in support of it
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
as well as Medicaid rate increase
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
the workforce crisis on top of the
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic has resulted in a perfect storm
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
due to Stepping shortages there's severe
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
lack of services programming treatment
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
and transportation for individuals that
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
we support daily
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
I can give you many examples in the last
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
three years have been pretty traumatic
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
for many of us who work in this field
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
with staff covering unfulfilled
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%

work of our staff our service

coordinators particularly our direct
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
support Workforce cannot be told there
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
is many many stories to share with you
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
and some of our families are here today
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
to personally share what this challenge
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
has been for them personally the burden
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
is truly falling on family members and
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
we see extensive level of crisis with
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
limited ability to respond I'll give you
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
some examples of unfulfilled efforts on
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
our behalf and the scope of work that we
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
provide Gateway serves close through 3
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
000 individuals and close to 2 000
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
moment as policy makers and realize this
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
could be your son your daughter your
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
grandchild your parent your grandparents
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
all need of these important services
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
over the last year I've watched our day
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
Services drop to 75 percent of their
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
capacity I've watched many of
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
individuals who need supported
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
employment who have been pretty excited
 
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
about the opportunity to work in their
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
adult lives lose their jobs because
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's no Transportation we'll tell you
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
last month in my board meeting during
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
the board meeting I started getting
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
calls because one of the national
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
Transportation Systems started to close
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
some of the service lines over the last
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
few months I had 20 individuals who had
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
long time employment opportunities
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
working at Dartmouth Hitchcock and other
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
centers who had no transportation in the
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
coming weeks fortunately a team of
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
people created some crisis response and
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
we were able to respond
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
I can go on and on and on our group
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
homes are working overtime at the
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
extensive level of overtime payment in
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
order to keep our 24 7 24 7 Staffing our
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
birth to three-year-old children are
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
being impacted daily Etc because of our
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
inability to hire occupational
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
therapists and physical therapists so
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
delayed services and evaluations are
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
occurring on the Elder side I've never
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
seen so many crisis I think some other
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
people have spoken to you about that
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
Elders in need of long-term care are
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
waiting to get into nursing homes we've
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
had many crisis we've watched
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
individuals have to stay long standing
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
in the hospital settings
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%

support part of the bill with Medicaid
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
waiver programs
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%

independently with quadriplegia for 21
years

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I worked and spent all my
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
financial resources in 2022 I needed to
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
go on Medicaid I was glad there was
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for employed adults with
 
01:15:39.179 --> 01:15:42.590 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for employed adults with
disabilities

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
this this me program allowed me to
 
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
continue to work because Medicaid is the
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
only insurance that will pay for
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
personal care attendance
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
under the Community Services
 
01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.209 align:start position:0%
under the Community Services

um
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
and this allowed me the personal care I
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
needed to continue to live independently
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
and to get in and out of my wheelchair
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
during this time and still now I work
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
with high school students to get as they
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
try to get their high school diploma I
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
work with newly injured spinal foot
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
injuries and other people with
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
disabilities encouraging them to get
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
their geds or take college classes apply
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
for employment and help them with health
 
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:32.060 align:start position:0%
and wellness activities
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
in addition I'm also a part-time Human
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
Service Department director for a child
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
welfare department at 65 I was told that
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
I needed to retire to get off disability
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
and get on retirement
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
and I was grateful that New Hampshire
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
passed mode Medicaid for older adults
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so I continue to live
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
at home and have personal care so I
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
could get up and still work as you know
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of older people have to continue
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
to work to support themselves
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to support the increase
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
in medical care Medicaid services to
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
close the lodge funding gap of
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities and older
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
adults so they could choose to live
 
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.430 align:start position:0%
adults so they could choose to live
independently

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
independently
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to enhance the funds that
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
will ensure rates across Medicaid waiver
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
programs these are programs as I just
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
exploded that are needed so people don't
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
have to go to nursing homes and increase
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of taking care of us
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
and we could live independently so
 
01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.470 align:start position:0%
and we could live independently so
please

01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
support the increase in funding for that
 
01:17:51.169 --> 01:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
and this budget funding is necessary to
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
keep people in our communities to be
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
productive contributing individuals
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%

the licensing of New Hampshire
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
professionals and to reduce the

administrative challenges to oplc
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
we recognize that oplc has and continues
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
to work hard to make the process as
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
not sufficient at this time to carry out
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%

Association I'm here on their behalf
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
we have been trying to wrap our brains
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
around this bill for the past two weeks
 
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
and we have very concerned of the
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
ramifications of the language and the
 
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:32.420 align:start position:0%
lack of information found in sections
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
289-301 in hb2
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
that would remove the board of
 
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
acupuncture licensing and replace it
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for standard applications that check all
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
the boxes we believe the executive
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
director could do work effectively could
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
do that work effectively and efficiently
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
however our concern starts when an
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
application does not check the standard
 
01:23:00.179 --> 01:23:01.910 align:start position:0%

qualifications

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
that are outlined by the law and the
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
executive director is tasked with
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
interpreting equivalency
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
hb2 minimizes that board that oversees
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
these decisions from two licensed
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists to two
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
sorry from four licensed acupunctures to

one treatment a protocol on the ear this
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially cutting the

expertise of this board in half
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice for acupuncturists
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
is vast and the majority of our
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners here in New Hampshire are
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
self-employed the licensing board has
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
been critical in overseeing that our
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
public is safe in the hands of every
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist licensed thus far
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
their effectiveness is shown in the very
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
few disciplinary concerns brought before
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
when balancing safety and efficiency
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
safety must take precedence
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
reducing the board's Collective
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge when interpreting equivalency

training and understanding the scope of
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
practice is reckless
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
it is not enough for two people to
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
represent the entirety of this medical

profession
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
going from four people to two gives each
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
person immense influence there is
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that outlines the
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
process of who is chosen and how are
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
they vetted
 
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
although we would hope that any licensed
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist would uphold standards of
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
the profession to ensure Public Safety
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the board is
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
representing the voice of acupuncturists
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%

01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%

it has been difficult if not impossible
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
to find home health care workers
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
a CFI Medicaid provider recently told me
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
that I'd have a better shot at winning
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
the lottery
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
than finding a new caregiver right now
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
I have been postponing surgery for a

for over a year
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
but it can be postponed no longer
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
I meet with the surgeon next month
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
what would you suggest I do
 
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:33.240 align:start position:0%

the CFI provider network is in danger of
 
01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
the CFI provider network is in danger of
collapse

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
collapse
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
these workers have not been giving given
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
a meaningful raise in over to 15 years
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
how much is the cost of food gas

electricity and home heating fuel
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
increased in 15 years
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
how can we possibly expect people to
 
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
work for fourteen dollars an hour with
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
no benefits in 2023.
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
a three percent or even a six percent
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
increase in wages is a drop in the
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
bucket especially with the availability
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
of easier higher paying jobs
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
is serving up burgers and fries or
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
stocking store shelves more important
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
than toileting dressing feeding and
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
caring for human beings made in the

image and likeness of God
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state is cutting off its nose
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
despite its face if it doesn't provide
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
the services necessary to keep our
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
adults with disabilities and our growing
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%

01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
I understand the plan is to put tens of

millions of dollars into the New

considering our home health care system
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
is in the midst of a violent tornado
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
this makes no sense to me
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
I urge you to do whatever it takes to
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
allow us to hire and retain retain

something we established during the
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
pandemic because we we just really
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any support for her and it
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
was one of her dreams was to start a
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
business so that's what we've done
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know workers in the direct support
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
field are very hard to come by these
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
days and they provide really vital and
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
incredible supports
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
and there's there's vendor agencies that
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
do surprise provide these supports but
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
we've they find it very hard to find um
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
to find and keep and attract support
 
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.790 align:start position:0%
to find and keep and attract support
workers

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
because it's you know a lot of people
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
just think it's easier to go to a basic
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
refund position it gets that that can
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
pay the same or more
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
so higher Medicaid rates would provide
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
this incentive for sport workers to stay
 
01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:24.260 align:start position:0%
in the field that they love
 
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
so again full funding for its support
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
for developmental services and Medicaid
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
rates higher Medicaid rates is something
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
we would help you support it's something
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know the uh this approach of Home
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
and community-based Services in New
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
over 30 years now it's worked and it's a
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
far less constant New Hampshire
 
01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:48.290 align:start position:0%

01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your for your support on
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
this um now we're going to go back and
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
do some more shrimping
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%

01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%

01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
although we work together with the

level
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the local level we have a board of
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
four surveyors and one public member
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
we need all those members in order to
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
conduct our work if we reduce that by
 
01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.110 align:start position:0%
conduct our work if we reduce that by
half

01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
half
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
the workload would remain the same and
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
taking on the addition of the engineers
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
board our workload would increase
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
between four to six times what it is
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:22.260 align:start position:0%

Landscape Architects however before
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
taking this opportunity to provide input
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
and feedback on the development of a

multi-disciplined licensing board
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
I want to address a previous statement
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the representative of the Bartlett
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Center for Public Policy to clarify
 
01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
there is no National governing body
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%

01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
the American Society of Landscape
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%

01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
professional association and does not

have any legal role in regulating the
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
profession regulation of the profession
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
is done through all state licensure in
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
our profession is not opposed to merging
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
and combining boards however if
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
regulated under a multi-disciplinary
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
board landscape architecture should be
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
regulated along with one of our more
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
Allied design professions architecture
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
or professional engineering
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
as landscape architectures regularly
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
work with these design professions it's
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
common to see Landscape Architects
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
regulated with them additionally these
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
technical design professions share the
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
foundation of Education experience and
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
examination as the basis for licensure
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
as well as excuse me incidental practice
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
overlap in fact three-fourths of the
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
states 38 in total jointly regulate
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
Architects and Landscape Architects
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
under one board the most recent state to
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
enact this joint structure was Idaho in
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
2022. it's also important to recognize
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
that currently no State Licensing boards
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
regulate landscape architecture with
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
natural scientists or Forester
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
lastly we recognize there is a national
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
Trend focusing on licensing efficiency
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
combining boards and restructuring
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
licensing departments when done
 
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
correctly a multi-disciplinary board can
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
be an efficient licensing entity
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
that is why it is common to regulate
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
professions with similar licensing
 
01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:08.179 align:start position:0%
structures and commonalities in practice
 
01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
therefore we highly encourage the
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee to regulate landscape
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
architecture with a related design
 
01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:17.060 align:start position:0%
professions allowing for an efficient
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary board benefiting
 
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
licensees and the citizens of New
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%

I come here today to address a reason
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the need for the rate increase for
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing and licensed RC
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%

children and adults in New Hampshire
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
we are in support of a 40 percent rate
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
increase for private duty nursing
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
and a 24 increase for lysine nursing
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
assistance which would take the rate
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
under a home health benefit from 2440 an
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%

ventilator dependent most of our clients
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
are born with this condition that caused
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
them to need medical care in our home
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their lives
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
the nursing shortage is not a new issue
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
since 1980 the year I was born
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
the average age of an RN has only
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
increased signaling that there's not
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
enough nurses are joining a profession
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
according to Health Resources and
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
services Administration
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
even on the population of this
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
population of private duty nursing makes
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
up one percent of Medicaid system census
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
typically the cost can be up to 40
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
percent of Medicaid spent
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
I want to want to repeat that one
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the population can cause up
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent of spend why is that
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
needless hospitalizations without the
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
nurses available these children wind up
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
in the hospital
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
I did some research and found that
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
your neighbor in Massachusetts
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is taking a lot of your
 
01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:13.850 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is taking a lot of your
nurses

01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
that means that 21 of the LPNs who live
 
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have Massachusetts
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
license and 31 percent of the RNs who
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire have Massachusetts
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
license they don't have those licenses
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
for no reason they're going there for
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
for a reason that's because of the pay
 
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
other states have increased their rates
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
Missouri by 40 last year Arizona by 10
 
01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:40.580 align:start position:0%
percent Virginia by 65 percent
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mississippi by 20 percent
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
I ask that you please join these states
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
increasing rates so we can staff these
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
cases appropriately and for these
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
reasons I decided I strongly urge you to
 
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
support the rate increase for private
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%

we're aware of the problem and I don't

01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
psychologists these written testimonies
 
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
highlight the specific difficulties of
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
dissolving the current board of
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
psychology and merging it with the board
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
of mental health practice
 
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:17.540 align:start position:0%
over 10 years ago the New Hampshire
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
legislature approved the formation of
 
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:22.820 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
separate separating it from the board of
 
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
mental health practice
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
after The Growing Pains of the first few
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
years this separate licensing board has
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
been working effectively for both
 
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
psychologists and the public
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
an HPA supports increasing
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
administrative efficiency and we are
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
actively working with the Ed and a
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee to continue to promote
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
effective and ethical improvements
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
regarding costs license fees essentially
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of operating board of
 
01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.470 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of operating board of
psychology

01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
consequently any cost savings for
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
merging the boards is minimal and will
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
not outweigh the cost to Public Safety
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
is also not a matter of elitism or some
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of turf war psychologists and other
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers are constantly
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
working together collaboratively in a
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
wide variety of settings
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
what does not work is when we attempt to
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
regulate each other's professional
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
practices they are just too different
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
that is why the independent board of
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
psychology was established over 10 years
 
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.370 align:start position:0%
psychology was established over 10 years
ago

01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
in fact in the United States only one
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
State Kansas has a Consolidated board
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
for regulating the practices of
 
01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.330 align:start position:0%
for regulating the practices of
psychology

01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
there are many very good reasons for
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
this governmental structure of one
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
licensing board for psychologists
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have already demonstrated the
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
Consolidated licensing board does not
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
what we currently have is working
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
we ask you to please help us keep this
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
current structure and allow us to keep
 
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
working with the Edna committee and the
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%

license court reporter number 166. I'm
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
here to speak on the potential repeal of

Licensing for court reporters

excuse me

what is also known as stenographers

everything that is said in illegal
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
proceeding and put it into a written
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
transcript attorneys fight for the
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
rights and Liberties of their clients
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
the litigants in order to gather
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
evidence for trial and effectively try
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
their case they call on license court
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
reporters to accurately take down
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
testimony at depositions and most
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
importantly protect that testimony court
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
report is not only right on our funny
 
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
little machines to take down the words
 
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
of everyone in the room but we ensure
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
that personally identifiable information
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
of those who testify is protected and

banking institutions and account numbers
 
01:54:36.609 --> 01:54:36.619 align:start position:0%
are very often testified to a deposition
 
01:54:39.169 --> 01:54:39.179 align:start position:0%
years and years of tax returns are at
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
our disposal as exhibits and don't even
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
get me started on what kind of
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
photographs we say we not only know
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
about someone's pii but we also know
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
private information too what medical
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%

Banky Jane to whom those funds go to you
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't prevent this information being
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
exposed to court reporters but you can't
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
prevent it from being disclosed to

it is up to the individual states to

require that certification as a Baseline
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then issue licenses per that State's

agree to abide by this code of ethics
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
which ensures that sensitive information
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
is not improperly disclosed if licensing

of court reporters is taken away there
 
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
is going to be zero oversight of who
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for taking testimony
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%

industry school districts
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
we are we're here today uh with regard
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
to line item 115 that section that would
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 281 colon a section 54 and
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
would abolish the second injury fund the
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
second injury fund was a fund that was
 
01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
set up for New Hampshire employers and
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
their insurance carriers and what it
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
does is it is a fund that is assessed to
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers and the employers
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
which they pay into each year with their
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
own money and then when they retain or
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
hire Injured Workers and those Injured
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
Workers suffer a second injury while in
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
their employee they can access that fund
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
and would get payment back for what
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
they've paid out in Indemnity benefits
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
as well as medical benefits why this
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
fund is so important is that not only
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
does it protect your New Hampshire
 
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
employers and encourage them it
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
encourages them to hire Injured Workers
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
or workers who have disabilities it also
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
protects the injured worker it's an
 
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
added layer of protection for them as
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
giving them the comfortability to know
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
that well maybe I injured my rotator
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
cuff and tore my rotator cuff and now
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
I'm back to work I don't have to work I
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry because if I get
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
injured again I know that my employer is
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to get reimbursed out of the
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
second injury fund and again the
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
important thing to understand here is
 
01:59:07.729 --> 01:59:07.739 align:start position:0%
that this fund is solely funded by the
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
employers and the insurance companies it
 
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
is their money and so there's really no
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
need for this fund to be abolished it is
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
encouraging lawyers
 
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.990 align:start position:0%
encouraging lawyers
to

01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
hire and maintain and retrain Injured
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Gary Harding followed by Joni
 
01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:34.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Gary Harding followed by Joni
Bernard

01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
Bernard
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Gary Hartford from
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
Bernard Merrill and I'm opposing House
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 only to the extent that you're
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
trying to Sunset or eliminate the second
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
entry fund the second industry fund was
 
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
created to
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
um encourage employers to hire people
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
and that's what it's there for there's
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
no taxpayer money involved in the second
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
entry funds there's uh like uh Michelle
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
said it's
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
employers it's the
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers money and what
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
happens when the employer gets
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursed from the fund is their
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
premiums will go down
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
so it helps businesses with lower
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
premiums so why get rid of a funds that
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
isn't broken
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's no need to eliminate
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
this I hear that the only reason why
 
02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:38.300 align:start position:0%
this is being introduced is because of
 
02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:39.910 align:start position:0%
this is being introduced is because of
cases

02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
denials of second injury fund there's
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
been an increase in denials and that's
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
only because the Department of Labor's
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
Administration has changed over so the
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
second injury fund coordinator is new
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're denying a lot more claims now
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
but what I've seen and I've been doing
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
this for 20 years now what I've seen
 
02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
this year the past two years there's
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
there's like between 15 and 20 claims
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
maybe for a cycle
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
ink that's it 15 to 20 claims that need
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
hearings so we average that out over a
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
year you're looking at one to two claims
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
per month so you're going to eliminate a
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar fund because of one
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
to two claims being processed per month
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense so
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
we we respectfully request that that's
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh that the funds just stay where it is
 
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.139 align:start position:0%
there's no need to eliminate the fund
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
Joni Menard or Tony Menard followed by
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.470 align:start position:0%
with us we're going to be speaking in
opposition

02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
to the request in hb2 to remove
 
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
licensure for our licensed nursing
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:02:29.089 --> 02:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
good afternoon in addition to opposing
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the removing the licensing of our
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants we also have
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
some concerns regarding the composition
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
of the members of the Board of Nursing
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
and reducing it from 11 to 5. so the
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing oversees over 50 000
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
licensees 12 000 of them are licensed
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants and approximately 1
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
000 of them are medication nursing
 
02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.470 align:start position:0%
000 of them are medication nursing
assistants

02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing has the following
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
concerns with hb2 if L A's were no
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
longer required to be licensed there
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
would be a decline in the quality of
 
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
patient care as well as a risk to
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
patient safety one of the requirements
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
to be a medication licensed nursing
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
assistant is to First be an l a

essential services to our long-term care

facilities and without this designation
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
of long-term care facilities we need to
 
02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
have higher level licensees providing
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
this task creating more of a burden for
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
are required to have more classroom and
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
clinical hours of training than a

2023 we emergently suspended nine lnas
 
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
due to concerns that they were opposed
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%

very critical checks and are vetted

of all LNA applications came before The
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%

in addition if L A's were no longer
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed they would not

lnas have been part of that program
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
since its Inception

cross-functional expertise and knowledge
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%

subject matter expert in certain
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
situations to better understand the

Dynamics processes and best practice in
 
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
those areas which again allows the board
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
to make more informed educated and
 
02:05:56.930 --> 02:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
timely decisions for those reasons we do
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
not support reducing the number of board

but I am also here representing uh
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism organizations as well

express support for the Governor's
 
02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
proposed marketing budget figure for
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal 2425. I also do have a letter
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
here signed from 26 organizations from
 
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
around the state that I will bring down
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
after I'm done speaking so uh but I also
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to like touch on a couple
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
bullet points and I'll be quick uh
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
tourism is a one billion dollar a year
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire that results
 
02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
in 55 million dollars in rooms and meals
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
tax which represents just over 10
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the state's general fund this
 
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
also helps support many of the important
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
programs that we've been hearing about
 
02:07:26.159 --> 02:07:27.709 align:start position:0%
programs that we've been hearing about
today

02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
I'll also note that the division of
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
Department of travel and tourism
 
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
division development has a
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
well-documented Roi of 16 for every one
 
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
dollar spent on promotion
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
a piece of this budget supports the
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
joint promotional program a matching
 
02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
grant program that many chambers and
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
tourism-related organizations use
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
including ski New Hampshire and it's
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
very important to how we operate
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
especially within marketing and
 
02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
especially within marketing and
promotion

02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the overall dollars that travel and
 
02:07:58.490 --> 02:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
tourism spends whether on their own
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
marketing campaigns or through
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
The Joint promotional program are really
 
02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
critical for the many areas of the state
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
that rely on tourism to support local
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
jobs Municipal budgets and more without
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
those funds we would be hard-pressed to
 
02:08:14.689 --> 02:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
do the work that draws visitors here it
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
helps local communities
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your continued support
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
of the travel and tourism industry and

02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%

Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we're neutral on hb2 as uh
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
as compiled but here to speak uh and uh
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
in full-hearted support of the
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal for uh licensing
 
02:08:59.209 --> 02:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
reform uh and uh reducing those barriers
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
to employment so these are common sense
 
02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
proposals in our mind it will streamline
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
regulations boards and eliminate
 
02:09:10.129 --> 02:09:10.139 align:start position:0%
unnecessary licensure requirements and
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal will also make
 
02:09:14.209 --> 02:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a beacon in the Northeast
 
02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
by taking the step to universally
 
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
recognized out-of-state qualified
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
licensed workers licensing recognition
 
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
recognition would reduce barriers uh to
 
02:09:26.209 --> 02:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
dozens of occupations between New
 
02:09:27.609 --> 02:09:27.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the rest of the country
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately making New Hampshire a leader
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
in removing Interstate licensing
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
barriers over 20 percent of New
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's sessions require a license
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
some form of occupational license to
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
work and many of these are low-income
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
entry-level jobs where individuals are
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
seeking a more prosperous life to move
 
02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
up the economic level these industries
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
and employers are struggling to hire
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
more workers so simply recognizing the
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
investment that they've already made in
 
02:09:59.169 --> 02:09:59.179 align:start position:0%
their home states to gain a license
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
in recognizing that work is a very
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward and easy way to boost
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy and still
 
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:09.659 align:start position:0%
protect the health and safety of its
 
02:10:09.659 --> 02:10:11.089 align:start position:0%
protect the health and safety of its
residents

02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
the governor also proposed eliminating
 
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
or streamlining 34 licenses many of
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
these such as Hawkers and Peddlers and
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
itinerary embed vendors the elimination
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
of those that uh have passed this this
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
house uh many times in the past few
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
years with very little opposition others
 
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
like nursing assistants are rarely
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
licensed in other states and puts a
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
massive barrier in the way of entering
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
the field just for for reference
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does not license uh
 
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants they require the
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
private certification that you can
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
attain so there's plenty of options
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
besides the heavy hand of licensure we
 
02:10:55.609 --> 02:10:55.619 align:start position:0%
commend the governor for identifying
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
many licenses that have very little to
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
do with protecting consumer safety which
 
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
is the intent of licensure and instead
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
these licenses erect barriers to lower
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
income individuals from climbing uh the
 
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
economic ladder and seeking a better
 
02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:11.750 align:start position:0%
economic ladder and seeking a better
life

02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
many of the arguments for keeping
 
02:11:15.850 --> 02:11:15.860 align:start position:0%
licenses like Landscape Architects
 
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
athletes agents Etc are based on federal
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
rules or insurance requirements for
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain jobs that can easily be replaced
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
by alternatives to licensure such as
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
private certifications or optional
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
government licensure
 
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh the current in the current economy we
 
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
think this is the absolute perfect time
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
to have a bold reform like this
 
02:11:41.089 --> 02:11:41.099 align:start position:0%
eliminate these barriers attract new
 
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
workers to our state and and provide
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
economic growth uh so for these reasons
 
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
we urge the committee uh to uh keep the
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
governor's licensure proposal and it's
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
an app in its entirety uh and give
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory relief to Granite Staters uh
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and provide this relief thank you
 
02:12:04.609 --> 02:12:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%

I have
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%

02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
um it might not surprise you to hear
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we're opposed to hb2
 
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and we submitted a testimony online
 
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to pull tease out
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
the the parts that um I want to want you
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
to hear today one reason that we are
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
opposed um to how we're addressed as
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
midwives in hb2
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
is removing our Council and moving it to
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board that's the way that it
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
affects us
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
um you know we've been a licensed
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
profession for over 40 years we've been
 
02:13:31.199 --> 02:13:32.830 align:start position:0%
profession for over 40 years we've been
self-regulated

02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
self-regulated
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
under the umbrella of oplc
 
02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
and there have been hundreds of hours
 
02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
that have been spent on these rules and
 
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
regulations and our statutes and how our
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
law gets played out to the New Hampshire
 
02:13:51.530 --> 02:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
public and it has been agreed
 
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
um on what
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
what it takes to administer safe
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
Midwifery care in this state and I
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
wonder what about the budget makes that
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
no longer valid that it would change the
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
way that our laws are being administered
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the vulnerable populations of
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and newborns
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to just say is
 
02:14:19.079 --> 02:14:19.970 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to just say is
um

02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
to the point of consultation as it
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
relates to the oplc executive director
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
which is an appointed position
 
02:14:30.079 --> 02:14:32.109 align:start position:0%
which is an appointed position
managing

02:14:32.109 --> 02:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
managing
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
midwives in the state under consultation
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
with the board
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
noting that there is no definition in
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
this bill for consultation
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
and there is no requirement for
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
consultation with the advisory Council
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
and um and that uh
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
again as another profession said that
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
outside experts are going to be brought
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
in and contracted to weigh in on matters
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
that our Council does as volunteers
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh there are other things that you'll
 
02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
read in the testimony that was submitted
 
02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
online but I'm going to yield to my
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues thank you thank you
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
who's next Kate or Sherry I'm Sherry
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
Stevens from Meredith New Hampshire and
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
I want to agree with what Rebecca said
 
02:15:26.689 --> 02:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to add that
 
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that they would take out
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the hb2 The Advisory making the New
 
02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Mid River Council and advisory
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
as opposed to keeping the council the
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
way it has been and it also would reduce
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
our Council from six people which
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
included three midwives a obstetrician a
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and a consumer member and
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
it would make it just one position
 
02:15:52.139 --> 02:15:53.530 align:start position:0%
it would make it just one position
either

02:15:53.530 --> 02:15:53.540 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:15:56.450 --> 02:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or obstetrician and we
 
02:15:58.609 --> 02:15:58.619 align:start position:0%
don't think they are the same and only
 
02:16:01.609 --> 02:16:01.619 align:start position:0%
have two midwives also I would ask that
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
you take out the part on 452 that
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
repeals the parts of our law because
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
we've worked really hard to make with
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
those three RSA 362 D in and I would
 
02:16:16.250 --> 02:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
really appreciate not repealing that not
 
02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
that I feel thank you and it's cater is
 
02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.930 align:start position:0%
that I feel thank you and it's cater is
next

02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Kate Hartwell I'm here as um
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
the board chair of the New Hampshire
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
Midway free Council I am going to Echo a
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of what my colleagues have
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
said but I'd like to outline for you the
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
concerns that the council has with hb2
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the Live Free or Die
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
State and few professions embody this
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
ideology better than New Hampshire
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
certified midwives to provide essential
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
background New Hampshire certified
 
02:16:53.089 --> 02:16:53.099 align:start position:0%
midwives are experts on natural vaginal
 
02:16:55.730 --> 02:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
delivery we serve the population of
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
low-risk mothers in New Hampshire who
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
choose to deliver either in their homes
 
02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
or increase standing State licensed
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
birth centers
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
under our scope of practice we can order
 
02:17:09.169 --> 02:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
all Labs ultrasounds and consults as
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
well as carry life-saving medications to
 
02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
assist in childbirth and postpartum care
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
we do this under the regulations and
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
standards currently in place and hb2
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
threatens every aspect of our profession
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
including Public Safety
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
for the past few years the Midwifery
 
02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
Council has welcomed administrative
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
assistance from the oplc we wish to
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
continue working with the oplc on the
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
administrative processes they already
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
help us with without losing the effect
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
of our professional expertise
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
hp2 proposes proposes to make the
 
02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council and advisory Council
 
02:17:46.129 --> 02:17:46.139 align:start position:0%
the Midwifery Council strongly opposes
 
02:17:48.169 --> 02:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
this for the following five reasons
 
02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
number one by Shifting the council to an
 
02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
advisory position hb2 effectively
 
02:17:55.730 --> 02:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
consolidates power into the executive
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
director of the oplc to Define
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%

including policies for professional
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
Direction and supervision
 
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
the executive director does not have the
 
02:18:15.049 --> 02:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
expertise to Define any of these areas
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
the council acknowledges that the bill
 
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
proposes the executive director would
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
create these definitions in consultation
 
02:18:23.089 --> 02:18:23.099 align:start position:0%
with the advisory Council under the law
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
however the executive director is not
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
required to consult or accept the
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
council's recommendations
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
this could hobble the profession
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
single-handedly point two the bill
 
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
proposes to reduce the number of council
 
02:18:38.089 --> 02:18:38.099 align:start position:0%
members from six to three currently the
 
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
council is made up of three New
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certified midwives one
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
obstetrician one pediatrician and one
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
public member
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes The Advisory Council
 
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
constitute one obstetrician or
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and two New Hampshire
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
certified midwives this eliminates the
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
broad representation of the profession
 
02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
and public serving on the council
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
and additional concern surrounding the
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
council's composition is the proposal
 
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
that the executive director selects
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
those members the executive director
 
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
does not have the expertise to select a
 
02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or obstetrician who has
 
02:19:12.349 --> 02:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient and relevant experience
 
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
working with midwives
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
I have to be very clear when I say many
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
Physicians do not understand our
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
practice at best or are actively
 
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
antagonistic at worst
 
02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
number three the council exists in large
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
part to protect the public during
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
meetings the council sees complaints
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
your time is expired okay thank you so
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%

02:19:45.709 --> 02:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
I think it could be stellato
 
02:19:45.719 --> 02:19:47.810 align:start position:0%
I think it could be stellato
from

02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%

unfortunately for the last almost three
 
02:21:19.969 --> 02:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
years we've been unable to have staff
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%

02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
hb1 increase the Medicaid rate so that
 
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.380 align:start position:0%

care of my daughter and when I do choose
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%

good afternoon thank you representative
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
Wilder my name is Debbie scary I'm the
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire College
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
University Council I'd like to thank you
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak before you
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to oppose the proposed
 
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
changes to the unique plan and the
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
establishment of a targeted Workforce
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
Development student debt relief program
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
hb2 proposes to make major changes to
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
the existing unique program the fees
 
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
generated to support the unique program
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
may vary from year to year based on
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
economic performance and that's why the
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
independent 529 commission which as
 
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
representatives from both the Senate and
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
the house that administers the program
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
developed both a scholarship fund as
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
well as a campus-based restricted
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund that assures through
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
good and bad Economic Times the money
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
will continue to be available to needy
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students and their
 
02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:02.570 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students and their
families

02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
100 of these funds are used right now
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
specifically for student scholarships
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
students will receive these scholarships
 
02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
are not required to pay them this is
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
pure age in New Hampshire's students and
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
families not loans these scholarships
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
May mean the difference between a
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
student heading to college or deciding
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
that he or she simply cannot afford the
 
02:24:25.859 --> 02:24:26.809 align:start position:0%
that he or she simply cannot afford the
expense

02:24:26.809 --> 02:24:26.819 align:start position:0%
expense
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
it is a tremendously successful program
 
02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
started in 1998 and to date has
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
dispersed 186 million dollars in
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship funds to needy New Hampshire
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
students over the years there has been
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support for The Unique
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and the legislature
 
02:24:49.370 --> 02:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
has consistently turned back efforts to
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
redirect These funds for other purposes
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we hope that continues in this
 
02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
while student debt assistant is an
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
important objective
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
and Workforce Development is important
 
02:25:04.969 --> 02:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
it should not come at the expense of New
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's student scholarship for
 
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
every million dollars taken from the
 
02:25:11.809 --> 02:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
existing program up to a thousand
 
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
scholarships to New Hampshire's students
 
02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
we have heard New Hampshire Business
 
02:25:20.809 --> 02:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
Leaders discuss the need for a
 
02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
well-educated Workforce and the vast
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
majority of high-paying jobs in our
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
state will require a degree
 
02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we are considering
 
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
taking funds away from the scholarship
 
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire students to earn a
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
college degree to and then pay for loans
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
makes it questionable policy
 
02:25:41.929 --> 02:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
this change would result in the loss of
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in student
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
scholarships for the most financially
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
vulnerable New Hampshire families
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
according to the National Association of
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
State grant and aid programs New
 
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:52.740 align:start position:0%

is that where we want to go
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
remember the medical technician who
 
02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
stole patients fentanyl filled their

02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
he also infected more than 40 people

UE he was unlicensed and unregulated
 
02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
CNAs certified nursing assistants have

opioids
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
the CNA has minimal accountability
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
nurses are allowed to delegate duties to

unlicensed personnel
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
but that unlicensed person faces no
 
02:28:49.849 --> 02:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
consequences if they do not follow the

02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and I also
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
asked leave of the chair to ask Lauren
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
Martin to also follow about gagne
 
02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:08.280 align:start position:0%

02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
say the name again Lauren Martin
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
I will look that up thank you thank you
 
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee members
 
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
my name is Jimmy Shaw I'm the chief
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
assessor for the town of Hudson I rise
 
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
in opposition to sections 303 through
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
306 on House Bill 2.
 
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
that is seeking to make the board of
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
certified assessors from an independent
 
02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
board to an Advisory Board
 
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
it also proposes to have the op oplc
 
02:30:37.849 --> 02:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
director being the one person
 
02:30:40.690 --> 02:30:40.700 align:start position:0%
responsible to appoint members to the
 
02:30:43.849 --> 02:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
oacb and it also eliminates the public
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
membership slot on the assessing
 
02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
certification board which I don't think
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
is well advised
 
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board was
 
02:30:53.929 --> 02:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
set up as an independent licensing board
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the house bill 1552 just in the last
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
session under the purview of the oplc
 
02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
that was just nine months ago both
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
bodies of the legislature agreed on the
 
02:31:06.889 --> 02:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
makeup of the independent board and the
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
governor signed the bill into law on
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
June 24 2022 many many hours were spent
 
02:31:15.610 --> 02:31:15.620 align:start position:0%
on this legislation in 22.
 
02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
involving all the stakeholders the
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board the oplc dra
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
the governor's office legislators the
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
general public
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
all of us had ample input into the
 
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
process and I'd hate to see that process
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
Jetsons under hb2 I would ask with The
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
Advisory board part to be stricken from
 
02:31:37.130 --> 02:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
hb2 I don't even really think it should
 
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
go to house Edna the work was already
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
Robert gagne and then you said Warren
 
02:31:53.690 --> 02:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
Chief assessor of the city of Manchester
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm here speaking today as a member
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the assessing Standards Board
 
02:32:01.610 --> 02:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that we have not met to
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
address this issue because it's come up
 
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
so quickly the assessing Standards Board
 
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
worked for months
 
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
to put together the proposal to create
 
02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
the assessing certification board under
 
02:32:14.770 --> 02:32:14.780 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
and and designed it to be an independent
 
02:32:17.399 --> 02:32:19.309 align:start position:0%
and and designed it to be an independent
board

02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
we were not consulted regarding changing
 
02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
changing it to an Advisory Board it may
 
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
not be the wrong thing to do but it was
 
02:32:28.969 --> 02:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
done without proper vetting we would ask
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
that this go to the Edna committee on to
 
02:32:34.490 --> 02:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
be properly vetted before it's adopted
 
02:32:36.530 --> 02:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:46.100 align:start position:0%
oh say the name again it's Lauren Martin
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
l-o-r-e-n that's what I was looking for
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.859 --> 02:32:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:57.469 --> 02:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
um I represent Avatar and I also am on
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board we worked
 
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
very diligently last year to form this
 
02:33:05.929 --> 02:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
new assessing certification board which
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
would take that board away from the
 
02:33:10.849 --> 02:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and put it under
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
the oplc a lot of work was done to to
 
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
that endeavor and then to just find this
 
02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
out that our board would be an Advisory
 
02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:21.070 align:start position:0%
out that our board would be an Advisory
Board

02:33:21.070 --> 02:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
Board
 
02:33:25.309 --> 02:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
is a little concerning to our profession
 
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's many things that went into this
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
and to think that assessors are now
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to be certified under just an
 
02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
Advisory board when our Duties are to
 
02:33:39.530 --> 02:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
Value property across the state and the
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%

02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:45.300 align:start position:0%

Echo what gem and Bob said and I won't
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
waste a lot of time and I do appreciate
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%

Healthcare Association we represent
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities including most
 
02:34:38.210 --> 02:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
of the state's nursing homes and the

Cedar Crest Center for children with

disabilities and for a break we're not
 
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
here to testify on hb2 we're actually
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
here to testify hb1 and we are
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully requesting a 15 Medicaid

funding increase for nursing home care

and for the Cedar Crest Center for
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities we agree with
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the CFI Advocates that our long-term
 
02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
care system is teetering right now and
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
when we look at the fact that we have
 
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
facilities in our state right now with
 
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
wait lists of over 100 prospective
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
residents we have the nation's fourth
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
worst nursing home Staffing shortage
 
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
according to arp we have a healthy
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
Reliance upon out-of-state staffing
 
02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
agencies a Reliance estate itself has
 
02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
experienced it's got a seven point six
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar contract with a
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
California agency
 
02:35:34.270 --> 02:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
to staff the New Hampshire veterans home
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
so all of these forces have combined
 
02:35:41.210 --> 02:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic began to make things
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
very challenging for us in the request
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we have in terms of funding is not
 
02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
out of line with what we have seen in
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
other states for example States like
 
02:35:50.939 --> 02:35:52.630 align:start position:0%
other states for example States like
Florida

02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
Nebraska Pennsylvania Wisconsin just
 
02:35:58.330 --> 02:35:58.340 align:start position:0%
over a one year period of time last year
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
raised grades by double digits as high
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
as 23 percent
 
02:36:05.929 --> 02:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
in the state of Wisconsin more than 17
 
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:08.180 align:start position:0%
percent in Nebraska and Pennsylvania
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
Governor DeSantis signed a budget which
 
02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
was over a 10 percent increase in just
 
02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
one year's period of time in the State
 
02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
of Florida and I think in terms of the
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
benefits of that if we look to the state
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and you heard testimony
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
earlier that a lot of our nurses are
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
double licensed here in New Hampshire
 
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
and also in Massachusetts and they go
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
across the border to opportunity in
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well Massachusetts has
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
raised Medicaid raids its investment in
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the nursing home Workforce by 33 since
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic began
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
their Staffing shortage is only
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
one-sixth of what New Hampshire's is
 
02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
right now we have over 60 percent of
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
facilities reporting shortages in
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is 10.9 percent so I have
 
02:36:53.090 --> 02:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
given you uh data on some of the
 
02:36:55.250 --> 02:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're facing when you
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
look at Stratford well you look at
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Nursing Home seeing a 2
 
02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
000 increase in staffing agency costs
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
just between 2019 and 21 going from
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
about 70 cents per per resident day
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
October 14 per resident day you can see
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we are on an unsustainable
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
trajectory and we need your help in
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
order to stabilize recruit retain our
 
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
own Workforce thank you Mr chairman
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is

Steve Allen president of New Hampshire
 
02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association I'm here
 
02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
representing all of our state's
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals development of the state
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
budget is a key exercise in addressing
 
02:37:57.530 --> 02:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
priorities in our state and we
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to share our
 
02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
thoughts with you you have our written
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
testimonies and we'll go through it and
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
detail but I do want to touch on a few
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
key points
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
first we appreciate the governors across
 
02:38:10.849 --> 02:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
the board Medicaid rate increases that
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
he's included in the budget but believe
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
we should be
 
02:38:15.889 --> 02:38:15.899 align:start position:0%
considering much more targeted rate
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
increases in the areas of Behavioral
 
02:38:19.309 --> 02:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
Health as well as for nursing home
 
02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
providers long-term services and
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
supports and Home Care Providers one of
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
the greatest challenges facing hospitals
 
02:38:27.050 --> 02:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
today is the inability to discharge
 
02:38:28.849 --> 02:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
patients who are medically cleared to
 
02:38:30.889 --> 02:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
move to their next level of care in a
 
02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
nursing home Skilled Nursing Facility or
 
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
home care but are unable to because of
 
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
their own Staffing challenges or the
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
inability to timely transfer patients
 
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
from our hospital emergency departments
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
who are in a psychiatric crisis higher
 
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rates would
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
create the stability and predictability
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
these providers need to be able to hire
 
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
and retain more staff to serve their
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
patients clients and residents
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
second the governor's budget proposes
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
significant reforms to our state's
 
02:38:58.849 --> 02:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
licensing functions these are important
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
issues but we believe we are concerned
 
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
that the proposed changes to remove the
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
licensure for certain Health Care
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
professions is too much too soon and a
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
more thoughtful coordinated approach
 
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
should be taken to understand the direct
 
02:39:12.889 --> 02:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
and unintended consequences of such
 
02:39:12.899 --> 02:39:14.030 align:start position:0%
and unintended consequences of such
changes

02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
third we do not support the delay and
 
02:39:17.570 --> 02:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
implementation of the workforce
 
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
workplace violence prevention and
 
02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
Healthcare workplace safety commission
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2. and finally
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
just three weeks ago a Federal District
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that the state here in New
 
02:39:30.050 --> 02:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is failing its responsibility
 
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
to care for our most vulnerable citizens
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
and must finally take action to come
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
into compliance and stop the practice of
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
boarding patients experiencing a
 
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis and hospital
 
02:39:41.809 --> 02:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
emergency departments in response the
 
02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
governor inserted language into the
 
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
Budget Trailer bill that enshrines
 
02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a broken system in place
 
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
state law is very clear and has been
 
02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
reinforced by multiple state and federal
 
02:39:54.050 --> 02:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
court rulings when a patient is deemed
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
to be a danger him or herself or others
 
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
and a petition for involuntary emergency
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
admission is completed the patient is to
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
be committed to the State Mental Health
 
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
System and is to be transferred
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
immediately to a designated receiving
 
02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:06.050 align:start position:0%
immediately to a designated receiving
facility

02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
the State closed two units at New
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital last year to do
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
staffing issues which resulted in
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating approximately 48 beds from
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the system exacerbating the crisis by
 
02:40:16.730 --> 02:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
further delaying care to patients in
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
need as of this February just a couple
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
of days ago more than 30 existing beds
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
remain unavailable to due to a lack of
 
02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
Staffing in New Hampshire hospital
 
02:40:28.250 --> 02:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals have been eager
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
to negotiate a short and long-term
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
binding solution with the state but
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
after multiple delays we were left with
 
02:40:35.210 --> 02:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
no alternative but to seek further
 
02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
relief through the courts to protect the
 
02:40:38.570 --> 02:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
rights of patients in hospitals these
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
latest developments with House Bill 2
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
are just not acceptable The Proposal
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
language particularly that which removes
 
02:40:45.889 --> 02:40:45.899 align:start position:0%
the requirement that patients be
 
02:40:47.570 --> 02:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
transferred immediately is just not
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
acceptable this these Persians are wrong
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
and they should not be included in House
 
02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
Bill too thank you very much for the
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share our thoughts be
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%

don't have good handwriting

uh for the record I'm Lindsay Courtney

I'm the executive director of the New

insurance certification
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
we've certainly heard a lot today a lot
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
of concerns regarding the governor's
 
02:42:08.030 --> 02:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
proposed licensing reforms and house
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2. but what we haven't heard is a
 
02:42:14.809 --> 02:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
comprehensive we haven't heard a broad
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
overview about the governor's plan for
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive licensure reform and what
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
changes the agency and the boards would
 
02:42:23.809 --> 02:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
see as a result at the agency we've
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
really been diving into House Bill 2 and
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
we are prepared to offer Finance for the
 
02:42:30.849 --> 02:42:30.859 align:start position:0%
various divisions
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
to come forward and conduct the
 
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
presentation of what is contained if
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
they're in for example regarding nursing
 
02:42:39.290 --> 02:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
assistance you've heard today of the
 
02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
need to regulate nursing assistance and
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
I agree with that what you didn't care
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that there's a federal registry that
 
02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
already requires that we register
 
02:42:49.969 --> 02:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants and we already do so
 
02:42:51.530 --> 02:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
those are the types of things that I
 
02:42:53.050 --> 02:42:53.060 align:start position:0%
think we would be able to bring forward
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
with more than three minutes to spare
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to leave you with that
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
and if you are interested we'd be happy
 
02:43:02.090 --> 02:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
to partner with you on that thank you
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
I can't quite read the name it could be
 
02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.290 --> 02:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony and I
 
02:43:32.450 --> 02:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
also appreciate your stamina on a day
 
02:43:33.650 --> 02:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm Alan rates since 1991 I've owned a
 
02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
home in Plainfield New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:43:41.809 --> 02:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
employed and represent the Hanover Co-op
 
02:43:44.270 --> 02:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
food stores and auto service centers the
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hanover Co-op was founded in 1936 by 17
 
02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
local families
 
02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
today our homegrown business delivers 88
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the local economy
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
thanks to the work of our 350 employees
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is the negative impact
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
housing is having on businesses all
 
02:44:03.889 --> 02:44:03.899 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
02:44:05.929 --> 02:44:05.939 align:start position:0%
years of work by citizens and
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislators have brought you to this
 
02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:08.990 align:start position:0%
legislators have brought you to this
moment

02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
the funding request before you in hb1
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
are the culmination of extensive work
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
Fair debate and balance deliberation
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
as you prepare to take action I
 
02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
specifically urge support for funding
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
for the prioritized need requests and
 
02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
DHHS for homeless services
 
02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
funding of the affordable housing fund
 
02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
funding for invest NH
 
02:44:35.809 --> 02:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
and funding for the historic housing tax
 
02:44:35.819 --> 02:44:37.130 align:start position:0%
and funding for the historic housing tax
credit

02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:44:39.170 --> 02:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
allow me to highlight just one of the
 
02:44:44.570 --> 02:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
the average age of New Hampshire
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
residents is rising rapidly which makes
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care for Seniors all the more
 
02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:51.530 align:start position:0%
Health Care for Seniors all the more
important

02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
yet even though we have top-notch health
 
02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
care facilities nearby the lack of
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
housing means fewer nurses and doctors
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
to perform Critical Care
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
provide service to veterans
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
or give timely treatment to those
 
02:45:08.090 --> 02:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
suffering from chronic disease
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
medical facilities and Clinics across
 
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
our region are not understaffed by
 
02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
choice the Crux of the issue is housing
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
please retain the budget points I have
 
02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:20.809 align:start position:0%
please retain the budget points I have
listed

02:45:20.809 --> 02:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
they are Homegrown Solutions that are
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire right now thank
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:32.090 --> 02:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
did I pronounce the name right Esther
 
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
Connors from Portsmouth
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
and master Kennedy of Portsmouth but I
 
02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
also am the director of student service
 
02:45:46.849 --> 02:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
for the Guilford public schools and I
 
02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
also teach graduate classes and special
 
02:45:52.190 --> 02:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
needs for Plymouth University and I'm
 
02:45:53.929 --> 02:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
here today because
 
02:45:57.469 --> 02:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about all the work
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm doing with our children with
 
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the public school every
 
02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
day and I've been doing it for 30 plus
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
years and then they go to the local
 
02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
agency at 22 and the services are just
 
02:46:12.770 --> 02:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
not there for them
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to support this bill as a
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
public school educator so my work does
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
not go unfounded
 
02:46:24.410 --> 02:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I also think that if there's any
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
chance in the future
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we actually add more money because
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about our autism
 
02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
population in particular and our other
 
02:46:37.010 --> 02:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
students who will have a lot of needs
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
when they reach adulthood and our
 
02:46:41.809 --> 02:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
agencies really need the funding to
 
02:46:41.819 --> 02:46:42.770 align:start position:0%
agencies really need the funding to
contribute

02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
I would also like to add that I do have
 
02:46:48.349 --> 02:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
children currently sitting in
 
02:46:48.359 --> 02:46:49.849 align:start position:0%
children currently sitting in
ers

02:46:49.849 --> 02:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
ers
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
because there's no mental health values
 
02:46:54.889 --> 02:46:54.899 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you all to look at
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
that and move forward on seeing how we
 
02:47:00.889 --> 02:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
can help our population of children that
 
02:47:02.929 --> 02:47:02.939 align:start position:0%
have mental health concerns and what we
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
can do to support them
 
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
again I thank you for your service and I
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Lori McIntyre followed by Sue

years and I am also currently the board

chair of the New Hampshire Healthcare
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%

skilled nursing facilities in the state
 
02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we take great pride in the care that
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
we provide to our residents but we need
 
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
the state's help to continue our
 
02:48:14.809 --> 02:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
expenses have grown exponentially since
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
the pandemic although we have
 
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
significantly increased our own staff
 
02:48:20.809 --> 02:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
wages we have been forced to supplement
 
02:48:23.929 --> 02:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
with agency nursing staff with an annual
 
02:48:26.929 --> 02:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
expense of 1.2 million dollars last year
 
02:48:29.929 --> 02:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
the lack of adequate Medicaid funding
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
limits our ability to further attract
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
competent and dedicated Workforce in
 
02:48:38.090 --> 02:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
such a tight labor market inflation has
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
caused caused significant increases in

the community as well reimbursement just
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
isn't keeping Pace we have turned away
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
patients needing our care from acute
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
care hospitals and members of our
 
02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
community because we must limit census
 
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
to meet our staffing capabilities today
 
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
62 percent of my residents in our

residents daily Medicaid reimbursement
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
further reduced by the budget neutrality
 
02:49:13.849 --> 02:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
Factor does not cover the cost of care
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
for these residents
 
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
we respectfully ask that you provide for
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
a 15 Medicaid rate increase that will
 
02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
help us to address the extraordinary
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
costs and give us the resources to
 
02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
compete in a drastically changed job
 
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:30.660 align:start position:0%

02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure I'm the legislative liaison

area agency of region 10. I'm presenting
 
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
today's private citizen additionally I
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
work as a direct support professional
 
02:50:06.889 --> 02:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
and have since I was 19. we won't
 
02:50:09.170 --> 02:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
mention how many years that's been I
 
02:50:11.450 --> 02:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
currently have a client that I support
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
on a part-time basis
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
I ask that you support the funding in
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1 and House Bill 2. my
 
02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
current plan participates in a day
 
02:50:23.090 --> 02:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
program that takes him into the
 
02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
community of Keene where he continues to
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
learn social skills and interact with
 
02:50:30.349 --> 02:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
peers and community members he and
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
others can attend the day program only
 
02:50:34.849 --> 02:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
if there are staff to transport and
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
support them you're probably aware and
 
02:50:40.090 --> 02:50:40.100 align:start position:0%
you've heard already today but again
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
dsps are some of the lowest paid people
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
in the workforce 13.50 an hour and even
 
02:50:47.929 --> 02:50:47.939 align:start position:0%
lower in some cases and these are adults
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
these are not 13 year olds these
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
potential workers can go to a local
 
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
coffee or Burger Shop and make far more
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
money than they would doing some of the
 
02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
most important work any of us can do
 
02:51:01.130 --> 02:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
caring for fellow human beings
 
02:51:03.290 --> 02:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
in some cases staff who support
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
individuals are making less than the
 
02:51:07.010 --> 02:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
person they support
 
02:51:09.530 --> 02:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
often day programs go unstaffed and
 
02:51:11.570 --> 02:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
clients must spend the day at home with
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
a care provider who might have had to
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
leave a job as there is no one to care
 
02:51:17.330 --> 02:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
for their loved ones and I'd just like
 
02:51:19.010 --> 02:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
to mention that we would typically have
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
far more individuals or fan and families
 
02:51:25.130 --> 02:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
presenting testifying today but because
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
of our dramatically decreased Workforce
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
they just could not get here they are
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
able to provide testimony online for
 
02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we are grateful but we certainly
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
like to have people here in person
 
02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
we support hb1 and hb2 and fund
 
02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
community-based supports and services
 
02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
for people with Developmental and other
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and a Medicaid rate
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
increase to support our very important
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce thank you

those in recovering taxpayers here it is
 
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
a bill was signed into law in 2020
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
establishing that five percent of gross
 
02:52:50.809 --> 02:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
sales of alcohol in New Hampshire be set
 
02:52:50.819 --> 02:52:51.889 align:start position:0%

02:52:53.570 --> 02:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
to fund prevention treatment and

02:52:58.010 --> 02:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund has been tragically

the alcohol fund has been tragically
underfunded

02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
02:53:02.929 --> 02:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
and just so you know in 2024-25
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
that figure is estimated to be 11
 
02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
that figure is estimated to be 11

Harlow just had to say I work with homes

that serve people in recovery
 
02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
we also request that you fully fund the
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund
 
02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:28.380 align:start position:0%

three and a half years in that time
 
02:54:40.250 --> 02:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
we've certified 85 houses that
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
represents over 1100 beds right now
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of work we put a lot of
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%

the community housing program has
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
increased our overall graduation rate by
 
02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
30 percent I've watched a client go from
 
02:56:16.429 --> 02:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
living in a storage unit to living in
 
02:56:19.370 --> 02:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
his own apartment because of CHP support
 
02:56:22.849 --> 02:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
right now 36 out of our 45 let in
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
participants have benefited from the
 
02:56:27.170 --> 02:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
community housing program and 13 out of
 
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
our 21 graduates since the start of CHP
 
02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
can contribute their successes to the
 
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
I asked one of my participants to write
 
02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
a few words I would like to share with
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
you about the community housing program
 
02:56:44.269 --> 02:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
and how it has contributed to his
 
02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
success and his pending graduation from
 
02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
our program in May of this year
 
02:56:50.030 --> 02:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
to whom it may concern the community
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
housing program has been instrumental to
 
02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
my sobriety from the moment I was deemed
 
02:56:56.570 --> 02:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive funding the number
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
of ways I have benefited from this
 
02:57:00.650 --> 02:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
program are measurable today I have just
 
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
over a year sober and I'm and I am in
 
02:57:04.849 --> 02:57:04.859 align:start position:0%

Community from the outside looking in it
 
02:57:11.929 --> 02:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
may seem like all I was given from CHP
 
02:57:14.570 --> 02:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
was funds for a place to live truly it
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
was much more to summarize I was given a
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
new life the community housing program
 
02:57:20.809 --> 02:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
is the foundation of my life without
 
02:57:23.090 --> 02:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
this Foundation I never would have had a
 
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
chance to stand up and fight my
 
02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:26.150 align:start position:0%
chance to stand up and fight my
addiction

private duty nursing rates need to be
 
02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:30.540 align:start position:0%

03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:22.250 align:start position:0%
the financial burden to the Health Care
system

03:01:22.250 --> 03:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
our organization has deep concerns about
 
03:01:26.809 --> 03:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes in hb2 which would
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
change the structure of our current
 
03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
naturopathic Board of examiners to a
 
03:01:33.290 --> 03:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
naturopathic Advisory Board of examiners
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
this proposed change would entail
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
shifting oversight of our profession
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
from a board of our peers and a public
 
03:01:42.590 --> 03:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
member to oversight by a single person
 
03:01:45.650 --> 03:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
the executive director of oplc
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
the proposed Advisory Board which would
 
03:01:49.610 --> 03:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
be comprised of three naturopathic
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
doctors as opposed to the current four
 
03:01:54.010 --> 03:01:54.020 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors and a public member
 
03:01:57.410 --> 03:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
would not have final approval approval
 
03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
over new rules or repeal of rules or
 
03:02:04.429 --> 03:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
changes to our formulary which is a list
 
03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
of medications naturopathic doctors May
 
03:02:08.570 --> 03:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
prescribe in New Hampshire some of which
 
03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
are controlled substances
 
03:02:12.650 --> 03:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
final decisions on these matters would
 
03:02:14.330 --> 03:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
fall exclusively to the executive
 
03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
director of oplc who is not a medical
 
03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
provider with any knowledge of the
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
nuances of the practice of naturopathic
 
03:02:23.809 --> 03:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
medicine or prescribing Pharmaceuticals
 
03:02:25.790 --> 03:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
and these are very very complicated
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
matters we believe these proposed
 
03:02:30.410 --> 03:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
changes pose a risk to Public Safety
 
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
when the sole purpose of oplc is to
 
03:02:34.490 --> 03:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
03:02:36.050 --> 03:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
the current naturopathic Board of
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
examiners is an efficient body that is
 
03:02:39.650 --> 03:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
effective in overseeing the practice of
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medicine due to the small
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
number of licensees in our state and
 
03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
very low number of complaints 11
 
03:02:48.889 --> 03:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
complaints in five years to be exact it
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
costs oplc a very small amount of money
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
to in administrative costs to support
 
03:02:56.090 --> 03:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
our board and therefore we would like to
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
maintain our current board structure
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
we feel the executive director of oplc
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
is not qualified to have final say over
 
03:03:06.050 --> 03:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
adopting and repealing rules or making
 
03:03:08.110 --> 03:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
changes to our prescriptive formulary
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
putting a layperson in charge of
 
03:03:12.889 --> 03:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
decision making about complicated
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
medical practices who has no knowledge
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
of medicine pharmacology or
 
03:03:20.570 --> 03:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals poses a grave threat to
 
03:03:23.330 --> 03:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
Public Safety therefore we respectfully
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
request that sections 454 time is
 
03:03:29.630 --> 03:03:29.640 align:start position:0%

03:03:32.210 --> 03:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you

provide services and supports for
 
03:03:58.250 --> 03:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
individuals who experience a
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
developmental disability or an acquired

I'm here today to provide testimony on
 
03:04:10.730 --> 03:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
behalf of the individuals and families
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
we serve that is in support of funding
 
03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
for developmental disability services
 
03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
and the proposed Medicaid rate increase
 
03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'd like to read one of those letters of
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
support right now and then submit others
 
03:04:28.670 --> 03:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
for your additional
 
03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
reading thank you
 
03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
dear chairman Weiler and members of the
 
03:04:37.490 --> 03:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
house finance committee I don't envy
 
03:04:39.889 --> 03:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
your task I'm sure that there are many
 
03:04:43.130 --> 03:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
causes that deserve taxpayer support I
 
03:04:45.889 --> 03:04:45.899 align:start position:0%
want to put my concern in my concern
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
that you fully fund community-based
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
supports for people with intellectual
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities my daughter Maya had lots
 
03:04:57.469 --> 03:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
of needs she had medical educational and
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
social needs the most stressful need was
 
03:05:02.929 --> 03:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
getting caregivers to watch her before
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
and after school
 
03:05:07.010 --> 03:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
she was an escape artist and without
 
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
supervision would find ways out she had
 
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
little to no awareness of danger we
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
lived close to Lake Winnipesaukee why
 
03:05:18.889 --> 03:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
was getting caregivers stressful I had
 
03:05:21.290 --> 03:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
enough hours in our In-Home Support
 
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
budget but besides those crazy hours
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
that I needed coverage the pay rate that
 
03:05:31.490 --> 03:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
I could offer them was ridiculously low
 
03:05:34.250 --> 03:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
please support an increase in salaries
 
03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
for direct support professionals
 
03:05:39.290 --> 03:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
in order to hire people I had to
 
03:05:41.769 --> 03:05:41.779 align:start position:0%
supplement that salary from the state
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
thankfully I was in a position to do
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
that but most are not
 
03:05:49.370 --> 03:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
person could literally make more money
 
03:05:52.250 --> 03:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
working at Dunkin Donuts with less
 
03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:53.330 align:start position:0%
working at Dunkin Donuts with less
stress

03:05:53.330 --> 03:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
stress
 
03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
being a direct supports professional is
 
03:05:58.610 --> 03:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
something people do because they are
 
03:06:00.170 --> 03:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
called to that
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
it is unfair to take advantage of that
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
by not paying them what they are worth
 
03:06:07.370 --> 03:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time and attention to
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
this letter and I've included a picture
 
03:06:12.170 --> 03:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
of Maya and her caregiver to emphasize
 
03:06:14.450 --> 03:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
that these are real people with real
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
genuine needs thank you Emily James

03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
I learned members of the house finance
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michaela Demeter
 
03:06:37.370 --> 03:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I serve as a member of the Dover
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
School Board though I do not speak for
 
03:06:41.210 --> 03:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
the school board with these comments I'm
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
also a signatory on the letter I just
 
03:06:45.050 --> 03:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
presented written by the New Hampshire
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project and
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
signed by more than 150 locally elected
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
leaders who represent taxpayers in over
 
03:06:54.849 --> 03:06:54.859 align:start position:0%
70 towns and cities across New Hampshire
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
including 12 colleagues from my home
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
city of Dover I'm here today to
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
encourage you to fully fund our public
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
education system by correcting
 
03:07:06.650 --> 03:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
long-standing inequities and gaps and
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the state's constitutional
 
03:07:10.849 --> 03:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide all students with
 
03:07:12.650 --> 03:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
according to data from the U.S Census
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau New Hampshire has the lowest
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of State funding for public
 
03:07:22.250 --> 03:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
education of any state in the country so
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers are forced to
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
Bear over 70 percent of the total cost
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
of public education far exceeding the
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
national average of 44 and a half
 
03:07:31.859 --> 03:07:32.929 align:start position:0%
national average of 44 and a half
percent

03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
being the lowest in the nation is
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
wonderful if we're comparing violent
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
crime statistics or unemployment rates
 
03:07:41.570 --> 03:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
but it's embarrassing when we're talking
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
about education
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
the commission to study school funding
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
established by your legislative body
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
concluded in its final report that quote
 
03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
the state's current estimated cost for
 
03:07:54.349 --> 03:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
an adequate education is not
 
03:07:56.690 --> 03:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
reproducible by any empirically based
 
03:07:59.030 --> 03:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
approach end quote no school district
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
can provide appropriate public education
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
to its pupils using the state's average
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
contribution of just
 
03:08:08.570 --> 03:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
4773 dollars per student because
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers make up the funding Gap left
 
03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
by the state New Hampshire school
 
03:08:14.990 --> 03:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
districts are divided into halves and
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
have-nots based on wildly varying
 
03:08:19.309 --> 03:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
equalized property values in each town
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
or city and wildly varying tax rates as
 
03:08:25.969 --> 03:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
a result sadly quote the commission
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
found that lower student outcomes are
 
03:08:30.650 --> 03:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
directly related to lower total spending
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
per student which is in turn related to
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
lower Property valuations New

Hampshire's Baseline adequacy Aid
 
03:08:38.990 --> 03:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
provides a small fraction of the true
 
03:08:41.450 --> 03:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
cost of Education as evidenced by
 
03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
significantly higher expenses for
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
reported in every single School District
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
in our state you have an opportunity to
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
fix these problems by increasing both
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
Baseline adequacy Aid and targeted aid
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable populations in doing so
 
03:08:57.889 --> 03:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
you will ensure students in every New
 
03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school district have access to
 
03:09:02.570 --> 03:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
the best possible public education while
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%

also benefits the people that work with
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
him okay so it's nice to have inclusion
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the community so we expose people to
 
03:10:48.050 --> 03:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and also people
 
03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
with disabilities that get exposed to
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
the community due to the work for a
 
03:10:54.530 --> 03:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
shortage that we had it took months to
 
03:10:56.570 --> 03:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
put this team together it was really
 
03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
hard to find a qualified direct service
 
03:11:01.010 --> 03:11:01.020 align:start position:0%

want to keep that team together
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities budget
 
03:11:17.690 --> 03:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
and the proposed Medicaid rate increase
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
will help keep them together
 
03:11:22.610 --> 03:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
if this budget is at risk or the the
 
03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
rate increases are at risk it puts this
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
team at risk it helps make my team or
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairs our team apart and the person
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
that is impacted by that is my son

thank you Mr chairman my name is David

Trumbull I'm here on behalf of the Kent
 
03:12:07.130 --> 03:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
Street Coalition today to talk about
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
education funding I have a couple of
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
points to make first of all I'd like to
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
go back to the New Hampshire
 
03:12:15.290 --> 03:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
constitution in the Claremont decision
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of confusion about
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
what the Claremont decision really held
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just reinforce three key
 
03:12:23.210 --> 03:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
points from that decision first it is
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire's duty to
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education to every
 
03:12:30.889 --> 03:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
child not the town's Duty under our
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
constitution it is the state's Duty
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
second this we have to provide an
 
03:12:37.130 --> 03:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
adequate level of funding to every
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
single child in this state and third
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
according to the Supreme Court this Duty
 
03:12:45.230 --> 03:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
applies to the public schools not to any
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
other schools those are additional
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
options but the requirement goes to the
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
public schools this Duty has been on the
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
plate of our governor and our
 
03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
legislature for 30 years and we have
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
never adequately dealt with this it is
 
03:12:59.870 --> 03:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
time that we actually do this the
 
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court made this decision because
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
the importance of an educated citizenry
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
number two the governor's budget is
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
devastating in the long term to the poor
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
schools the governor increases the
 
03:13:13.849 --> 03:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount by eight hundred dollars
 
03:13:15.889 --> 03:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
and then which is about 100 million
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
dollars increase and he increases efas
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
by 50 million dollars that's 150 million
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollar increase where does that come
 
03:13:26.570 --> 03:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
from this year is paid for by the
 
03:13:29.929 --> 03:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
Surplus it covers up any losses but the
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
long-term funding for the Governor's
 
03:13:35.210 --> 03:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
increases comes by eliminating the
 
03:13:37.849 --> 03:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants which is 157
 
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
million the relief date for 18 million
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
now there's an offset with a little bit
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
of extraordinary aid but if you add up
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
what the poor towns lose and what the
 
03:13:49.490 --> 03:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
poor towns get back it's a net loss of
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
112 million dollars per year now that's
 
03:13:55.250 --> 03:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to be phased in over 10 years but
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
the legacy of Governor sununu's
 
03:13:59.570 --> 03:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
education budget is that the poor towns
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this state are going to lose a
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
hundred and 10 million dollars now what
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
does that look like in the real world
 
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
the 20 poorest towns get about four
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per child from the
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund the 70 poorest towns
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
get over 40 percent of their funding
 
03:14:17.690 --> 03:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
from State funding in 10 years these
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
towns are going to lose four thousand
 
03:14:21.410 --> 03:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
dollars if they're only spending fifteen
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
thousand that's all they can come up
 
03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
with from their tax base now they're
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
down to eleven thousand dollars in
 
03:14:28.730 --> 03:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
today's dollars you cannot run a school
 
03:14:31.370 --> 03:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
on eleven thousand dollars I'll ask you
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
to look at what the town of Allenstown
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
did the school board there said what
 
03:14:37.849 --> 03:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
could we afford if all we have is what
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
the state gives us for adequacy they end
 
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
up with this is their formula elementary
 
03:14:43.730 --> 03:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
schools have 29 children in the
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
classroom middle schools 37 and they had
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
to get rid of all busing no educational
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%

03:15:47.210 --> 03:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
and just so I don't get cut off at the
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
end I'll let you know that even though
 
03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to hb2 we are here in
 
03:15:56.110 --> 03:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
support of any potential recommendations
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
by from Edna to retain the bill for
 
03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
further study
 
03:16:04.190 --> 03:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
so the laidac board already administers
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
four credentials with individual scopes
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
of practice Preparatory
 
03:16:12.190 --> 03:16:12.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and ethical nuances
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
consolidating it along with psychology
 
03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
into the board of mental health practice
 
03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
ignores the fundamental differences in
 
03:16:20.769 --> 03:16:20.779 align:start position:0%
the focus
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
experiential learning and educational
 
03:16:26.290 --> 03:16:26.300 align:start position:0%
underpinnings as well as ethical
 
03:16:28.990 --> 03:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of the practice of
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment that a
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
generalist board could not be expected
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
to have the specific knowledge to
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
adequately understand
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the laidac board the voice of the
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
distinct credentials will be lost on the
 
03:16:46.610 --> 03:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
Consolidated board as the as only the
 
03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
highest level of Licensing that M laidac
 
03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
will be retained so my position the
 
03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
Certified Recovery support worker would
 
03:16:55.130 --> 03:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
be gone
 
03:16:57.410 --> 03:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
the substance use treatment profession
 
03:16:59.690 --> 03:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
will have a lone voice on the board that
 
03:17:01.550 --> 03:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
is already heavily weighted to the
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Professions which approach
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
the work with different priorities
 
03:17:07.570 --> 03:17:07.580 align:start position:0%
training and focus
 
03:17:10.750 --> 03:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
licensees and particularly the latex and
 
03:17:13.969 --> 03:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
crsws whose scopes of practice are
 
03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
vastly different than those of mental
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
health providers who must face the board
 
03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
in ethics hearings will find themselves
 
03:17:23.929 --> 03:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
deprived of the right to be heard by a
 
03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
jury of peers as that jury will have no
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
experience in the unique requirements
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
and challenges of their specific
 
03:17:31.319 --> 03:17:33.050 align:start position:0%
and challenges of their specific
professions

03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:17:35.929 --> 03:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
the laidac board has a structured career
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
ladder one of which I intend on trying
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
to climb myself
 
03:17:40.439 --> 03:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
to climb myself
um

03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
that allows the different levels of
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
licensor and certification to build upon
 
03:17:48.530 --> 03:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
each other thereby facilitating and
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
incentivizing the development of the
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder Workforce
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
consolidating of these boards raises the
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
risk of damaging this carefully crafted
 
03:18:01.730 --> 03:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
career ladder as it won is educational
 
03:18:04.910 --> 03:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
and experiential experiential design is
 
03:18:07.150 --> 03:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally fundamentally different
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
and two it fails to define the substance
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
use disciplines while simultaneously
 
03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
excluding the laidac and crsw from the
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
definition of mental health disciplines
 
03:18:22.730 --> 03:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
there is a fundamental loss of identity
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the substance use disorder profession
 
03:18:28.610 --> 03:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
by making it more making more I'm sorry
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
making it more one more member of the
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice the
 
03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
licensees and certificate holders under
 
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
the laidac board are sud providers some
 
03:18:42.889 --> 03:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
of whom hold us a specialty in the
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
practice of mental health treatment
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
this is intrinsically different for all
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
the other professional professions
 
03:18:51.290 --> 03:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
grouped under the Mental Health Board
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
where focus is on practice of mental
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
health while some of them hold a
 
03:18:58.670 --> 03:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
specialty in substance use treatment
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
the laidac board is a member of the
 
03:19:02.690 --> 03:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
international certification and
 
03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
reciprocity Consortium the board of
 
03:19:08.809 --> 03:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
mental health practice is not nor would
 
03:19:11.389 --> 03:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
its other professions be eligible under
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
these rules so this puts hundreds of
 
03:19:16.130 --> 03:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
under the laidac board at risk for
 
03:19:21.290 --> 03:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
losing recipes reciprocity in 42 States
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%

Army your time is expired
 
03:19:30.410 --> 03:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
so thank you I'm getting confused on my
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
cards your name
 
03:19:34.610 --> 03:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
Jessica Carter got it right there's
 
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
another one very like mine earlier thank
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
you Kate fry is next followed by Forrest
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:47.809 --> 03:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
om today
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
um uh so I have handed in our written
 
03:19:53.630 --> 03:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
testimony as as well as a storybook On
 
03:19:56.090 --> 03:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
the Alcohol fund we have several items
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
in the budget that we are highlighting
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
but since I just have a few minutes I
 
03:20:02.090 --> 03:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
will quickly go through this as as
 
03:20:04.190 --> 03:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible but I will leave our
 
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
testimony with you
 
03:20:08.809 --> 03:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
um as you heard today uh new Futures and
 
03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
other Advocates are strongly in support
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
of a fully funded alcohol fund uh new
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
Futures has always advocated for a the
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
fully funding of the alcohol fund since
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
it was created in 2000. five that's just
 
03:20:27.410 --> 03:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
five percent of gross profits from uh
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
generated from alcohol sales in this
 
03:20:29.340 --> 03:20:30.650 align:start position:0%
generated from alcohol sales in this
state

03:20:30.650 --> 03:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they are to be used for the
 
03:20:33.530 --> 03:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
um on other Alcohol and Other Drugs for
 
03:20:38.450 --> 03:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
programming and services for context
 
03:20:40.969 --> 03:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
five percent of gross profit was
 
03:20:44.050 --> 03:20:44.060 align:start position:0%
estimated at 10.3 million in 2021
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
dropping the bucket to the records sales
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
they made Liquor Commission made of 801
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
million in that same year if the
 
03:20:55.969 --> 03:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
alcoholic is alcohol fund is an
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
Innovative fiscally responsible Common
 
03:21:00.170 --> 03:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
Sense approach to a real need in New
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which you heard about uh the
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
fund in the past has either been
 
03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
underfunded or diverted most recently in
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
2018 per the passage of SB 313 the
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund statute although increased
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
to five percent was diverted to be used
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the state share the Medicaid
 
03:21:24.230 --> 03:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
expansion uh requirement this left a
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
hole in the budget fortunately the
 
03:21:28.190 --> 03:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals did backfill those funds
 
03:21:32.330 --> 03:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's until that uh agreement ends in
 
03:21:37.130 --> 03:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
December 2023 so we asked that we fully
 
03:21:39.710 --> 03:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
fund the alcohol fund we also fund
 
03:21:42.769 --> 03:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion but we use the
 
03:21:45.530 --> 03:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
original intent of the law which is for
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
that five percent of gross profits to be
 
03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
used for the Governor's commission
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
funding you have a storybook of some of
 
03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
the great programs that this has allowed
 
03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
to be funded quickly too we ask that the
 
03:21:59.330 --> 03:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
committee look at the agency budget
 
03:22:01.250 --> 03:22:01.260 align:start position:0%

additional Appropriations mainly for

I'm a member of the New Hampshire

organizations and Progressive groups
 
03:25:19.130 --> 03:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
advocating for a budget that invests in
 
03:25:21.889 --> 03:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire people our communities
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the planet
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
and funding that those Investments by
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
taxing the wealthy and corporations to
 
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
pay their fair share so that
 
03:25:34.929 --> 03:25:34.939 align:start position:0%
collectively we have a fair and adequate
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
pool of resources so that we're not
 
03:25:39.769 --> 03:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
pitting affordable housing against
 
03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
public education or mental health
 
03:25:43.389 --> 03:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
supports against
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
a much overdue raise for our state
 
03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
workers or for investments in renewable
 
03:25:48.660 --> 03:25:49.729 align:start position:0%
workers or for investments in renewable
energy

03:25:49.729 --> 03:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm actually here today on behalf of
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire immigrant rights
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
Network so I'll use my remaining time to
 
03:25:56.160 --> 03:25:57.469 align:start position:0%
Network so I'll use my remaining time to
make

03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
to make to lift up our key point which
 
03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
is that we are strenuously opposed to
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
the aspect of hb2 page 34 line seven
 
03:26:10.610 --> 03:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that would create the northern border
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
Alliance program
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
this appears to be an attempt to use New
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer funds for federal
 
03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement activities
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
we urge members of the house finance
 
03:26:24.889 --> 03:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
committee to emphatically reject this
 
03:26:27.769 --> 03:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
program as ill-conceived politically
 
03:26:27.779 --> 03:26:29.050 align:start position:0%
program as ill-conceived politically
motivated

03:26:29.050 --> 03:26:29.060 align:start position:0%
motivated
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
anti-immigrant and gross misuse of
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 enacts a new law enforcement
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
initiative that would be codified as the
 
03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program to be
 
03:26:45.170 --> 03:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
funded annually by more than 1.4 million
 
03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
dollars of non-lapsing taxpayer funds
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
the language in hb2 is very short on
 
03:26:54.769 --> 03:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
specifics but it describes officers
 
03:26:57.130 --> 03:26:57.140 align:start position:0%
engaged in funded activities would be
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
relieved of taking calls for services
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
absent on Emergency
 
03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
in other words the work contemplated by
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation diverts local law
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers from their primary
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
commitments to the communities they
 
03:27:15.650 --> 03:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
serve without any explanation of why we
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
need this additional Alliance program
 
03:27:22.250 --> 03:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
over the past year the Swanton sector of
 
03:27:24.530 --> 03:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
the Customs and Border Protection has
 
03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
seen a market increase in unauthorized
 
03:27:28.849 --> 03:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
border crossings
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear this is the sector
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
that includes it's a 248 mile border
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
only 58 miles of which are in New
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not clear that that
 
03:27:42.530 --> 03:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's any activity happening at our
 
03:27:45.950 --> 03:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
border that necessitates this uh
 
03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:47.809 align:start position:0%
border that necessitates this uh
investment

03:27:47.809 --> 03:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
investment
 
03:27:50.570 --> 03:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
CDP hasn't published any data segregated
 
03:27:53.809 --> 03:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
by state and Governor sununu hasn't
 
03:27:55.969 --> 03:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
cited any examples of apprehensions in
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and all of the instances
 
03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
quoted in the media pertain to Vermont
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and New York
 
03:28:05.090 --> 03:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
to fund the northern border Alliance
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
will undo Decades of work by immigrant
 
03:28:09.290 --> 03:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
Community leaders and Advocates to build

03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Dr Jennifer Sartori and I
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
am representing the board of Podiatry
 
03:28:37.570 --> 03:28:37.580 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to the HBQ proposal to merge the
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry with the Board of
 
03:28:42.180 --> 03:28:44.269 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry with the Board of
Medicine

03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
03:28:46.729 --> 03:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
um well I understand that this proposal
 
03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
may seem like a logical way to
 
03:28:50.690 --> 03:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
streamline operations and save costs I
 
03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
believe it will have a serious negative
 
03:28:54.769 --> 03:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
consequence for the practice of Podiatry
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
as well as for the people of the State
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Podiatry is a
 
03:29:00.050 --> 03:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
specialized field of medicine that
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
requires a unique set of skills and
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
expertise as such that I just undergo
 
03:29:05.809 --> 03:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
extensive training and the diagnosis and
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
treatment of foot and ankle disorders
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
by merging the board of Podiatry Board
 
03:29:11.809 --> 03:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
of Medicine we risk diluting the
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
expertise of podiatrists and reducing
 
03:29:15.050 --> 03:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
their ability to provide Specialized
 
03:29:16.729 --> 03:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
Care to their patients the two degrees
 
03:29:19.370 --> 03:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
are different as well we hold the DPM
 
03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:20.889 align:start position:0%
are different as well we hold the DPM
while

03:29:20.889 --> 03:29:20.899 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine members hold an MD
 
03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
or a do
 
03:29:27.769 --> 03:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
furthermore emerging the two boards
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
would likely result in the loss of focus
 
03:29:32.450 --> 03:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
on specific needs and issues facing the
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
podiatric community
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
we Face unique challenges and concerns
 
03:29:38.990 --> 03:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
that are distinct from those of other
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and we need a
 
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
dedicated board that can address this
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
and provide guidance and support
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
finally I'm concerned that merging the
 
03:29:49.250 --> 03:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
two boards will result in account of
 
03:29:51.729 --> 03:29:51.739 align:start position:0%
lack of accountability
 
03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
we need a clear and accessible process
 
03:29:56.210 --> 03:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
for licensure regulation and discipline
 
03:29:58.729 --> 03:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
if the two boards were merged may become
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
more difficult for podiatrists to
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
navigate these processes and they may be
 
03:30:04.010 --> 03:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
subject to Less Direct oversight and
 
03:30:04.020 --> 03:30:05.150 align:start position:0%
subject to Less Direct oversight and
accountability

03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:30:07.130 --> 03:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons I urge you to
 
03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
reconsider the proposal to merge the
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry with the Board of
 
03:30:12.050 --> 03:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
Medicine I appreciate your time and
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.650 --> 03:30:33.660 align:start position:0%

today we welcome the opportunity to
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
appear before you today during these
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
hearings and commend the New Hampshire
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
General Corp for its attention to this
 
03:31:11.690 --> 03:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
very important subject
 
03:31:15.170 --> 03:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
we are respectfully asking the committee
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
to strike section 431 of hb2 that would
 
03:31:21.530 --> 03:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
repeal Bert licensure since its
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
Discovery in 1895 X radiation has
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
produced and provided enormous benefits
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
to society primarily as a life-saving
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
tool in the diagnosis and treatment of
 
03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:32.330 align:start position:0%

disease
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
the use of the X-ray in the Medical Arts
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
has grown into a sophisticated science
 
03:31:38.450 --> 03:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
that plays a major role in the
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
assessment of virtually all diseases
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
if licensure is repealed New Hampshire
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be one of only six states that do
 
03:31:46.969 --> 03:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
not have education or certification
 
03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
standards in place for persons
 
03:31:52.250 --> 03:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
performing Medical Imaging examinations
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
the production of radiation as used in
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine is an
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
invaluable tool in the diagnosis and
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
treatment of disease even so the use of
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
radiation in medicine is not without
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
risks and an inherent potential of
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
biological damage to healthy tissue
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
any exposure to ionizing radiation
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
however small the dose increases the
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
risk of developing cancer of leukemia
 
03:32:17.090 --> 03:32:17.100 align:start position:0%

and developing fetuses any unnecessary
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
exposure therefore produces a risk
 
03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
without benefit to the patient
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
if mert is repealed health care

potential to produce biological damage
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
not only to the patient but to
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
themselves as well the state and federal
 
03:33:04.729 --> 03:33:04.739 align:start position:0%

03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
taken to protect Public Health through
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturing regulations for electronic

Imaging equipment
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
however like your car the operator
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
determines the use and abuse of this
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
equipment no one would permit no one
 
03:33:21.889 --> 03:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
would permit their car with all of its
 
03:33:23.809 --> 03:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
safety features to be driven by someone
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
who has never been taught to drive
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
and yet we would allow untrained
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
operators of Medical Imaging equipment
 
03:33:33.050 --> 03:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
to expose the patient's radiation that
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
can affect your times expired
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
Generations thank you for your time
 
03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you

hello my name is Sharon borst at this
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
point I believe I should bid you all a
 
03:34:00.729 --> 03:34:00.739 align:start position:0%
good evening hi thank you for staying
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to come and
 
03:34:05.530 --> 03:34:05.540 align:start position:0%
speak today in opposition of hb2 section
 
03:34:09.530 --> 03:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
431. as I said my name is Sharon borst I
 
03:34:12.290 --> 03:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
am a registered right out radiography
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
technologist with the state of New
 
03:34:14.340 --> 03:34:15.229 align:start position:0%
technologist with the state of New
Hampshire

03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
and as with everyone in the medical
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
field we are short staffed and it was
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
imperative to me today and my thing that
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
I come today to speak to you
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
State licensure is important so that we
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
hold Imaging Professionals to a higher
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
standard a standard of education and a
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
standard of safety without education you
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
directly compromise safety safety is
 
03:34:44.090 --> 03:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
compromised by directly increasing the
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
patient dose that can lead to
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
misdiagnoses or missing critical
 
03:34:48.660 --> 03:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
misdiagnoses or missing critical
findings

03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
findings
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
you increase those to staff that will
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
increase long-term effects
 
03:34:57.889 --> 03:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
and as as well as other licensers have
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
people that have disrespected the
 
03:35:00.720 --> 03:35:01.490 align:start position:0%
people that have disrespected the
um

03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:03.889 --> 03:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
standards that have been set forth and
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
have not been licensed and caused harm
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
to other people such as David kajkowski
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
who gave several patients hepatitis from
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
diverting medications
 
03:35:15.239 --> 03:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
diverting medications
um

03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:17.690 --> 03:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
please understand that in the X-ray
 
03:35:20.450 --> 03:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
field we are not just in your emergency
 
03:35:22.370 --> 03:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
room when you break your finger or your
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
arm where your or
 
03:35:28.010 --> 03:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're in your hospital room
 
03:35:29.929 --> 03:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
we're there for you to do Dynamic
 
03:35:31.610 --> 03:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
studies to see how your body actually
 
03:35:34.849 --> 03:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and how
 
03:35:38.809 --> 03:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
so please stop the repeal
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the licensure for medical
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
professionals thank you
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%

Damon Burke Stratford
 
03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the board of natural
 
03:36:05.330 --> 03:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
scientists so we oversee wetlands and
 
03:36:08.210 --> 03:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
soil scientists and we appreciate the
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
update from representative McGuire on
 
03:36:12.650 --> 03:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
the on the
 
03:36:15.650 --> 03:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
including us off the list or taking us
 
03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
off the list so I'm going to try to keep
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
this quick I already submitted testimony
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
but we
 
03:36:24.889 --> 03:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
we protect the natural environment and
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
the public so it's an important role and
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard back from a lot of
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives and folks all around so
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're very encouraged by what's going on
 
03:36:34.380 --> 03:36:35.389 align:start position:0%
we're very encouraged by what's going on
um

03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
we classify delineate and map wetlands
 
03:36:41.290 --> 03:36:41.300 align:start position:0%
and soil resources to help development
 
03:36:45.530 --> 03:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
by if we're not a board and there's no
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientists it would
 
03:36:49.849 --> 03:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
actually slow down the process and
 
03:36:53.450 --> 03:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
require Des to do more Army Corps so
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
take away
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of the control of local boards and
 
03:37:00.889 --> 03:37:00.899 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if we were taken away
 
03:37:03.530 --> 03:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
it would put a burden on local
 
03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
municipalities which have us written
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
down as Wetland and soil scientists and
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
their regulation rely on us so those are
 
03:37:15.650 --> 03:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
all very important things and certainly
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
engineerings and surveyors a lot rely on
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
us and specific to our certification we
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
have an exam written exam and then a
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
field exam so it really puts the
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
emphasis on New Hampshire what we do so
 
03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
we actually take applicants out in the
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
field and test them so that's that's
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
about all I'm gonna do and I know
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's other uh organizations around
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
the country but it's sort of like uh do
 
03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
we want federal or we want local so by
 
03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
being local in New Hampshire we're
 
03:37:49.140 --> 03:37:50.290 align:start position:0%
being local in New Hampshire we're
really

03:37:50.290 --> 03:37:50.300 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
certifying individuals that are doing
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
good work for uh developers local
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state and Des so
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to keep it short and
 
03:38:03.769 --> 03:38:03.779 align:start position:0%

I guess Steve Rancourt isn't here
 
03:38:32.690 --> 03:38:32.700 align:start position:0%

and she's a blessing
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%

03:40:54.650 --> 03:40:54.660 align:start position:0%

I wanted to tell you too that um
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
Caitlin's psychiatric disorders
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to include depression and
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
the frustration of not being able to
 
03:41:06.969 --> 03:41:06.979 align:start position:0%
speak in the way that you and I do
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn has been in residential care
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
since she was about 14 years old
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
she lived at crotchet Mountain for seven
 
03:41:16.729 --> 03:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
years and excelled in Leaps and Bounds
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
her father and I both live fairly close
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
and we were able to see her and bring
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
her home often
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
she then moved to enhanced Family Care
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
the first placement didn't work it
 
03:41:30.650 --> 03:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
wasn't a good fit at all the second
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
placement went well
 
03:41:35.090 --> 03:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
until her daily support staff had an
 
03:41:37.729 --> 03:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
injury and was not able to work
 
03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
this leftover care provider providing
 
03:41:42.290 --> 03:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
24-hour care
 
03:41:49.130 --> 03:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%

I thought you lost my card
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Carol Townsend and
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
this is Kim danis we are the newly
 
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
appointed chair and co-chair for the New
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nurses Association Commission
 
03:42:31.729 --> 03:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
on government affairs
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
um we are registered nurses and I have a
 
03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
combined 60 years of nursing experience
 
03:42:39.250 --> 03:42:39.260 align:start position:0%
and with nurses aides before
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
on page 188 section 466 of House Bill 2
 
03:42:45.530 --> 03:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes removing the licensure
 
03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
requirement for nursing assistance we
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
are in agreement with the Board of
 
03:42:51.290 --> 03:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
Nursing that we would like this remote
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
so I won't expand on that it's in my
 
03:42:54.769 --> 03:42:54.779 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
on page 188 section 467 of House Bill 2
 
03:43:01.130 --> 03:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes to reduce the size of
 
03:43:03.469 --> 03:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
the Boards of Nursing from 11 members to
 
03:43:03.479 --> 03:43:04.309 align:start position:0%
the Boards of Nursing from 11 members to
five

03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:43:06.769 --> 03:43:06.779 align:start position:0%
and reduce the overall number of nurses
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
from five to two which can be either RNs
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
or LPNs we oppose a reduction of the 11
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
to 5 members as this will only create
 
03:43:18.410 --> 03:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
more of a barrier to the workforce and
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
result in delays of throughput
 
03:43:22.610 --> 03:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing is responsible for
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
standards of practice criteria for
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
licensure and continuing education
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and approval of
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
educational programs the nurse Practice
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
Act states that the LPN shall practice
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of the RN and
 
03:43:39.410 --> 03:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
therefore these are not interchangeable
 
03:43:41.690 --> 03:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
reducing the numbers of RNs on the board
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
limits the knowledge and expertise
 
03:43:45.410 --> 03:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
required to establish standards for
 
03:43:45.420 --> 03:43:46.370 align:start position:0%
required to establish standards for
practice

03:43:46.370 --> 03:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:43:50.210 --> 03:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
and my last point on page 78 section 226
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 the bill proposes a
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
delay of the effective date of the
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
implementation of a workplace violence
 
03:44:01.729 --> 03:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
program two years out to July of 2020
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
. the findings from the New Hampshire
 
03:44:04.729 --> 03:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
Healthcare violence prevention
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
Consortium reported that violence was
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
experienced across all responding age
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
groups and during multiple stages of
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%

per week for many staff and enacted by a
 
03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
variety of individuals including
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
patients family members and co-workers
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most important finding is
 
03:44:32.570 --> 03:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
that 54 of health care workers did not
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
feel safe in their place of work in
 
03:44:37.550 --> 03:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
addition to potential and our actual
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
harm to healthcare staff it is important
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
to note that violence in health care
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
settings put patient and health health
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
and safety at risk as well thank you for
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
and was the second person Kimberly or
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Cherry thank you members of
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
the committee for your patience and your
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
hard work and time today I am the chair
 
03:45:09.170 --> 03:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
of the legislative committee for the New
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of natural
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
resource scientists we have provided
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
written comment I just wanted to follow
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
up on a few key points in our comments
 
03:45:19.250 --> 03:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's particularly to read but statements
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
that were provided today we are the
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
association that is a Statewide
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
non-profit Professional Organization
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
whose membership includes Wetland
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
scientists soil scientists and Wildlife
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
biologists from the professional
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
community and the state's academic and
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
public sectors and we are your
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
environmental resource protectors and
 
03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
the state and we're very proud of that
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
fact our legislative committee has
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed House Bill 2 and we strongly
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
oppose section 453 of House Bill 2 which
 
03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
would repeal the functions of the board
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
of natural scientists and the
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
certifications including the certified
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
Mountain scientists and the certified
 
03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
soil scientists two important points
 
03:45:57.050 --> 03:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
that were brought up today there is no
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
National license or certification for a
 
03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
professional Wetland science or
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
professional soil scientist there has
 
03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
been proposing that there are similar
 
03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
type of certifications and licensors but
 
03:46:10.250 --> 03:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
as we detailed in our comments that were
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee there are no
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
in fact no comparisons to what we do
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire we
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
have a certification process that uses a
 
03:46:21.950 --> 03:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
test field testing a combination of
 
03:46:23.870 --> 03:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
education and experience and we believe
 
03:46:25.849 --> 03:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
that that is essential and necessary to
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
continue the protection of these
 
03:46:29.769 --> 03:46:29.779 align:start position:0%
resources in our state there are over
 
03:46:32.090 --> 03:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
180 professional Wetlands certified
 
03:46:33.769 --> 03:46:33.779 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientists that are working in
 
03:46:35.929 --> 03:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
the state and the certified Wetland
 
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
scientists and the certified soil
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
scientists are important roles in Des
 
03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we provide the the support to those
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
permitting processes that as Mr Burt has
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out from the board if we do not
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
have that process in place we would have
 
03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
to refer to Des staff to do that which
 
03:46:54.530 --> 03:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
are already overworked and and we have a
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
very long permitting backlog that we're
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
currently all working against it at this
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
point so it's important that we keep
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
these Protections in place as well as in
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
support of our municipalities who rely
 
03:47:06.170 --> 03:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
on this the conservation commissions to
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
rely on the Wetland scientists and we
 
03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
are supporting the reward reorganization
 
03:47:13.250 --> 03:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
and merging with other relevant boards
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
if it would streamline the certification
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
process and make it easier to maintain
 
03:47:19.370 --> 03:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
provided that the standards for
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
certified button scientists and
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
certified soil scientists are not
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
lowered and that we do provide adequate
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
representation on that board I think
 
03:47:28.610 --> 03:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
those are the main points and I just
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring those up to your
 
03:47:32.210 --> 03:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
attention those are the items that we
 
03:47:35.570 --> 03:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
are countering and again we strongly
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 2 Section 453 and
 
03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
we're happy to hear that we're when the
 
03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
CWS and CSS have been pulled out of this
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
legislation to be
 
03:47:47.690 --> 03:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
free so thank you very much for your
 
03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:48.469 align:start position:0%
free so thank you very much for your
time

03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:53.150 --> 03:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
and lastly I told Dr Warner she could
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.290 --> 03:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so very much for allowing me
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
to speak again
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
I'm Dr Deborah Warner and I'm taking off
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
my board hat
 
03:48:17.150 --> 03:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
I wore it all that time so I could just
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
take it off
 
03:48:21.530 --> 03:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking as an individual I'm a
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist in Littleton New Hampshire
 
03:48:26.929 --> 03:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
I've worked in many settings I've also
 
03:48:28.250 --> 03:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
been on the board of mental health
 
03:48:30.650 --> 03:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
practice when it was involved the
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
psychologists before and I'm as you know
 
03:48:37.610 --> 03:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
I serve in a similar capacity today on
 
03:48:39.530 --> 03:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
our board which I'm not speaking for I'm
 
03:48:41.929 --> 03:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
telling you some things that I
 
03:48:45.170 --> 03:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
they pertain to my experiences
 
03:48:45.180 --> 03:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
they pertain to my experiences
um

03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation proposes an experiment
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
that she prescribes an experiment that's
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
already happened and failed the board of
 
03:48:56.690 --> 03:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
mental health practice had the
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
psychologist for 15 years after we had
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
already been an independent board for 50
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
years before that
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
we have been successful board and they
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
merged them together it did not go well
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
in 15 years the board of mental health
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
with in inadequate professional depth it
 
03:49:19.260 --> 03:49:20.269 align:start position:0%
with in inadequate professional depth it
was

03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:49:22.750 --> 03:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
struggled to regulate the professions
 
03:49:27.410 --> 03:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
and it made many mistakes there were a
 
03:49:30.889 --> 03:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
number of Supreme Court appeals that
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
succeeded in overturning the board
 
03:49:36.530 --> 03:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
decisions quite a few times it was then
 
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
judged by the national insurers and had
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
a reputation nationally that New
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the worst state in which
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
to practice psychology
 
03:49:50.150 --> 03:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
our insurers
 
03:49:54.170 --> 03:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
put in testimony 10 years ago when we
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
faced this Exodus originally which
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't have to do again
 
03:50:00.479 --> 03:50:01.309 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't have to do again
um

03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:04.370 --> 03:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
and they put in testimony to that that
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
it was the most dangerous state
 
03:50:10.190 --> 03:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
if professionals avoided moving to our
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
state you couldn't get psychologists to
 
03:50:15.410 --> 03:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
come we have a shortage of health
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
professionals we don't need to drive
 
03:50:21.290 --> 03:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
them away our state was upgraded in the
 
03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
insurance rates we paid higher Insurance
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
than the other states
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
I just want to tell you there's no
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
animosity between these professions
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
we've worked together on cases it's fine
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
we get along fine we just are in it's
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to be regulating each
 
03:50:40.610 --> 03:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
other we bring different things to the
 
03:50:40.620 --> 03:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
other we bring different things to the
table

03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to let you know this is not as
 
03:50:47.210 --> 03:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure at all the fees for
 
03:50:49.389 --> 03:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
licenses cover
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
125 of the cost of operating our license
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
it's not State money you you profit you
 
03:51:00.290 --> 03:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
get more there's a there's a bonus for
 
03:51:01.729 --> 03:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
this day
 
03:51:04.490 --> 03:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
there would be only four members that
 
03:51:06.410 --> 03:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
are professionals on this five-member
 
03:51:06.420 --> 03:51:07.790 align:start position:0%
are professionals on this five-member
board

03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
one is a psychologist who could be
 
03:51:12.050 --> 03:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
either a regular psychologist or a
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
school psychologist there's a drug and
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
alcohol counselor a master's level
 
03:51:19.610 --> 03:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
health counselor and a social worker and
 
03:51:22.190 --> 03:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
only one public member on our board now
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
and before there were three public
 
03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
members we value the public members they
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
provide a good balance and help the
 
03:51:33.229 --> 03:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
issues and the impact on the community
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
be weighed out in a balanced fashion
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
I want to say also that the one
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
psychology member who would be either a
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
regular psychologist of which there's
 
03:51:46.250 --> 03:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
more than 20 specialties
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
or a school psychologist who's not
 
03:51:52.190 --> 03:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to practice outside of a school
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
that they don't they could not cover the
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
diversity of care
 
03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
if that school psychologist is a cags
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
certificate of advanced graduate study
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is a one-year certificate
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
they are going to be badly compromised
 
03:52:11.690 --> 03:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
and in underqualified
 
03:52:14.110 --> 03:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the rest of the profession
 
03:52:17.150 --> 03:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
this is a bad idea I wanted to make sure
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
this got on record because I hope we
 
03:52:21.769 --> 03:52:21.779 align:start position:0%
don't have to face this again in 10
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
years and I hope we take care of it now
 
03:52:26.570 --> 03:52:26.580 align:start position:0%

03:52:28.729 --> 03:52:28.739 align:start position:0%

03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
