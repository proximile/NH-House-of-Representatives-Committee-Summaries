e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
morning everyone I'm going to call the
 
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
executive session of the house Judiciary
 
00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
Committee to order and would you first
 
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
please uh rise and join me in the pledge
 
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
please uh rise and join me in the pledge
of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the repic for it stands
 
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
one nation God indivisible with liberty
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
and justice for all but I also ask if
 
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
you just take a moment silence to
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
recognition of the aine tragedy that
 
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 align:start position:0%
um right so um the first order of
 
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
business I'm going to take up is um it's
 
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
it's basically a doover to correct
 
00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 align:start position:0%
really what what was uh a mistake on my
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
part um you will recall that we have
 
00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 align:start position:0%
already exact voted on and sent reports
 
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
to uh the clerk on House Bill 98 and
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 164 FN and those were both
 
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
unanimous votes of uh the committee um
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we did that executive
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
session when we had already placed a
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
notice in the calendar saying we would
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
do that today I think there might be an
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
issue that technically we might be all
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
right because the we might have actually
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
held the executive session before it got
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
put in the calendar but that's
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
questionable Paul clerk rightly wants to
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
make sure all the eyes are dotted and
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
the te's are cross and so for that
 
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
reason um he requested and I agree that
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
we should revote on uh uh on House Bill
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
98 and on 164 so I'm going to uh uh
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
reopen so um on 164 the amendment that
 
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
updates the fiscal note is actually
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
ready it's upstairs in the office do you
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
want me to bring that down this was
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%

Manos would you like to speak to your
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair um Mr chair uh
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
I I recommended itl on this um on this
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
HR for several reasons the doctrine of
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh disparate impact is a Judicial uh
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
Doctrine and and I don't think that the
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislature can bind can bind the
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
Judiciary on decisions about disparate
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
impact but in addition to that I think
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um although the Judiciary May um
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
use disparate impact improperly in some
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
cases I think that this HR uh paints too
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
broad a brush and for that reason I
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
would recommend to the committee itl on
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
this HR all right thank you anyone else
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
wish to speak representative organ um I
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
mean I I not sure if I understood all of
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
it but um it aside from the merits of
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
having an HR in this at all like it
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
presumably needed more work when he had
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
his written testimony on it was much
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
more detailed and um it was a little it
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
was like a little more understandable um
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
and also there was a drafting ER in here
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
they going to send it they should just
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
said to the governor of New Hampshire
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the identity the governor of New
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire changed between when he
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
submitted it and uh when he when we
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
considered it so it is in fact Kelly iot
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
rather than Chris the newo so I think
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
even if we wanted to move forward it
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
would need an extensive Amendment so um
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
so I gra support the itl but I
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
congratulate him and his uh wife on on
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
their new baby so that's that's good
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
thanks all right anyone else wish to be
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
heard on hr6 so I guess what I what the
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say on hr6 is as um
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
I think that there are that there are
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
problems with the doctrine of disparate
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
impact and that it at as it has been
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
used uh by the courts in various places
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
at both the federal and state level I
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
think it's it's been used
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriately in many cases but I
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
don't think it's true that it's been
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
used inappropriately in all cases
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
and this um HR really to me paints with
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
just two brought a brush number one and
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
number two I just uh you know as a
 
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.549 align:start position:0%
number two I just uh you know as a
general

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
proposition um I I'm I question the
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
value of HRS anyway I mean which
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
basically it's not a it's not a law it's
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
us you know saying something and uh at
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
at the very least if we're going to say
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
it I think it ought to be it ought to be
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
really accurate and I'm I'm with
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
deference to the author of this of this
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
I don't I think it's it's just it it's
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
it paints something that's that's more
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
complicated with with with sort of too
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
broad a brush and oversimplify so I'm
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also uh in favor of itl anyone else
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh wish to be
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
motion I move a to pass with Amendment
 
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
motion I move a to pass with Amendment
2025

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
d178 second okay all
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.310 align:start position:0%

right

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
um all right and representative katab
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh first dealing with the amendment
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to the
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
amend so we heard about a few issues
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
with the udman office in the testimony
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
although overwhelmingly we heard much
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
great testimony
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that was really
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
concerning to there were two issues that
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
were really concerning to me and the
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
first one was it seemed as if kind
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
of law fair so to speak was being used
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
to dissuade parties from filing with the
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
um budsman and so when they were filing
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities were
 
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.269 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities were
threatening

00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
um or or turning the other party in
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
or their friend for unauthorized
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
practice of law when they were getting
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
um help from somebody but there was
 
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.110 align:start position:0%
um help from somebody but there was
no

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
no
[Music]

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
um exchanging of fees
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um and so it it just wasn't
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
right it was it was it was really
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
dissuading parties from running and the
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
other the other piece was that
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
um they were also threatening you know
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
basically asking for for attorney fees
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
from the municipality and this was
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
really supposed to be more of like a
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
citizen to Citizen type of an office
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
where you're not going through court and
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
so if one party is choosing to to use an
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
attorney that's fine but the other party
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
then shouldn't be expected that they're
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay for the other
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
party's attorney fees and you know if
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
the other party should Prevail so this
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
is just simply preventing these two
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
issues that we heard about from
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
happening I think it's important that we
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
make the office access to people without
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
fear of these kind of I
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
guess uh retribution or negative action
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
so to
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
speak anyone else have anything they
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
want to say on we're talking about the
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment now anybody else have anything
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
they want to say um on the amendment Bob
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
um before I say what I'm thinking on the
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
amendment let me just ask the the motion
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
is as I heard it that we Mo we move
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment rather than
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
merely adopting the amendment can we
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
split the question and vote on the
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
amendment first that's yeah that's what
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we are that's we're we're
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
going to vote on the amendment first and
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
then you know if depending on the
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
outcome of that then we would vote on
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the on the main bill so um the uh so the
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
ISS the question before us now is um is
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
on the amendment anybody else have
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
anything they else they want to say on
 
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.590 align:start position:0%
anything they else they want to say on
the

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendment all right so again because
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
this is an amendment I think we don't
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
have to have a roll call vote on this I
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean obviously I should say if anybody
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
wants a roll call vote we'll have a roll
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
call vote but I don't think we need to
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
have one um and so what I would ask is
 
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.149 align:start position:0%
have one um and so what I would ask is
on

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
2025 0170 H can I see a show of hands of
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
hand anyone oppos to the amendment all
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
right so the amendment is um on the
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
amendment the vote
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
is 16 to1 all right there were two I'm
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
on K
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
16 all right so uh the amendment um is
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
adopted and now um the issue before us
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
is uh is uh otpa and I recognize uh
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative kutab do you anything you
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
want to say on anything further you want
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
no that's okay all right any yes
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
chair um while I do understand as
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who voted to create this office
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
um we put in a two-year Sunset because
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do know uh we wanted to try out see
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
how it worked I think there are some
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
significant problems with the office as
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
drafted and the fiscal note would just
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
extend the office for two years and I'm
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
not willing to extend an office that I
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
think is fundamentally flawed um it
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
either needs more funding so that we can
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
give him the staff that he needs um or
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
we need to go back to the drawing board
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
so I can't vote in favor of this motion
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be heard
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
on yeah uh similar comments to
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander it seems to me
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
that we need an ombudsman's office that
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
acts as an ombudsman uh and the the way
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
it is currently structured uh the
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman is not able to act as an
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
ombudsman he's merely able to act as an
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrator I think that we either need
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
to restructure so that it is better
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
funded and and differently organized uh
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
or we need to uh itl the bill and if
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're moving on this right now I will I
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
shall be it telling recommending that
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish should be heard
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Perez I agree that it
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
revamped 100% but I don't believe that
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
that requires more money I think it
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
requires just um revamping it and
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
rewarding it so I'm opposed to putting
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
more money into it we can't afford it so
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard so I guess
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
here here's my as I I think I've said
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
this before um this bill is going to go
 
00:27:32.919 --> 00:27:33.669 align:start position:0%
this before um this bill is going to go
to

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
finance I I don't have particularly
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
strong objections to the Views that have
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
been expressed by representative
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
McFarland and representative
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
Alexander um I tend to agree with
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative Perez that I'm not sure I
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be willing to put more money into
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
this and I'm quite sure that Finance is
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to have an issue with that but on
 
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
going to have an issue with that but on
the

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
policy on the
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
policy question that's sort of before us
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
I I think it would send the wrong
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
message to say to people um in the
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
public that the
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
the this this committee doesn't support
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
um the right to no on budsman
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
because I think from what we heard at
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing there are really different
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
views on whether the ombudsman
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
um no I don't think there's any question
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
that that it would be better if the
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
udman had more resources but even with
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
the udman operating the way it is it
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
seems to me that there were different
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
views on whether um the
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
udman keeping the udman or getting rid
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
of the udman is a is a wise move I know
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
that you know right to know New
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and those people on those we
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
heard from those groups they seem to say
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
it was you know it was better let's keep
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the UN
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I know and I think this is something
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's important it's obviously not a
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
scientific study uh but the
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative from the judicial branch
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
did note that in the relative in a year
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
year and a half whatever it's been that
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman has been in place there
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
have been a reduction in filings of
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
right to know appeals in the superior
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
court and bear in mind that that it
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
costs a lot more money um and I and I
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
think most of the time anyway takes a
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
lot more time uh to have right to know
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
matters adjudicated in before the courts
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
than uh before the than before the udman
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm going to be voting in
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
favor of the uh the
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
otpa even though you know candidly if if
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
it when this goes to finance if Finance
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
decides to kill this for the money
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
issues I'm I'm not gonna you know that's
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be shedding too many
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
tears but I will be voting for the otpa
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else representative Smith
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um you've
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
heard me say this before and you'll hear
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
me say this again I hope I don't shock
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
anyone life is not
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
perfect and what we're trying to do here
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
is the best we can do with the tools
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
available I don't know of anyone who
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
thinks that the concept of an ombudsman
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
is on its face wrong for the citizens of
 
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
is on its face wrong for the citizens of
this

00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
state do I think we've gotten it all
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
right absolutely not and it's probably
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
not the only Bill on this list where we
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
don't get it all right but I think it's
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
very important and I support the
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
Chairman's view that the message we want
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
to send is that the concept of an um man
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
is is the right concept for the State of
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it is not perfect we
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
current I believe has been working very
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
hard to do his best and I think the
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
least we should do is continue that
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
effort so I not thinking this is perfect
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
at all do intend to support it anyone
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on uh the mo yes
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland just just one
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
followup um and that is to your point um
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
I I think we can all appreciate that
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
this is saving us money in the court
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
system uh and so when we're talking
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we should be
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
prepared as a body to contemplate
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
additional funds into the ombudsman's
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
office we should be understanding that
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
it's offsetting that cost in the court
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
system uh which we've already discussed
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
is overbed
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't regard it as being
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
new spending I regard it as being a
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
question of can we shift and be more
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
efficient in our spending I appreciate
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yes representative
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
horon um well this this amount of money
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
I mean it may be enough so Finance cuts
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
it when they're scrambling around to get
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
a budget together luckily you're
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
probably thankful Mr chairman you're not
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
on that committee and the ranking member
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
probably feels that way too but anyway
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
yeah this is amazingly actually low
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
price for for what we're getting and
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
we're not and considering how little
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
resources we're doing he seems to be
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
doing a fine job so seems to be money
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
well spent so I guess it's it's a
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
bargain in the larger scheme of things
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to keep it going for two
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
more years anyone else wish to be heard
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the motion uh on the otpa
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
motion all right um hearing none I guess
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're ready for a vote on uh and the
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
motion is uh otpa with the uh rep
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%

have it by the end of the day today
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um we're doing so well
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
moving right along here I wonder if you
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
would consider changing the order of the
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
bills as they appear before us because
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
they're here um in an order in which
 
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.389 align:start position:0%
they're here um in an order in which
we're

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
well never mind I take it back I take it
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
back all right so um next I would like
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
to uh turn
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
to uh and I before we sort of you know
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
formally ask for motions or anything
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
like that I'd like to I'd like to have a
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
discussion about HB 66 FN and hb40 and
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
hb7 74 and I'd like to have the
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
discussion um General I just I want to
 
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
get a sense of how the committee feels
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
so I I guess what what I would do is I
 
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
would start
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
off and what I would say is
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
this my my caucus and again I'm if if
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
I've misstated this somebody will will
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
correct me but I think my caucus would
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
say that we would be prepared to vote
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
66 as it is now that would
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
mean um the for lack of a better term
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
the broadest possible disclosure
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
availability under the right to no law
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and the the three the three things
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
that it would do is first it would
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
change the references in the right to no
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
law that mentioned citizen it would
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
change that to say person so it would be
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
any person not any citizen um the second
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
thing um that it would do and this is
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
kind of really a minor thing the the it
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
would allow it would provide it would
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
specifically say that if you have
 
00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:28.309 align:start position:0%
specifically say that if you have
preliminary

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
preliminary
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
um preliminary drafts that are
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
circulated to a quorum of a of a commit
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
of a committee or board at a meeting
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
those are subject to the right to no law
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
as we heard in testimony those are
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
really subject to the right to no law
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
already but representative Edwards felt
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
and I thought he was right on this that
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
it it probably helps to emphasize it by
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
putting it right in that particular
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
place where you're talking about this I
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
think it I think it uh it it makes sense
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
to do that um the next thing uh
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
substantively that that 66 does is it
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
says that you can request records
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
remotely in other words you don't have
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the you know the town offices
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
or the State offices you can request
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
records remotely and if you make a
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
request remotely and ask that the
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
records be provided electronically the
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
the governmental entity has to comply
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
with that and has to provide them in the
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
format that you request as if they have
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
the records in that format um uh and if
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
it would not be unduly burdensome for
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
them to provide the records to you in
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
that format um or you know or if it
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
would not in any way interfere with the
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
security of their recordkeeping system
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
um but if those those things are true
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
then the M then the municipality or the
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
state has to provide that
 
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.630 align:start position:0%
state has to provide that
information

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
I I think I I'm really sort of torn
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
because on one level I like the idea of
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
having it be as broad as
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
that what that you know we what that
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
means however is you know we use we use
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
the example somebody that you know
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
somebody in China that is sitting in
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
their bedroom in their pajamas at
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
midnight that decides they want all the
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
records of
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
communications um uh among the employees
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the town of Windam can do that and
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
say send them to me electronically and
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
the town of Windam would have to respond
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
and that's can be more than I mean
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
unless they unless they had a legitimate
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
basis like it's it's overly burdensome
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever um they unless they had a
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
basis they would have to respond
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
I recognize that
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's that could
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
be quite
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
burdensome I I
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that as as representative Smith
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative Perez
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out during the hearings on this
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
um although that is true it doesn't seem
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
like there's been a lot of those kind of
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't I use China as you know
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's the extreme example but it
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like there's been a ton of
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
those kind of requests from out of state
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
but or out of the country but there have
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
been some I mean we got an email from uh
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth saying that it got one at
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
least one from Argentina somebody in
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
Argentina so it's not to say that there
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
are none
 
00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:50.589 align:start position:0%
are none
um

00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
so my our the Republican caucus could
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
support 66 as as drafted but if there is
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
a concern and I completely understand
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
the concern I
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
have an amendment which has been passed
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
out to all of you which is
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.630 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
2025

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
110110 and this
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment amends only section four of
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and as if you look at
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
at it what you'll see is that in
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
subsection a of the
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendment it imposes a requirement that
 
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.309 align:start position:0%
amendment it imposes a requirement that
the

00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
that the person who is
 
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
that the person who is
making

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
um the request without physically
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
appearing must have a New Hampshire
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
Connection in the sense that they are
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
either domiciled in New Hampshire own
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
property in New Hampshire pay New
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxes maintain a place of
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire are or are
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
registered to do business in New
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or if you're a member of the
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
media that the that New Hampshire
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
connection doesn't apply but those
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions would apply if you're
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
making the request without physically
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
appearing so if we if we adopted this
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendment what that would mean in my
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
example the person in China if the
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
person in China wanted to come to
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
plastow to the town offices and say I
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
want all the communications they could
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
do that but if they want to send an
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
email saying U send all the records from
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know of Communications in plast out
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do that they would have to
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
come personally people that live people
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
um that want to come personally they
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction on them but if
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're if you're asking for remote
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
production um then you have to uh you
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
have to have a New Hampshire uh
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
connection um and subsection B Just the
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
the key word here
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
is s the word such and in subsection B
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
at the election of such person that is
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the person that owns is domiciled in New
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has B does business etc etc
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
those people can ask that the records um
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh be provided in the in the way that um
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
request everybody who who who comes to
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
who's willing to come physically to the
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
town can can get um can get the records
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
whether you live in China or not
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
so this it seems to me this you know we
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony from um is it Mr
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
castina is it from the school boards
 
00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:54.829 align:start position:0%
castina is it from the school boards
Association

00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
um is it Barrett Christina Christina yes
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
so he said you know he did say that they
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
they get like he refer I think he
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
referred to like some you know some
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
business entity in California they the
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
the some school board will get a request
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
for some information and they'll say um
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know fine I think I think there and
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
there he
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
is he um he said that and what and what
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
they say is you know we have the records
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
are available the records are available
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
just come and get them um and and and he
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
and as he said and I think probably
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
correctly what that usually means is
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
they don't come and get because they
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't want them that bad to make a trip
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
to to New Hampshire to come and get them
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
so that is a you know that is an if we
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment that is an
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
effective way to limit who is going to
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
be making the requests for remote
 
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.309 align:start position:0%
be making the requests for remote
production

00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
production
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
um and I can live with
 
00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:02.430 align:start position:0%
um and I can live with
that

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
I you know I just I mean it's some sense
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's contrary to the spirit of the
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
right to no law in the sense that the
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
right to no law we're not supposed to be
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
discouraging people from getting records
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
and we're not supposed to be concerned
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
about why they want the records um this
 
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
is a little contrary to that but but
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
there I can see there you know that
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
they're maybe we don't want people in
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
China sitting around in their pajamas
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
asking to you know the town of plastow
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
to provide all their records so I can I
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
can live with either one of either with
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment or without the amendment
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
and I ask for your comments uh
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and then
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
could you just tell me how you would
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
media I would basically Define it
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
as as you know sort of the same second
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's defined in the statute we defined
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
102 okay that's no that's true that is
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
true there is a there is a definition in
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
there of um yeah but I and I I mean it's
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's pretty broad it's not you know it's
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think you have to what do it say
 
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.750 align:start position:0%
I think you have to what do it say
something

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
about yeah yes thank you very much as
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
usual all these younger people have you
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
know access to the electronic stuff that
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
leaves me cold you know why while we
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
waiting for that represent Perez did you
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
have something comment you want my only
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
concern is that you have owns property
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire pays New Hampshire
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
taxes literally I could go out to
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
dinner and pay a tax because we really
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
don't have any taxes do you want to say
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
pays real estate taxes literally I could
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
go out to dinner and say well I paid you
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
know this tax tax or I went to a state
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
at a hotel and I played that Tech the
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
definition of pays ta New Hampshire
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxes since we supposedly don't have any
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
I have a that's my only concern and it
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
may be trivial you know you know what no
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
I mean it's you know I mean you're right
 
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.750 align:start position:0%
I mean it's you know I mean you're right
I

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
guess here's the problem I think with
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
all with all of this
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
realistically I suppose you could say
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know if the guy from China had
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
actually come to New Hampshire and had
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
dinner and paid well maybe they you know
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
he is arguably a little bit more worthy
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
of making the request than somebody who
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
in China who hasn't done that but not in
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
pajamas but not in pajamas would make it
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
even better but but you know the other
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
thing I think that you point out which I
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
I think is really
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
correct even if we adopt this
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
amendment this is going to be very easy
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
to get around you know the what what's
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that somebody in China
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
who wants to get records electronic Al
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be able to find somebody
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or somebody you know
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody in New Hampshire I
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
guess I would say to make the request
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
for them and once that person gets the
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
records there's no restriction the
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
person can do whatever they know they
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
can paper their wall with the records
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
once they get them um so this even if we
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment it's it really is
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
not it's some deterrence but not a huge
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
deterrence for somebody who really who
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
really wants the records um so yes
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
chair just to your point I that's why I
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't think the Amendments needed
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
because the people that really want the
 
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
record are going to find a way to get
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
around even your Amendment so it just
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
feels like you know in this committee we
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
try not to like put too much detail on
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
91a because we want to leave a lot of it
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
open to interpretation but I feel like
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
when we try to Define things like this
 
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
when we try to Define things like this
like

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
it I I think if somebody wants to get
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
the information they'll find a way to
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
get the information it doesn't matter if
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
you put guard rails on it or
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
not that's that's yes representative
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
H well this is um this issue pertains to
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
both of these bills more to HB 74 but um
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
something you did in HB 66 which I think
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
is good as you crossed out the word
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state and replac it with
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
person but um HB
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
74 tries to come up with the definition
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
of citizen of the state which I guess
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
applies only to 91a and um that's I just
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
think at that moment given what's going
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
on this is more something that's going
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
on you know Nationwide then in
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
Washington DC then conquered um you know
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of uh debate
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
about what who is or is not a citizen of
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
the United States and in state
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
law I looked at all I tried to did like
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
a quick search of the rsas um and
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's lots and lots of references to
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
Citizens most of which don't have uh
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
most of us just use a whatever the
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
commonly accepted V word of and there's
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
some cases uh like with voting you have
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be a citizen of the United States and
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
domas out of New Hampshire to be uh I'm
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if they use the word citizen
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
but for the purpose of voting so I think
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
um I think passing HB 74 in any form at
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
this time is just going to muddy the
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
water especially given like there's a
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
debate over the meaning of the 14th
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment and you know it's not really
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have enough here to worry about it's
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
not really our problem but I I don't
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
think we should uh I don't think we
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
should be redefining citizen just for
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
the sake of the right to no law at this
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
time especially since I'm not really
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
happy with the the definition so you
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
know so so you know what can I just make
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
sure am I understanding Mr uh
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative organ that you would you
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of just 66 without an
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um that too and yes also be
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to just HB 74 there maybe okay
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
there may be some need for Bill I mean
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
what it should say which is what is
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
understood that as a citizen of New
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a citizen of the United
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
States who is a domiciled in New
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's uh that would be
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
probably a good bill that's not really
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's probably not really what we want
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
to do this morning but I would not okay
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
I would not pass this amendment this
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
this change to the law I'm just not
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
oppose I'm just against changing that
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
what's in h74 at all so thanks all right
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so you know what I'm going to
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
recognize representative katab because I
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
think she may have an answer to the
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
question that was asked by
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I do and then after
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask question if I may thank
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so the the definition of
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
media is organizations or individuals
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
who publish information in accepted
 
00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:38.799 align:start position:0%
digital print or broadcast formats into
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
standards generally recognized by
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
professional news organizations that do
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
not serve primarily as a platform to
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
promote the interest Andor opinions of a
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
special interest group government
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
individual or or cause and that came
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
from the definition that the New
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Associated Press uses
 
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.470 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Associated Press uses
essentially

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
um that's that's in the law now that's
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
in the law now 91a 91a um
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
4 ex um I wanted to ask a question if I
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
may sure so if I'm understanding
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
correctly the law this bill would be
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
changing any citizen to any person and
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
so everybody would be able to access
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
information exactly as they are now
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
except it would be any person and the
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
only place that this doic piece would
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
apply to would be to those with this new
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
privilege that we're saying that you can
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
get these records requested
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
electronically and you don't have to go
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
in the into the town hall but it
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be changing anything else that
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
already exists it would only be
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
applicable to this new additional level
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
of transparency that we're adding is
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
that is that understanding correct that
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
no that's correct so just to be very
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
clear if we pass 66 without the
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
amendment anybody body there's no
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
restrict there's no restriction
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatsoever anybody can can request
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
records and get records remotely if we
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
pass 66 with the
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
amendment anybody anywhere will be able
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
to get records by coming to the physical
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
location of the of the office you know
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
where the records are
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
kept but if you're not somebody that has
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
a for lack of a better term a New
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire connection or if you're not
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
somebody that is a member of the media
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
you can't get the records remotely so
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's the and rep represent tur did you
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
question yeah thanks um and and uh it
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's not related to the the topic
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
exactly that we've been talking about
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
this is a question I guess that goes
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
back to the original bill but I didn't
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
have it wasn't able to ask it of you
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
when it was introduced so hopefully it's
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
okay to ask it now um it's in uh in the
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
amendment if we're looking at the
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
amendment it's the the last two lines um
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
at one time it says no charge shall be
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
made for records delivered
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
electronically and then the next line
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
says the sub paragraph does not preclude
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
public body from imposing charges
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
authorized under paragraph 8 my
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of paragraph 8 is it does
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
authorize charges for records um
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
delivered electronically specifically so
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
I I it feels like a conflict I wonder if
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
you could Explain why both of those
 
00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
sentences are sure so you know what I
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
think the key word in here is delivered
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
in other words the I I think the and I
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
think actually this is in there's some
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
reference to this in in 102 I think in
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
other words
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
we we don't if if if if records are
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
simply delivered electronically in other
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
words you you know I the the town sends
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
them out there can be no charge for the
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
delivery of the records as such in other
 
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
delivery of the records as such in other
words

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the town couldn't say well look if
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
we you know if we if we mail these
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
records to you we could charge you the
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
postage for mailing them and the C and a
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
and a charge per page um so we're gonna
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
try to impose some you know uh
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
equivalent charge for the delivery in
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
electronic form but if they meet if it
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements of of uh
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph 8 paragraph 8 that's it's over
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
250 or whatever I I think
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
the the way I would look at that is
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a charge for the delivery of
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
the records it's a charge for having to
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
assemble them and redact them and the
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
time that's involved and it and yes it's
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
on a per page kind of thing but it's
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
really sort of it's not so much that I'm
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
pressing the button and sending it to
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
you electronically it's the time that
 
00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
you electronically it's the time that
the

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
town has to uh has to invol be involved
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
in doing
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
this so that that's I would guess so I
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
guess the question I'm sorry
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Manos please so I I mean
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I the question
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
is as I said before I can live with
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
either of these and again let me let me
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
let me just raise one other thing that I
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
think again this is what our caucus had
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
discussed and I think it actually might
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
be a decent
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
strategy what we had suggested is let's
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
pass 66 with without the
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and with regard to
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
74 which has some language about you
 
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.309 align:start position:0%
74 which has some language about you
know

00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
restricting uh uh some language about
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
you have to be a a citizen that kind of
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
thing let's retain
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
that let's not do anything with that
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
now if this bill passes the floor which
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
I think it would without the amendment I
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
think it would I'm not saying there
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be some fight over it there
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
might you know it might be some of
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
objection but I think 66 would pass the
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
real issue is what happens when it goes
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
to the other body there I think there
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
might be um more push back um and so we
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
would if it came back and there was some
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
changes that we didn't like we would
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
still have S 74 that you know we we
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
could we could do something with make
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate changes to maybe address um
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
if what what the Senate might have done
 
00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:28.510 align:start position:0%
if what what the Senate might have done
um

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
so you know I guess I'm I'm wondering
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
what what do people think about that
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
strategy we passed 66 we retain
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
74 yes representative mcfar so I I think
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
first of all I would say that um I hope
 
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
that we would all support 66 with or
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
without the amendment uh when I consider
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
the question of is it better with the
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
amendment and your parade of Ables
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
around the uh pajama clad chinan my
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
concern is less
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
around a single request and more around
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody like that were to make
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of requests and I think for
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
that reason and also in the spirit of
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
the right to know uh Law's original
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
intent I'm supportive of the amendment
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
um but I I wonder whether it would be
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
worth taking uh a a feel of the room
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah for for with and without and and
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say is in just
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
the same way as you're saying Bob that
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
if we were to uh recommend 66 without
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
the amendment to to the house floor uh
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
we could still Rectify it with 74 I
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
think the same would hold true with the
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
amendment sure no that's true that's
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
true so you know I'm sorry uh
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative buron and then
 
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.789 align:start position:0%
representative buron and then
representative

00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr thank you Mr chair I
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
was curious to M did municipalities ever
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
sort of um like for example this might
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
require a little training for most
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities as far as you know what's
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
legal what's not so I'm curious have we
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
ever gotten pushed back from changes
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
like this because I don't know if
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're going have to pay for train oh
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes we have but so just for those for
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
those of you who are new let let let me
 
00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:21.950 align:start position:0%
those of you who are new let let let me
just

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
spend a brief we
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
had we we had a huge fight last year um
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
and it was a bipartisan fight there were
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats on both sides
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
of this issue about charging fees for
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
requests um and um it it went you know
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
we we initially passed it then um it
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
there was a a request to recommit it to
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
the committee it came back to the
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
committee um I and I forgot what we were
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to do when it came back but
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
fortunately representative katab and a
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
former member of this committee uh
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny um came up with a
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
with a with what is now uh in in law
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
that representative kutab was just
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
referring to that
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
allows um uh charging for in really a
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
very limited category of of of uh
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
Records email Communications if they
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
exceed 250 in a month one month period
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
isn't it yeah so it's a very limited uh
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
number of uh Records that for which
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
charges can be made but um that's what
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
we passed so it was there was a huge
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
issue because I I mean and I think I not
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
unfairly summarizing many municipalities
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
wanted the ability to charge because
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
their position is it takes a lot of time
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
and a lot of work to gather these
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
records and
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know why should the taxpayers have
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
to pay when somebody makes these these
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
really big requests on the other side
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
there were people who felt and I
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
completely understand
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
this they're public records and you know
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
where people should be able to get their
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
records and they shouldn't have to pay
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
anything and it was a huge fight so um
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
that's I mean
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's it it that is that has been a big
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
issue so but I think um representative
 
01:00:25.559 --> 01:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
issue so but I think um representative
Smith

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation if I
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
could also add one other Factor uh the
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in New Hamshire um
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
belong to um the municipal Association
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
they pay a significant fee uh each of
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
them to have the municipal
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
Association uh pay attention to what
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing here um try to guide what we
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
do and you've seen evidence of that but
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
also provide training um um to uh and
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
and be a source of information to all
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns to help make sure
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
that they have all the information they
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
need to comply with the law of the state
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
and that is something that they do and
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
they've done it for many years and so
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns are not left out
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
there to dry on their own and expect you
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
know the little town the little poor
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
little town of durm for example to know
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
about change in laws I mean there are
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
resources available
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
to so you know can I just ask I think
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland had a good can
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
I just ask can I get just a sense how
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
how many people would be comfortable
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
with passing 66 without the amendment
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
and then retaining 74 can I just ask you
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
if you're comfortable with that Pat
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
hand okay you PR prefer Okay so what are
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
we got so I'm sorry can I can I ask you
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand against just so I can
 
01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand against just so I can
count

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
count
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
yeah this no no no I'm this is this is
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
not gonna this is not a vote that counts
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get a sense so one
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
two three four five six seven eight 9 10
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
11 so uh 12 12 all right the sense is
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
just to pass 66 to just past 66 right
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
all right so so there was 12 now how
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
many would oppose passing 66
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
without any Amendment so one two three
 
01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:34.510 align:start position:0%
without any Amendment so one two three
all

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
right right
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
right yeah how many folks would prefer
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
how many folks would would vote in favor
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
of Passage with the amendment that's
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
yeah all right that's right how many
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
people would favor passage with the
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that's so you have to have the
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire conne passage or vote
 
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.990 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire conne passage or vote
passage

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
passage
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
what what how many
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
let me start again how many people would
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
vote for passage of 66 without the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
amendment if you would raise your
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
hand so what do we got one two three
 
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
hand so what do we got one two three
four

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
five five six 78 nine so it looks like
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
nine how many people would vote for 66
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's slightly more people
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
that would favor the
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um all right so what I'm going
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
to do then is um I will move Amendment
 
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.630 align:start position:0%
to do then is um I will move Amendment
2025

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
that was a representative trip second
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
all right Mr yes yes representative
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
Smith Mr chair I had prepared an
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
66 that addresses a number of the issues
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
that have been of concern to the
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee but listening to the
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
discussion up until now and respecting
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
the disperate views I do not plan to
 
01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:56.309 align:start position:0%
the disperate views I do not plan to
submit

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
that Amendment uh because I believe that
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
the approach that's taken under the
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
amendment now before our
 
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.269 align:start position:0%
amendment now before our
consideration

01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
um attempts to
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
address the key issues but does
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
not get hung up in the weeds and my
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment had more detail and in the
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
fullness of time we might want to get to
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
more detail but not right now thank you
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
all right so anyone else have anything
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
they want to say on the amendment yes
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get to speak earlier and I
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
was seeking recognition so I want to
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
make some broader points if I can have
 
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
some latitude to do that please um I
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
agree with your changes to the
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
definition of person so I agree with
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
that part of it but I have severe
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
reservations about um
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
66 I my reservations are that the
 
01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
66 I my reservations are that the
concept

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the town or the municipality or the
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
city having to produce the records on
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
the expectation that the person in China
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
will show up and actually collect the
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
records still
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
requires an expenditure of time energy
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
effort expense by the town and municipal
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
it or city and um I have severe
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
reservations about that I also um don't
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't can't support the concept of there
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
being a two-
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
tiered process here if the records are
 
01:06:44.359 --> 01:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
tiered process here if the records are
available

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
electronically then then you have to be
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
have a if I'm understanding this
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
correctly and and correct me if I'm
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
wrong if you have a relationship with
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
the state the and the records are
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
available in electronic form then you
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
get them but if you don't have a
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state or the
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
records are not available in electronic
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
form then you have to show up to collect
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
them am I understanding that correct I
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
think that oversimplifies it a little
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
bit if the uh so I if what if the you're
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
right about the connection with the
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
state or not connction so let me let me
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
try to restate it if
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
you want to get records whether they're
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
electronic or not if you want to get
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
records and you are willing to come to
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
the town to get them you can get anyone
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
can get the records including the person
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
in China if they want to come to plastal
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know to get the records whether the
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
records are kept electronically or not
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
they can get the records if they're kept
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
electronically the town can provide them
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
electronically or the town can provide
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
them in paper copies but the person can
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
get the record if you want if if you're
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
um not someone that has a connection
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire under under the amend
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
then you can't request the records
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
remotely you can't in other words you if
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want to come to New Hampshire
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
you can't get the records whether
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
they're kep kept remotely I mean whether
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're kept electronically or not you
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
have to um but if if you have a
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
connection with New Hampshire then you
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
can request the records remotely and you
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
can ask for the way that they'll be
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
provided I mean you if if they have they
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
have them an electronic format you can
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
get them electronically anyway it it
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
creates a two-tier system and I'm not
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of that and particularly
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
given that the town Municipality of City
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
would have to EXP spend the time and
 
01:08:58.349 --> 01:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
energy to produce the records not
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
knowing whether the person is going to
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
show up to collect them or not or that
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
there is that there's any likelihood a
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
strong likelihood that they would show
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
up what I would suggest on this and I
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
also had an amendment on 74 I prefer
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
74 um and what I would suggest is that
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
rather retaining rather than retaining
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
66 rather than passing 66 and retaining
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
70 before I would urge that we set up a
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
working group which I would be happy to
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
to participate in to see if we can um
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh to for us to work on both of these
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
bills and see if we can come to
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
consensus and come to one bill that we
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
can um support uh as a committee and
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
send on to the
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
floor anyone else so um yes uh
 
01:09:54.679 --> 01:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
floor anyone else so um yes uh
representative

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
I like that idea um I'm new to this
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee but in my committee when we've
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
discussed a bill for I don't know 45
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
minutes it's pretty obvious that the
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
Bill's not quite ready for prime time
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
and I think that looking at it as a
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then coming back with
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
something that you can present to the
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
floor with a very strong vote is a good
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
idea anyone else wish to be
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
heard yes representative Anders thank
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh as far as the amendment
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
goes is it
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional part one article 8 of The
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution talks about people having
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
access and in there there's the word
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
public is everybody the public all over
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
the world I mean in while we TR going
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
against it and as far as 66 and 74 I am
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
in favor retaining them because I think
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
we need to F tune both of them
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
representative

01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
Perez I think we should
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
leave I think we shouldn't deal with
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
these the we
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
passed went through hell to pass 91a and
 
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you quite honestly the
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
only reason why I voted in favor of it
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
on the floor is because the Senate bill
 
01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
on the floor is because the Senate bill
was

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
worse I we spent forever I think there's
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
problems with it I still believe that
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
people should not be charged for but
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's my personal belief we don't know
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
what the Senate's coming up with I don't
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
think we should be passing either of
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
these I think you know we want to let
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
the ab budsman have another two years to
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
work maybe we need to let the 91a that
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
we voted in at least have a year to work
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
I mean when did we vote it in it hasn't
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
even been a year
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
yet yeah so all so you know here's I
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
guess I I think it's kind of important
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
to to understand this this
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
whole citizen thing this citizen uh
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue which this is one of that's one of
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
the things this is designed to
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
correct that came up really in one case
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
and and as the superior Court's decision
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
sort of pointed out um
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
there the idea that by changing this to
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
any person we're sort of you know
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
really making this big expansion I know
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
that the you know some of the
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have expressed real
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
concern about this but other than this
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
one case as far as we know there was
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
never any issue raised when out of state
 
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.590 align:start position:0%
never any issue raised when out of state
um

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh entities had requested information um
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
or I guess even when out of apparently
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
even when somebody from Argentina
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
requested information there had never
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
been any issues
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
until this one uh Town decided that
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
because a newspaper reporter who lived
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
in Maine but was reporting on you know
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
was was reporting on New Hampshire on
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire town because they
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
could try to you know prevent that
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
person from getting records which I I
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to say it seems completely
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
outrageous to me only because that that
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
came up was this whole issue raised so I
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
I really do think it's it's important to
 
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
I really do think it's it's important to
emphasize

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
emphasize
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
that as a practical matter although yes
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
there are the you know that guy in China
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
in his pajamas I suppose you know this
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
would sort of explicitly allow that
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
whereas right now you have the
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship somebody could make an
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
argument on that it I don't think it's
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
much of a real issue and the other point
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
that I agree with representative Perez
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
on is it's really important to
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand this whole area has been
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
looked at we spent a lot of time on it
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
last year and I with deference to people
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
who have suggested this I my sense is if
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
we put this off uh you know to look at
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
it for we're going to be back with the
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
same kind of things you know a month
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
from now or whatever and we got a lot of
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
bills in this committee so I would tend
 
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.629 align:start position:0%
bills in this committee so I would tend
to

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
say let's let's vote on this now now
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's that would be my sense so um with
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to uh uh I'm going to
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
I've moved the amendment it's been
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
seconded and um I'm going to press for a
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment does um anybody
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
else want to speak to the amendment
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative Smith the
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
only uh comment I want to make to my
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
colleague is that 91a has been the law
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
for quite a while I think what you meant
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
is the latest um iteration so we've been
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
struggling with this since time in
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
Memorial and it's never been
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
easy thank and I know you know that
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative anyone yes representative
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
mcfar I I would just say to those who
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
are uh on the fence on voting for the
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and to the Constitutional
 
01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
question that was
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
raised it seems to me that the language
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
amendment is a far closer match to my
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the public and people
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
who are choosing to be part of our
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
social contract uh here in in New
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and in in the government of
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh than uh the current
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
language with the concerns that Bob
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
raised around Citizen and and you know
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
the the the ultimate necessity of
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
considering how to define that so uh
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
when when you read in the Constitution
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
where it says the public I put it to you
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
that that does not include the uh the
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
person who lives in Argentina is
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
domiciled has citizenship in Argentina
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and has no Nexus to New Hampshire
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever all right anyone else all
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
right so the the the uh the motion
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
before us is on um ought to pass
 
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
before us is on um ought to pass

meeting only a physical presence is
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
unavoidable and requiring physical
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
presence for voting chair recognizes uh
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%

this bill is is really workable the
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%

01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
prevent what does it mean
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is an example of
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
to understand once again that life is
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
not perfect and uh and we are not really
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
able to resolve this problem with this
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm sorry you know was there
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
a second to the to the
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
motion second by representative Oregon
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
all right so no I'm sorry that's all
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
right um all right um all right anyone
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
else uh wish to wish to speak to yes
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative or um well we had a
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
straford county budget meeting um rep I
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
was President Reverend Smith had an
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
excused absence and we had a member um
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
we actually had a somewhat ironic thing
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
we had a member who was out of state for
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
reasons that are unavoidable it was
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
family business required her to be about
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
1,500 miles away and she
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately tried to zoom into the
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
meeting but was unable to because the uh
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
person who was operating the waiting
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
room forgot to no she's in the waiting
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
room which is not really an argument for
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
against this pill but it just shows uh
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
you just shows that Zoom is an important
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh important way of extending people's
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
access to the meeting because otherwise
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
that member would have been totally un
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't even had a chance to
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
attend the meeting so I mean so
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly um or public bodies when they
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
use zoom for voting like you know have
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure it works right it's still a
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
new thing but uh yeah I think uh but I
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
think I think um you know we we should
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
be they should be allowed to use zoom so
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
I think I think what we have is not
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
perfect but it's working pretty well
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
though not necessarily well last night
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
and I add all the all the votes we took
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
were unanimous anyway so it didn't
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
affect the result of the vote the
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem we had all right uh
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you I noticed
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
when you talked you used the term
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
unavoidable when you talked about a
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
person being out of state I think the
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
term unavoidable is much more easily
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
defined than not reasonably practical so
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
so I really think that
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
unavoidable has a definite definition as
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
a word if you look it up in the
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
dictionary but not reasonably practical
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
does not have a definition so as far as
 
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.830 align:start position:0%
does not have a definition so as far as
the

01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
voting I agree that you should have to
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
be present to a vot to vote but you know
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
I would let that go but changing the
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
wording to me is very very important
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
so other yes representative trip the uh
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
main issue I have with this bill is uh
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
it applies to every public body and uh
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is painting with a
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
broad you know brush that uh was will
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
have unintended
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
consequences other yes representative
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
kop well I do agree that the term
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
unavoidable would probably be much more
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
easily understood by the public my real
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is that while
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's not allowing somebody to vote it is
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
allowing them to count towards the
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
Quorum of the body and we need to
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
remember that again this is where the
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
broad brush applies to every body and
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few towns where their
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
bodies are only three member bodies and
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
so essentially what this would mean is
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
that if one person happens to be absent
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
one is present at the location and one
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
is on the phone then that means then the
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
person that's present at the location
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that one person will be the sole
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
deciding person on everything and the
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
person on the phone I mean you might as
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
well just say it's not an emergency
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
meeting you can't have the meeting it
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
just it doesn't make sense to allow one
 
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
person to make a decision on everybody's
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
behalf representative Alexander thank
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I I agree with
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative cab I would be in favor
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill if we scratch section two
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
and just renumber it and add just do the
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
change of not reasonably practical to
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
unavoidable so my position on the floor
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass with an amendment
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
that would just drop section two um for
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
the purposes of voting but I think there
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
is some merit with changing not
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical to unavoidable all
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
right other anyone else yes thank you Mr
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um so as many of you may or may
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
not know I've been on the board of
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
education in Nashville for quite some
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
time in my first two years on the board
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
we had a gentleman Mr moer um who had
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
suffered a stroke um his attendance for
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
two years we voted all the time was to
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
be via the phone he didn't count towards
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
the Quorum um and he probably could have
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
made it in if someone had picked him up
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
at his house and driven it wasn't
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
unavoidable for him not to go but it was
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
really inconvenient and while he was
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
mentally extremely fit physically he was
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
not and the process of getting into
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
someone else's car and then having to
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
walk into the building and walk down the
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
slope and sit in the the you with the
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
rest of us was difficult for him I I
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
would hate to see someone like a Mr moer
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
miss his chance to participate in the
 
01:27:38.189 --> 01:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
process after having been elected um
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
because of a change in wording like this
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
I could certainly see someone arguing
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that it is not unavoidable he should
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
just use his walker and come to the
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
meetings um and I can tell you as a new
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
member you know eight years ago hearing
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
from someone who had been on the board
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
for 20 years about how things had been
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
done about his thoughts on pretty much
 
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
every topic that we discussed was
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful and I again I would
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
hate to see a change like this have an
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of taking someone
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
who has something that isn't practical
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
for them to come but is probably
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
avoidable thank you anyone else wish to
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
be heard so I guess what yes
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative HG well I'll just respond
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
to the uh point to General Le he made
 
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
which I did use the word unavoidable I
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
was not trying to imply that I thought
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
that was a better language than not
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical in either case um
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
when a member of you know of any public
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
body wishes to use that remote option I
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
think we should respect their reasons
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
for doing so so she would not second
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
guess second uh should not be second
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
guessing them so if somebody says it's
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
not reasonably practical uh unless
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
they're very grossly abusing it um we
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
should respect the fact that it's not
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical and if we change it
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
unavoidable there'll still be the same
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
thing we still have to respect their
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
reasons for thinking it was unavoidable
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
for them to show up and you know there
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
may be some cases where theoretically in
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
fact that was like the dispute that
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
prompted this Builder so like
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically the member who
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
participated by Zoom
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically could have could have like
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
driven a very long distance to get here
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
and back but it was better for him not
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
to and I I respect I respect that
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
particular member's decision certainly
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
in any case almost every case it's it's
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
preferable to have a member
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
participating remotely and voting and
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
joining discussion than in not having
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
them there at all sure it's better it's
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
nice to have them there in person but if
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
they can't make it in person but they're
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
still ready to address the issues um
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
that's better than just having them sit
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
at home and not be able to do anything
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
about it at all so
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
thanks right anyone else wish should be
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
heard so I guess I'm I'm persuaded to
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this for one basic reason it
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me this really is a matter of
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
local control I mean it may if if local
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
boards as as representative trip uh I
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
think Point points out this this would
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
apply everywhere and it seems to me if
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
local boards don't want to do if they
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
want to have if they want assisted
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
people be there you know you have you
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
can't come remotely they can do that
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
nothing prevents them from doing that if
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
they want to make say you know you have
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
to if you want to vote you have to be
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
there they can do that but I it just
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
seems to me why you know what's
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
the what's the interest in that the fact
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
that you know the with great respect for
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill who I have the
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for but you know the fact
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
you the the vote sort of didn't go your
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
way I mean the you know your desire to
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
have the the system work in a certain
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
way in your locality and you lose the
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
vote on that that's you know that's what
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
democracy is about so I guess I I'm I'm
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
persuaded to to support the itl motion
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone wishes to
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
say all right I guess we're ready for um
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%

01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
motion I move on to pass J second
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
second moved by representative katab
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Smith uh
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative kab do you speak to your
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
motion uh no I think this is just uh
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
sure real quick I guess because there's
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
Subs here just to explain this is just a
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
really simple Bill to add in the start
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
and end times and the the name of the
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
person doing the minutes the reason why
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
is because this has been challenged that
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
these were not official minutes and so I
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
identify who was taking the minutes so
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
that people know that they were in fact
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
official minutes thank
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%

by representative uh Smith
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh Smith uh representative tur would you
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion sure
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
briefly um I think we've already talked
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
about all the um efforts and discussions
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
and time that went into crafting house
 
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
build 102 in the last session um it's a
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
relatively new change to the law we're
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
still looking at the impacts of that um
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
this essentially rolls back all that
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
effort um and uh I don't feel that
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate uh given given the
 
01:36:43.629 --> 01:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
the combination of effort and and lack
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
of experience with the with the new rule
 
01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
of experience with the with the new rule
all

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
right representative Andress do you wish
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
to uh to speak on this I I I know I know
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
that technically your amendment is not
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
before us but I think In fairness I we
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
it it it I think it goes your
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
your your this is your bill and I think
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment it sort of goes to what
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're discussing so I'd like to hear
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
what you have to say about it so should
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
I introduce the amendment now or I don't
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
think we should introduce the amendment
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
now but you can certainly talk about
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
talk about if we if we ever got to that
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment what it would say all
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
right the only reason I am against the
 
01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.550 align:start position:0%
right the only reason I am against the
current

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
law last year I realized there was much
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
work but this was all about a few places
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
like one was Rochester one was down in
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
some other part of the Southern
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
State and the
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
average every day citizen in the state
 
01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was not considered
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
whether any one of us like it or not
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
there are people that have a right to
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
know about their
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
government and they do not have the
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
money and they may have to ask for a lot
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
of information but they don't have the
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
money to pay and this bill the current
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
law should be done away
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
with I had an amendment and what it was
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
is to put the liability back in the bill
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
because I gave it that a lot of thought
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as municipalities go and even
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
school districts because I've had a lot
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
to do with them I don't think anybody
 
01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.669 align:start position:0%
to do with them I don't think anybody
would

01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:36.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
honestly cheat and not give you the
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
information that you asked
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
for but again we live in a live free a
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
die State and yet what I find the law
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
that took effect last
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
year is taking away the people's rights
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire thank you
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative tur uh just want one
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
clarification there were a few very
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
high-profile issues of uh very broad uh
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
right to know requests um that that
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
became publicized the issue I think was
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
a lot more widespread than that I know
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
it was an issue in my community ones
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
around mine um and um you know there
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
were provisions put in to protect people
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
unable to pay um so I I just didn't want
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
to characterize it as as as a change
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
that was made without um a a lot of um
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
input from places that that were
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing these problems and it was
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
made to really protect the right to no
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
law from uh the abuses that were taking
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
place all right um yes representative
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
Perez I just want to reiterate I only
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
voted for it I did not want charges I
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
only voted in favor of it because the
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
Senate bill was
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
worse anyone else so I guess what I
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
would say is that oh I'm sorry
 
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
would say is that oh I'm sorry
representative

01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
McFarland I I'm in favor of both the
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and the amendment
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
however I would ask Mr chairman if we
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
could perhaps get the the the sense of
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
um the uh representative Andress
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
introducing the amendment here um with
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
regard to the desire to strike from the
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
original Bill
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
language um sorry let me rephrase in the
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
original Bill language we strike
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
paragraphs E and
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
F and in the amended language we only
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
strike in that section
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
e it's not clear to me why we need to
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
strike e at all I understand that we're
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
changing uh the statute if we adopt this
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that there is no cost or fee to the
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.750 align:start position:0%
so that there is no cost or fee to the
request

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
but there is a cost to the agency the
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
town you know the government entity and
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
I don't find it
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
unreasonable that a town might say hey
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
you've asked for XYZ could you maybe
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
accept x y and B uh and that would save
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
us us funds and I suspect that many
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers making such a request would be
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
happy to acceed to that so is there a
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
particular reason why we need to strike
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph e i i that's a that's I guess
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's really a question to you
 
01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
that's really a question to you
representative

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
Andrew I'm not sure how to answer it so
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to right so so here's you
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
know here here's what I guess as my sort
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
of opportunity to speak on this I really
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
think and I would urge the committee to
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion on this and for
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
this reason as I said
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
before this with or without the
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
amendment this bill effectively would
 
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
repeal uh house bill one2 from a year
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
ago that as I indicated this was the
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
subject of great contention in the house
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
and the senate representative uh katab
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
and rep former representative Kenny were
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
able to come up with uh an amendment
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that you know it was a classic
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that both sides of the issue
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
were you know had some unhappiness with
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
um as representative Perez says you know
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
she sort of voted for it because the
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
what was what the Senate was proposing
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
to do would have been worse um I frankly
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
was on the other side of that issue from
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative perz I would have imposed
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
I would have wanted to impose uh give
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
towns the ability to impose costs in
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
more situations um but it was a you know
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was a compromise that we worked out
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that I think is
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
really really important to understand is
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard in
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
this the current law says that even the
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
the very small ability to recover fee
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
recover costs if you have over 250
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
emails in uh uh in a month if you're
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
requesting that can only be done by a
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
municipality or the state I guess but it
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
can only be done if you've adopted
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines or policies to to to allow
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
you to do that the testimony we heard
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
was that no municipalities had done that
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
so no Municipal you know so the idea
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
that municipalities are are improperly
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
charging people for uh fees to to uh
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
even Under The Limited ability they have
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
it it's not happening I mean we didn't
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
hear any evidence suggesting that you
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
know this this person was charged some
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
outrageous amount of money for E for
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
because they asked for too many emails
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
so I urge you
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
this the we we spent a great deal of
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
time last year arriving at a
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
compromise the compromise Ser the
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
compromise you know everybody had to
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
swallow hard but we did it um and it
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
certainly hasn't been in effect the the
 
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
the current law certainly hasn't been in
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
effect long enough that we can say well
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
working because no nobody really I mean
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's having even as a practical matter
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
it hasn't even really been implemented
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
because towns haven't adopted the
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines so right now they're not
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
charging so for all those reasons I urge
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
itl anyone
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
else all right um I guess we're ready
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
for uh a vote the motion is uh on hb14
 
01:44:52.599 --> 01:44:53.629 align:start position:0%
for uh a vote the motion is uh on hb14

Bill uh 376 specifying that Library user
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
information exempt from disclosure under
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%

second all right seconded by

representative Perez uh representative
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
Alexander do you wish to speak to your
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
motion yes briefly it's very important
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
libraries serve as vital Community
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
Resources providing access to
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
information in a safe and private
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
environment however under current
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
interpretations of RSA 91a library card
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
holder information could be made
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible which raises serious
 
01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.669 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible which raises serious
privacy

01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
concerns library cards are personal
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
tools used to borrow books and access
 
01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
services details that should not be
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
subject to public scrutiny the language
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
in HB 376 is clarifying language so that
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
the release of library card user
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
information is clearly in violation of
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a releasing such information
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
undermines an individual's right to
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
privacy and could discourage people from
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
using libraries altogether moreover
 
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
libraries are trusted to safeguard
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
personal data and releasing this
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
information would be violation of that
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
trust exempting library card records
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
from Public Access aligns with privacy
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
protections found in other sectors
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring libraries remain safe spaces
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
where individuals can explore knowledge
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
without fear of exposure right to know
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire supports this clarifying
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
language please vote for it thank
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative pno
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative Perez you wish to speak
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes very briefly because
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
we did talk about this we're talking
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
about children we're talking about
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 we're
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
talking about their safety we're talking
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
about parents who can't
 
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
get find out what books their children
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
are taking out but yet if the book is
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
lost or it's late they have to be
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
responsible without knowing what they're
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
paying for for paying for
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
this I think it's a common sense thing I
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
think you know as much as you want to
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
might want to say that they have a right
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
to privacy under the age of 18 yes they
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
have a right to privacy for some things
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
but certainly not on material these kids
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
can get this information on the
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
internet there's no reason why the
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
parents can't know what books they're
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
trying to take out of the library it's
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
common sense I believe it's a parent
 
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
right and I hope that you will pass it
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
on uh rep house on a motion of V to pass
 
01:52:08.669 --> 01:52:08.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes please thank you
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um so this bill randomly
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
went to Child and Family Law last
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
session and child and family law uh
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
recommended against passage and we
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
recommended against passage last year
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
for a couple of different reasons um
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
first if a parent wants to have
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to the records of
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
their child the solution already exists
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
you simply have the child use the
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
parents library card which they are able
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
to do until they are 18 so that would
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
allow the parent to see everything that
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
their child has checked out and have all
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
that information Our concern about a
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
parent getting access to the child's
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
Library Records Was regarding a lot of
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
thorny child custody and child abuse
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
things that libraries aren't prepared to
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
track so this bill kind of addresses it
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I appreciated that because it says
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
if the parent has the same license
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
address as the child however we know in
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
child and family law that
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
frequently people move in and out of
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
households and no one ever updates their
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
library card address so it is very
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
possible that there will be situations
 
01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:24.679 align:start position:0%
where a parent has a court order saying
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
that they do not have rights to
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
information about this child due to
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
their own behavior but their physical
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
license might still match and that might
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
still match overlap for years not just
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
days so again I think that this is a
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem and if
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
parents want to know what their kids are
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
reading in the public library the
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
solution is to use one library card that
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
is in the parents name and we had dozens
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
of librarians from across the state
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
testify that in fact that is a practice
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
that happens in all of the libraries in
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know at this point I'm
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
going to take a brief recess and call a
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh Republican caucus uh for five
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
recess

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.320 --> 01:55:21.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.239 --> 01:56:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to re uh reopen the executive
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
session we're on uh House Bill uh
 
01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:03.109 align:start position:0%
session we're on uh House Bill uh
273

01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
273
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
um the motion is ought to pass anybody
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on uh the motion
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass yes
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative um I spoke at the hearing
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
when this bill came up and I stand by
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
those comments
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
um yes we're talking about children but
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
children don't always live at the same
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
dress as their parents they children are
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
in foster care children live with
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
boyfriends children are homeless so just
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
because the person in front of me says
 
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
says that he lives at a certain address
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
which really should be verified in some
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
way that's not um defined in this bill
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
is does not mean that the children live
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
at that same address um and to expect a
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
library staff member to have that
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
information at their finger tips is is
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
expecting way too much right anyone else
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard on yes representative
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
pno thank you chairman Lynn um I spoke
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
with or received an email from um former
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative arene corello who spoke
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
here and she's a librarian and she said
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
that she linked Accounts at the Raymond
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
library but it didn't give her the
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
ability to tell parents what books their
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
kids had out it just allowed all family
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
accounts to appear appear on one
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
computer screen which made checking
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
books in and out quicker and easier
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
linking accounts was done by request
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
only only from parents it didn't just
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
happened automatically and in the end it
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
didn't bypass the current state
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
law and I also this just seems to be um
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
a fundamental right and Duty and
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
obligation of parents to be able to
 
01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
manage the books that their children
 
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
have out of the libr out from the
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
library anyone else wish to be heard um
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
I I have to say I'm I I intend to
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
support this it it it really seems to me
 
01:59:00.750 --> 01:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
that this is just you know one more
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
indication of uh of uh entities of
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
government and particularly troubling to
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
me is schools are basically you know
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
cutting the parents out of the uh of uh
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
of having information that they it
 
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
fundamentally should should be available
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
to them so I intend to support the OTP
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
motion anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative Perez just a quick thing
 
01:59:32.069 --> 01:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
we had a very and there's many of them
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
but a very unfortunate thing we had an
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
extremely suicidal Middle School
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
depressed suicidal parents were doing
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
everything they could everything they
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
could and that child was encouraged to
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
take out a book about the pros and cons
 
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.950 align:start position:0%
take out a book about the pros and cons
of

01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
suicide their parent that parent had no
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
right to know about that but fortunately
 
01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:57.990 align:start position:0%
right to know about that but fortunately
the

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
child brought it to the parents this
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
type of inappropriate thing can happen
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to know what as
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
books are being given to their children
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
or taken out of a library by their
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
children anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent representative bur thank
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
you as many of you know I I'm on the
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
board of the Manchester School District
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
so I've always felt like our students
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to have access to the
 
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
library without their parents knowledge
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
just on certain books in the event that
 
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
they're actually looking into a topic
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
that they can't speak to their parents
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
about or Guardian whatnot so after
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
talking to many students I'm saying to
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
myself they deserve the Privacy right
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on uh HB uh
 
02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.270 align:start position:0%

to get us uh as much work out of the way
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%

I'm not going to try to have a uh I I'm
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
sure there will be significant uh
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
disagreement on hp19 on the F statute
 
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:35.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
the board of tax and land appeals uh if
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
you if you haven't had enough time I'm
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
not going to say we have to do it but if
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
it okay all right um we've taken we've
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%

sure you get back to me with if you if
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
you agree on that report um rep uh what
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
about HB
 
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
369 um that's the sexual assault uh
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
changing the process for sexual assault
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor cases um again I'm not going
 
02:04:44.589 --> 02:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
to I Just Want to Have a brief
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion rather than rather than
 
02:04:49.709 --> 02:04:49.719 align:start position:0%
taking a vote yet but um representative
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
kutab can you just tell us you have a
 
02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:54.679 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment um which I guess I'm
 
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think I've passed out yet
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
un unless you are passing passing that
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
way all right coming this way all right
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
so there so this amendment just simply
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
corrects the issue that we heard
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday it's saying a victim less than
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
18 years of age in both places at the
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
time that the prosecution is commenced I
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
did also run this by the prosecutor that
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
was here yesterday he was happy with
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
this language he felt like it should be
 
02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
consistent in both places and has less
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
than instead of years or less that might
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
become ambiguous or argued later so this
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
is just
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
simply changing it from um 16 to 18
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
there because keeping in mind too that
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
that will mean essentially that
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's 17 if you're less than 18 all
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
right so um I guess I'm just wondering
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
where I mean I'm I personally I'm fine
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and personally I
 
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
um prepared to uh EXA the bill and vote
 
02:05:57.159 --> 02:05:57.910 align:start position:0%
um prepared to uh EXA the bill and vote
uh

02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
otpa um where where are people where are
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
people on it I personally fine with the
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment ATA but obviously I had no
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
reason to call my Fus
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
so I need to it can be done openly now I
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't care but I need to know how people
 
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
feel so I would appreciate a straw vote
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sure so and again I you know
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
if anyone I I don't want to sort of in
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
any way ramrod anyone into uh you know
 
02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
voting if you're uncomfortable but I I'm
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
wondering could I just ask for a straw a
 
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
show of hands for a straw vote if the if
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
the motion was
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
otpa with representative kab's Amendment
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
um who would if you raise your hand if
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
that any uh representative fing you're
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
the appears you're I would support the
 
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I personally would like more
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
time to understand the underlying Bill
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
I've listened to the testimony uh but I
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
haven't reviewed the rsas it relates to
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
