00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
362 uh granting the Department of
 
00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
Education rule making authority to
 
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%

scores on professional education um
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
title um uh this is Representatives Lads
 
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
Bill and he's here and um this is
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
actually uh representative lad day in
 
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
terms of hearings yeah um he wasn't
 
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
doing anything else today so we figured
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
we'd give him something to
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
do um so welcome uh representative lad
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and we are interested in hearing
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
about HB
 
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 align:start position:0%
362 well thank you very much uh
 
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli chair cordelli
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the education policy
 
00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
committee whatever you want
 
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
Administration what you want to call it
 
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
um this chair is a big chair you know
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
you can get lost in this thing and your
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
wings have to be that wide to move it
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
around there's all I put two of us in it
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today to introduce I guess
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the the concept that we have
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
in in front of us this is HB
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
362 and apparently there was a you know
 
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
a parallel situation or a parallel
 
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
universe over at legislative Services
 
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
the day that representative cordelli put
 
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
his in I put mine and um they're danal
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and so I do not want to go through
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
and rehearse all this for you again but
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
just giving you rather than walking
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
through that bill because it's a very
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
short bill um this is an area that we
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm talking we as a legislature have
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
always been very um cautious of our lure
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
in this state in terms of that the bar
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
due to what covid or years before
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
anything else is going on doesn't lessen
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
we still want our our our folks in the
 
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms teaching based upon a certain
 
00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 align:start position:0%
standard that our state board of
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
education has adopted and
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
approved and that's basically the
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
concept behind this whole thing here we
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
do not want as some states are now
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
doing they're lessening the requirements
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
to become a licensed
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
educator that puts up red flags for me
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh I was in my previous life a fourth
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
grade teacher after I came out of the
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
service there was this young Lieutenant
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
that came out and said I need to get a
 
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
job and I love working with people I had
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
worked at Maine Military Academy as an
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
instructor there and seen it all
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
overseas um so I got in that business
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
and I saw the professionalism of
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
teachers in the
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
classroom and then following that I got
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
in into school principal ship and
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
supervising what I saw in classes in
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction ction and
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
stayed with that the rest of my working
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
life and ended up in Alaska where I was
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
at the Distinguished Principal that year
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
for the entire State and the reason why
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
I see this as an important bill is that
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
we do need to maintain our standards in
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to maintain New
 
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.790 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to maintain New
Hampshire

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
standards and for lure and when I see
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
what's being tried down in New Jersey
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
when I see what's being proposed in the
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
state of Maine are neighbors and when I
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
started out in the business of Education
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
the university Maine and University of
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire worked collaboratively
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
together Maine did not have a physical
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
therapy program yet UNH did so we had
 
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 align:start position:0%
people going back and forth where the
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
programs were and so but the standards
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
which this state has are no longer the
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
same as what Mains ours are higher and
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be there and that's
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
because the we we're when you look at
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
our achievement scores in this country
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
where does the where do state of New
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really Stack Up in proportion
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we're perfect we have a
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
long way to go in mathematics and some
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
of those basic subject areas but we're
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
on top of that list you were in the top
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
five in the country that's because we
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
have standards and so I'm not ready to
 
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
default to some National Standard or to
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
some other state let's keep it Hampshire
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
let's keep the granite state strong
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
where we are I can remember one day I
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
was over at doe and I heard this Ruckus
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
out in the
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
hallway I don't know if Mr applebe was
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
there on that particular day I I I
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
thought Paul leather was there as well
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
the Deputy
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and there's this young lady
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
out there saying why can't I get my
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
certification why can't I be licensed in
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
the state all I want to do is teach
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
kindergarten well the license was a K
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
through 8 license and as a school
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
administrator I often saw the
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
demographic of my schooling up and down
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
and people moved you mooved where your
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
demographic moves you might have a
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
combination class or you may say I need
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
somebody can teach this and I look at
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
your staff and and the principal makes
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
that decision you're now going to be a
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
sixth grade teacher and in my school we
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
had sixth grade kids Believe It or Not
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
were in
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
pre-algebra not all of them but we when
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
we taught math in that School everybody
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
taught math including the PE teacher the
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
music teacher Etc this young lady if IID
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to use her in some other level
 
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
and that she couldn't have done it but
 
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
she was arguing I can't pass that
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
practice okay then what are you going to
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
do about it you're going to maybe go
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
back to nhti and and and or maybe get in
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
involved with the math learning
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
communities program so I think it's
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
important that if you're going to have
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
that lure that type of certification
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
then you're you're you have to meet our
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
standards and our standards are we want
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
kids coming out of high school that can
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
get a job in career have a pathway now
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
the one thing that I understand that
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
this this bill may need to address a
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more and understand
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has a amendment
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
to it which and I don't care which one
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
you use 440 or this one it doesn't make
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
a bit of difference to me I just want to
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
see our state maintain where we are our
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
standards when it comes to Career
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
Technical ucation representative Cornell
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
you're very involved with that as well
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
um we recognize that there's trades that
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
are very very important try to find a
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
plumber try to find an
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
electrician I had my my wife had the
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
stove go out the other day it's a gas
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
stove you know the oven course is run by
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
electricity and or not electric gas but
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
the panel showed cf2 on it I said what
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
is cf2 you know that's where all the
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
numbers come up where the timer is and
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
all this and she's pretty good at it I
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
just love eating the stuff that comes
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
and we had to find out what cf2 meant
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
and it meant that the the motherboard
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
behind this stove up top had to be
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
replaced or it told you you have to go
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
to this place of course they don't give
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
you a manual you have to get on the web
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
to find that out and I want folks coming
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
out that have the ability that are
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
working in the trades to be professional
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
in that industrial area that that
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
content area that they need the practice
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
may not be the equipment to do that to
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
for the assessment we may want to look
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
at some other type of assessment that's
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
why we're not saying practice in this
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
thing we're saying assessment so if
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some more definition
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
done through um the uh folks over at doe
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm all for it because we need to have
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
instructors in our our CTE programs the
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
know about Plumbing that know about the
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
the electrical part that I mentioned
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
earlier and if you have 30 years there
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you're coming in from Napa and you
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
have Nappa certification in certain
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
areas and you have this understanding
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
about the content and
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
skills Concepts behind it that's the
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
person I want fixing my car not the guy
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's learned everything out of a book
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
and never really practiced it uh there's
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
that little thing we call OJT on the job
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
training if you have a lot of good
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
experience I'm good for it so but we
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
still want to maintain those standards
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
for the classroom teachers and
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
and so I I support doe and their efforts
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do this this bill is brought To Us by
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
them so I I'll conclude that you've had
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
this spill before so I'm not going to go
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
there I want to thank you very much and
 
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.230 align:start position:0%
there I want to thank you very much and
good

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
luck thank you uh chairman lad uh any
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative Woodcock
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
true if I may Mr chair the first one to
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
comment that F2 means buy your wife a
 
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.949 align:start position:0%
comment that F2 means buy your wife a
new

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
stove yeah and I I I don't know if they
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
sell them right up in Conway uh that
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
type I was looking for but uh and
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
they're not cheap that's true the the
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
second part I made Mr chair yes um Rick
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
on on your part about 10 11 and 12 when
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about CTE in 440 and the
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
the bill we had yesterday it allowed for
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh the basic academic skills or an IND
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
an industry recognized certification uh
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
as the option but in
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
your uh 362 it just talk more about the
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
waiver and it doesn't have that minimum
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
reduces as I look at it it reduces the
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for CTE professional uh
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
vocational instructors by taking away
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
any industry piece and just a waiver so
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what the thinking was
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
there we have worked on the uh CT
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and there's an effort
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
there we've looked at certification and
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
we we we we made recommendations on that
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
and we know it's very difficult to find
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
these people in to work in our CTE
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
programs they're competing with industry
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's more money in the
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
industry side of that I'm all for uh
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining a high level focus of
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
Standards if you were to talk to the
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
directors of the CTE centers I think
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
they support that that's a lot of this
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
langine which you're seeing that's
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
coming from doe has come by way of uh Mr
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
Jeff beards who is the person who works
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
with it so if this is going to come out
 
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
from doe for that need for that
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I do support it uh I support
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
their efforts they recognize that uh CTE
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
are not exactly the same as teaching
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
social studies in the classroom um
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pedagogy that they have
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
to have I will agree on that sh
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
clarification yes follow up I understand
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
that my my concern I understand that my
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
concern is and I appreciate CTE stuff
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that you in your bill
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
you've re we've taken out the phrase
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
that allowed the industry recognized
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
credential and that and I think that's
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
what we're both talking about is that if
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
you have an industry credential that
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
that would be fine but in your bill
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's gone it just talks about the
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
waiver and I see I was leaving it more
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
open for the the rules to make that
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
decision industry type credentials they
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
they vary and as you know uh we have
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
Folks up at White Mountain Community
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
College uh getting that degree and
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
Welding okay and when they come out of
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
that CTE program they're assessed on the
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
industry standard by a person that's a
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
member of that Association so uh you
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
might have a different standard and
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
different way it's issued um you might
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
be able to get it out of aerial box I
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't know but at any rate I I think
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we need to make sure those
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
standards and I'm not the person that
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
equipped to make that decision I was
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
trying to leave it open so through the
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
rul making process which come back to
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
Jael car Steve can do his job than sure
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions of
 
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.509 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions of
Representative

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
lad uh seeing none thank you um I see Mr
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
applebe from the Department is here um
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have him come forward
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
because I think that there were
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
additional conversations At Doe about
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
these bills um after our hearing
 
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:04.590 align:start position:0%
these bills um after our hearing
yesterday

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning uh
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Steven appy
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
director Department of Education hope
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
everyone is well this morning um I had
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
proposed some uh wording changes to an
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to 440 from yesterday which is
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to the bill um
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduced this morning and that
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment would address um several uh
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
items some of which came up here
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday in test in questioning and
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and the other um just to be
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
more precise for CTE so um I I have
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
supplied a copy of that Amendment um but
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
essentially it would it would add the
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
word initial in front of New Hampshire
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
license which would take care of
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
Representative woodcock's question and
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so now it it clearly says initial
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
lure not um seeking it's seeking an
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
initial license so that is much clearer
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
um the I've also um added language
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
specifically exempting CTE teachers from
 
00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:04.269 align:start position:0%
specifically exempting CTE teachers from
this

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
requirement and then modifi the language
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
that talked about industry recognized
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
credential because the way that the bill
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
upon um one of my folks came to me
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday and said you know the way this
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
reads it could be interpreted as this
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is um the way
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
the original wording read it talked
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
about basic academic skills
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
testing but this bill is also talking
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
about content testing
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't clear that a CT teacher
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from content testing the
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
way the original language was written so
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
we've we've gone ahead and clarified
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that in the amendment um and also but
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
left in that language about basic
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
academic skills testing and Industry
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
recognized credential just to codify
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
that that is the current practice today
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
in administrative rule but it's not in
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
statute so represent Marie thank you Mr
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
I do have an additional question if
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
there you said initial like sure with
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
regard to CTE or or traditional like uh
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
academic classroom settings um in the
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
event that somebody were to pursue an
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
additional type of CTE program such as
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
they were going from um like an
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
automotive to some other Science and
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
Technology sort of CTE program would you
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
require a separate certification for
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
them moving from
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
one to another yes so non C that's a
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
simple answer they have chemistry they
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
want biology they have to apply for
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
another endorsement on their license CT
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
is a little different in that we have a
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
CT specialty um endorsement and that
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
tends to cover a lot of these things so
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
um many times they wouldn't have to
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
apply there are instances but it's much
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
much less common than it would be in the
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
academic subject
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
areas representative Cel thank you so
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
much um so you referenced an amendment
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
do we have copies of that not yet uh
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
just got it last night um so yeah we can
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh easily um amend one of these bills
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
and uh you know maybe it all the other
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll take a look at getting
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
that done next week okay thank
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock thank chair
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
Mia thank you for being here again today
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
and particularly for listening to our
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
comments yesterday and and and helping
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
us with that U I'm looking at representa
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
lad's Bill uh 361 and I just want to
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
make them sure part about the CTE w
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much then uh negates uh in the
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
440 line that talked about the economic
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
skills and the the industry the industry
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
credential so am I understand you to say
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
prefer thank thank you for the question
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
um I I guess what we would prefer is to
 
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
not conflate basic academic skills tests
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
assessment tests with content assessment
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to carve
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
out um an exemption for CTE regarding
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the content exams okay and then add the
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
language keep the language to talk about
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credential and basic
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
academic skills and the waiver okay or
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
the substitution I should say of IRC yes
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so that that's the amendment
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
that represent cordelli is talking about
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you both
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
right any further questions C on thank
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you and um yeah we
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
will uh schedule the exec session for
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
both bills and uh put the amendment on
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
to one of these and uh possibly it all
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
the others and uh knock off to uh uh two
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
bills um and I'm not I our schedule is
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
already in for next week so it probably
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
be the the following week that we would
 
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.230 align:start position:0%
be the the following week that we would
do

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
that so if anyone has any other thoughts
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
um you know just let us know about those
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
two bills um so I'll conclude the
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill 362 and we have
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
a few minutes um until our next uh bill
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:57.590 align:start position:0%

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
well the one clock on the wall anyway
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
says uh 10:45 so uh we'll um get started
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
with the next uh bill was which is
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
hb90 relative to the definition of
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
part-time teachers and um representative
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
lad is back
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
again well thank you again
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and members of
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm here or first of all
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Rick lad I come from hav New
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's uh Grafton 5 and I'm
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
here today to present House Bill uh 90
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to definition of
 
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to definition of
part-time

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
teachers and I'd like to give a little
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
background just why did this bill come
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
about it came about last year we had a
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill which was much broader than what it
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
is right here you're going to look down
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
on this and you're going to see that
 
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.829 align:start position:0%
on this and you're going to see that
there's

00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
items which uh really Define what a
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
part-time teacher can be under this
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
section of law and the prior that it was
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
wide open it had almost the connotation
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
that you could take a person of this
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
character background content knowledge
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
and put them in the classroom and they
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
be full-time that's not where this bill
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
is this bill is specifically
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
designed and it came about during the
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference which we had
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
last year where we came out a committee
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
conference and all approved
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
it but the bill didn't become have the
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go forward because some
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
of those that approved it never signed
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
off on
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
it so here we are now part-time teacher
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
why well we have a program we call
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment in the state
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's where a high school student in
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
grades 10 11 and 12 has the
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they meet all the
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
prerequisites and if they're
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
eligible to take
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
courses that will also give them
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
graduation credit as well as credit in a
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
college level course that's what we call
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
concurrent that's taught by a high
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
school teacher dual enrollment is where
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's taught by a individual from the uh
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
College in the college
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
system when we have the course taught in
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
the high school by a local teacher they
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to meet the standards they have to
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
meet the standards of the accrediting O
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
organization Nei that accredits the the
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
school like I'll say nhti the community
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
college system you have to meet those
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
standards for what this how who teaches
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
this course you have to have a
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
master's you have to have this type of
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
material that's approved the syllabus is
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
approved it has to meet that Collegiate
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
standard that's the same material that's
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
used in the concurrent enrollment
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
program down in the high schools the
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
is we have some high
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
schools that do not have a person
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
teaching for example mathematics or a
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
stem subject that has a
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
master's and we had that occur we have
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
that occur in in Manchester we have that
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
occurring in Franklin and both of those
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
communities are communities that I hear
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
in the committee that I have and I heard
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
many many years here we don't have the
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
funding to really meet all our needs and
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have some excellent teachers that are
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
certified licensed that have bachelor's
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
degrees but they have a wealth of years
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
the wisdom that's necessary the content
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
is needed the concepts that are needed
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
to teach mathematics
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
so what happened in nhti working with
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein and those over
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
there at
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
nhti we were working out a
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
situation where a professor or an adun
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
could come from the community college
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
system to Franklin or to Manchester and
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
teach that
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
course the problem is that individual
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
who may have a PhD and
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
Mathematics are just the Masters but
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
years of experience teaching students to
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
become teachers or teaching within the
 
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.950 align:start position:0%
become teachers or teaching within the
math

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
certification issued by the doe to teach
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the high
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
school how do we get around that how do
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
we authorize that individual to come
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
down and work in that school where the
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
school doesn't have a Master's level
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
teacher to provide that concurrent
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment course why not use these
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
folks which the un uh the community
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
college system New Hampshire is anxious
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
and very supportive to do and willing to
 
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
and very supportive to do and willing to
do

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
that and you have those receiving
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
talents also willing to pay the
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
professors coming down to do
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
that but they don't have
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
certification so what this bill does it
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
enables that individual coming out of
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
the Collegiate level to come down and
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
teach that kid those students that would
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
really benefit from this course to also
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time receive concurrent
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment and that's
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
important we have students that are
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
graduating from our high schools that
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
have gone through this program Dual and
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
concurrent rollment in 10th Grade 11th
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
grade and 12th grade and they they've
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
taken up to those four courses each year
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
multiply that times the number of
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
courses they could they come out with a
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
semester worth of Education that's going
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
to prepare them with all the Gen gened
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
courses that you have to have at the
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
Collegiate level that's a huge savings
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
when we calculate the savings that
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
concurrent to on romance providing the
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
state it's over $10
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
million of later costs when we can get
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
this student that course for 150 bucks
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
verse three times that at the community
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
college system or if they take it at the
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
University it's a whopping a lot
 
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.710 align:start position:0%
University it's a whopping a lot
more

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
so the issue is I'm trying to enable our
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
students to get a program which is going
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
to better prepare them for their career
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
and pathway so looking specifically at
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
this bill why did we put down 20 hours
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
that they come down and they can teach
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
for a maximum of 20 hours per
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
week you and I know that it's basically
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
five five and a half hours of
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
instructional time that's stretching it
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
in a high school four four courses me
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
four for blocks or whatever and you look
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
at the grade schools the middle schools
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing and so if you multiply
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
times five 5 hours or five and a half
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
times the 5 days per week and you see
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
that 30 hours if we put down 30 hours
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
they could probably come down and tee
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
fulltime that's not what we're trying to
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
circumvent staff that are properly
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
certified and licensed in all those
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
areas and we're not trying to cut cost
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
by doing that no we're trying to provide
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all students here and
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is one way we can do it especially
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about those content
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
areas stem and Mathematics and Science
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is where that college level person
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
the adjunct or the professor associate
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
professors can come down and do this we
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
are not talking about coming down and
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
teaching in a course like special
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
education we cannot do that if you're
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
receiving money through the elementary
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
secretary Education Act Essa or if
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're in the area of
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
special education or ELO that by federal
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
law does not allow us to do
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
this those content areas have to be
 
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
taught in conjunction with those fedal
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
dollars which were coming down whether
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's by law or Federal Regulation or
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
federal code this program is not aimed
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
at those types of instructors going to
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
line do they have to have a criminal
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
background check yes yes they do we
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody in a
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
classroom with our minor students 18
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
years old or
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
younger in a classroom with an
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
individual we don't want anybody in a
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
classroom that hasn't had a criminal
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
background check I think we all agree on
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
that this all part-time Bill only is
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
applicable only
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
applicable if you look at Roman three
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
they are employed or contract as a
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
full-time or adjunct faculty member by a
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire or
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the only place this
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
part-time authorization can be issued so
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking now only only seven
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.230 align:start position:0%
we're talking now only only seven
community

00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
colleges we're talking about UNH
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
including Manchester and the law school
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about PMA State University
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
and K keing State College over on the
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
river those are the only places where
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
this part-time authorization can be
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
issued so in the last thing they're also
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
bound they're Bound by the code of
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
ethics and the code of conduct that's
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
written into this law that was as a
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
result of our discussions in committee
 
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.670 align:start position:0%
result of our discussions in committee
last

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
year so looking at the code of ethics
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
and the code of conduct they are
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
responsible to the
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
student they're responsible to their
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
profession and those that are working in
 
00:53:45.319 --> 00:53:46.710 align:start position:0%
profession and those that are working in
the

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
profession the responsible to their
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
community and they're responsible to the
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
use of Technology that's the fourth
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
title within those codes of of ethics
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
and then you look at the codes of ethics
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
and conduct and you'll see the
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
principles which are listed below and
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
the which the code of ethics is
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
aspirational and then you have the other
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
side of the code which is more conduct
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
oriented in actions that are
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
taken and they are regulated by Ed
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
rules so I think we've got that covered
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
very very much so that they the
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
part-time person is going to be account
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to have the bars
 
00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:30.030 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to have the bars
not

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
lessened I for one would really
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the person that taught
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
me geometry and that's where I learned
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
much my math but that's a subject I love
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
had come with the knowledge that a
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
college professor that I met who really
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
got it into me after I graduated from
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
high school um that person didn't have
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
certification but per that person was in
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
the profession for a long time and knew
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
his stuff so at that Mr chair I will
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
stop my
 
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.710 align:start position:0%
stop my
presentation

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
and take any questions you may have uh
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh representative lad for
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm just wondering
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the in a scenario of let's say I
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
teach at UNH and I teach fashion design
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
and bigh needs an algebra teacher for
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
two periods a day can they hire me for
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I guess I I don't see anything in
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the here about content so or you you'd
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
be coming down not with a fashion
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
degree uh profession to teach you know
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
pre-calculus calculus trig uh that
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
person it's going to be teaching that
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
through the concurrent enrollment
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
program is going to have to meet those
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
standards that the accrediting
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
organization not necessarily what
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
your Department of Education state board
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
of education has Lish yes but the
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
standards of Nei for accrediting that
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
institution you're coming from and the
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
department you're coming out of they
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
need to meet those standards that are
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
going to be you know used to if you're
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to be from your students going to
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
transfer from UNH to be a black bear
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
over Main and that's going a good
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
direction but um I'm a main graduate but
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
I think that the that the the things
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to transfer have to be uh
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
transferable and they have to be
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
measured by the same standard that's
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
what Nei is all about so no you're
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming down with the wrong credential
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
and your college is not going to let you
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
do that anyways and certainly Franklin
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
or Manchester are not going to welcome
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
you to come in and teach that Master's
 
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.430 align:start position:0%
you to come in and teach that Master's
level

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
course in in the content area you don't
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
have the background in okay thank you
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you Mr
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative lad for
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question and testifying in
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
front of us today so I need some
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
clarification um this is not looking to
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
replace or displace any full-time
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
District employees is that correct
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct so this is just to
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
augment a program that's already
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
existing to ensure that the program is
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
successful and the students are
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
receiving what they're signing up for
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
that is also correct what we're doing
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're supplementing that program we know
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
that there school districts in a
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
state a wealthy District might be right
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
beside a poverty-driven district the
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
wealthy District may have all kinds of
 
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.390 align:start position:0%
wealthy District may have all kinds of
AP

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
AP
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
courses they may have all kinds of
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
courses which are going to lead towards
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
those degrees that they're going after
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
the poorer District doesn't have the
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel sometimes they're looking to
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
VX where they can get that for that
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
course but isn't it always better to
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
have a class where you can see the
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
whites of the person's eyes just
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
teaching you and working with you and
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and your needs and
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
address those needs yes that's what this
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
does provide but they're coming in to
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
supplement enrich and provide the
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to all
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
children and this is what the city of
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
Franklin sees and this is what they'd
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
like to do what we're trying to do is
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
make that all possible for them and I as
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
a university of uh New Hampshire trustee
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
support this program 100% And I will
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
continue to advocate for it on the
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
trustee board thank you yes uh represent
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I did have a
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
question regarding enumerating the um
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
part-time uh hours per week in statute
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
is that potentially circumnavigating
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
board level negotiations and District
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is align the
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
need for this with and of course
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
bargaining Agreements are different from
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
place to place we're not trying to usurp
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to put in a standard
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
which will allow this to occur so um I
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any effort here I
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
think there's more of an effort to try
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
and work with various
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
associations that are anxious to see
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
students uh
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
offer that opportunity so I don't see it
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
as trying to circumvent I see it as an
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh provide and working
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
with uh I as a prior teacher myself and
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
as a prior supervising administrator of
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
of curriculum and instruction our
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
primary goal is to meet the standards
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the mission of Education in the
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
state open up your your statutory uh
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
books the annotated version the first
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
the first um section you will see is
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
where it spells out education is a
 
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.589 align:start position:0%
where it spells out education is a
shared

01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of all the
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
organizations and parents and school
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
districts and the community it's a
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility so um I think we
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
need to work together here um and I I'm
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that um this would be the per
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
the the perspective of those schools
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
which don't have the ability to do the
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment because they don't
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
have a master's teacher in the area of
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
chemistry follow thank you and thank you
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you're welcome I
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
do have one followup is isn't it
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
possible that a district can determine
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
that part-time might be outside of that
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
scope and and those negotiations are
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
something that happened in by District
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
if if the school board and the district
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
decides this is out of the scope they
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
don't have to do
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
this this is the the concurrent dual
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment person coming out of the
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
Collegiate level is coming down upon
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
invitation from the receiving District
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
which would be your District so if your
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
District decides we don't involvement
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
with this program fine but there are uh
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
districts out there right now including
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester who would love to have this
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this so it's again a
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
local decision uh if your board says we
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't want that it violates the
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreement then that's
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
Mor thank you Mr chair um so my only
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
question here is if a teacher Works 20
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
hours per week for a public school and
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
then 20 hours a week for a private
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
school would they still be exempt for
 
01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:45.589 align:start position:0%
school would they still be exempt for
the

01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
credentials by the private school are
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
you talking about a k through 12
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
situation correct no because they have
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
to be fulltime they have to be an
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
adjunct or a full-time person at the
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
University system or the community
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
college system so then then that's going
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
to they're the it's going to be the
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
happen uh rent s thank you Mr chair and
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions if I may my
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
my first one um says you've talked about
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
this as specifically addressing the
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
issue of concurrent class class ES or
 
01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:29.559 align:start position:0%
classes that are dual enrollment and I I
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
have a child who's currently enrolled in
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
those as we speak and is in her final
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
exam for one of them um I don't see in
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
here in your build specificity of
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
language that says this is strictly for
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach only those concurrent
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
or dual enrollment classes so you know
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
does that open the spill up so that
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
someone who might be certified um as a
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
culinary arts instructor comes and
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
teaches culinary Arts at the high school
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
or teaches kindergarten for that matter
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
for a part-time kindergarten program I I
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
I don't see where it's specific to only
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
teaching the concurrent dual enrollment
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
classes where that is where you're
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
saying that there's a need that's my
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
first question yeah oh this program is
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
designed for the personid to come down
 
01:03:18.269 --> 01:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
and uh teach the college level course so
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be coming down in
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
doing kindergarten because kindergarten
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
everything you need to learn is learned
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten so from A to Z and it's
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
all day long uh so we're not going to
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
send somebody to come down and be a
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
full-time teacher in kindergarten or a
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
first grade or second grade or third
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
grade this is going to be aimed
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
primarily at those content areas and
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's what it was designed to do uh
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
where students don't have that
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive that biology
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
class or or not biology maybe it's just
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
a highlevel mathematics that's going to
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
give them that college credit so
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
followup so for followup so partly I'm
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we need to just amend
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
this to put the specificity that it is
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
exclusively for those dual enrollment
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
college level classes and my other
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
question associated with it is where you
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
talked about the teacher The District in
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester saying they don't have
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds to cover the cost of
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
Master's level teachers wouldn't it make
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
more sense for us to increase State
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
funding to our public school system so
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
that they can afford to do that so
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
you're not talking to the chair of the
 
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.190 align:start position:0%
you're not talking to the chair of the
funding

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I hear you uh first of
 
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.430 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I hear you uh first of
all

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
um on on the first portion of your
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
question there I if you see an area
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
which you think it's going to really
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
strengthen this program and speak
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
directly to those content areas I'm open
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
to any kind of recommendations to come
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee th this is not my bill this is
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
a bill which is designed and was
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
crafted kind of like on the 11th Hour
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
the 11th day 11th month in committee
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
conference last year um but it came as
 
01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:57.109 align:start position:0%
conference last year um but it came as
result

01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
of input from the Department of
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
Education and obviously from the
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
community college system so yes uh if
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
you can strengthen the bill um I'd go
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
for it um what was the second part the
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
this part money money yeah yeah I didn't
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
want to talk to money thank you
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
representa Hall um
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
the money is an issue this year for us
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
all and I don't want to get really off
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
course there we are working diligently
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
are trying to address that we recognize
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
communities which are property poor
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
communities that cannot provide this we
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
have known
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
this for years and we have chipped away
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
at the seams for a number of years as
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
well that was the whole intent behind of
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the funding
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
formula where we're looking at the
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
monies are in many communities right now
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
due to increasing assessed property
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
values and the tax rate and all changing
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to go down in too deep
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
here that we're going we're watching
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that right now that's
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
what I spent all morning yesterday
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with folks on so we're we're
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
trying to address that issue we're also
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue that we know our
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
revenues are not catching up with some
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
needs thank you represent woodcock
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
thank you CH re lad welcome back again
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh a couple questions to follow up to
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I had the the question as the uh my
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
counterpart down here about your
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue specifically identify
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent or dual enrollment classes
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not Amplified here um
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting that it doesn't open
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
the door or other things but that's
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's your your dialogue in the
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
presentation was just that interesting
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
you said hesis hesis means stand still
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is not standing still is moving
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
forward with a wonderful little piece
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
there the um the other question I do
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
have is if there's two pieces uh on the
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
SE eight Letter's lines eight and nine
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay I I don't have that but you just me
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
the Roman that's okay um one was it says
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
the employed to contracted by I'm
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if it should be
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
currently uh if I was employed as a
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
adjunct at Manchester Community College
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
was employed does that mean I can do
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
this now it doesn't say that that's the
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
first question um and secondly
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
you're implied that the community
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
college or the university system has to
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
allow this because you're saying that
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
they're coming down they have to allow
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
this from the college there's nothing
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
here that says that the community
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
college or the university system has to
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
allow this to happen as I as I read this
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
bill it just says if I if I'm employed
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
they are employed does say currently but
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
they are employed U which may assume
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
currently uh by either one of the
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
institutions I have the right to come
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
down and do that by a Schoolboard
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't say I have to get permission
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
from the University system so if I'm
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
teaching one adjunct night course in
 
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
Psychology at uh Manchester Community
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
College that means under this piece it
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what Manchester Community
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
College says to me because I've met
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
their guidelines I have the right to go
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
down to teach at kenon high school um
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
under this bill is that correct yeah
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
there are two questions there and the
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
first one uh can somebody who was in the
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
community college system no longer there
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're retired Etc the this is not past
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
tense it's R they so uh we're talking
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
about they have to be employed currently
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
currently now that's how I read that by
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
the the U the verb of being there are
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the second point there they dealing with
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
permission uh and and and credit is
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
issued by the uh community college
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
system and the way this program is now
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
changed the administration of this
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
program is not done through doe any
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
longer it's done by the community
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
college system the monies go directly to
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the re reimbursement is done through
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
there other words we appropriate the
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and they go to the community
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
college system so before somebody's
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
going to get involved with coming down
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
the the community college system is
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to be aware that this has happened
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
and they have the capability saying yay
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
or nay as to this person's coming down
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
the request comes from the city of
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester or the city of Franklin or
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
could be a community a town to the to
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
the um community college system saying
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have somebody that has a
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
master's do do you have somebody that
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
can and there's going to be approval
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the community college to authorize
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
that person to come
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
down te okay thank you thank you for
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
that um but it then goes back to the the
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
question that was generated earlier so
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
is it specifically I understand that
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying now I just can't go down
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
to the high school even though I teach
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
ad I have to go through the system apply
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
there I understand that the school
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
system has to ask do you have any staff
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
that could do that but you are you
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about concurrent
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
and dual enrollment classes or you
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
the the program we have right here is
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
designed because you you have to have a
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
master's level program so what what this
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
program's designed around is the
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment program to
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
get college credit at the same time
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're taking this course if we were
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
having a person come out of Sno for
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
example they don't have to come out with
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a a masters they they can do this
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment through
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
through a person with a bachelor's
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
degree we have a higher standard in this
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
state with our Public Schools so uh I
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
hope that helps you that addresses it
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
well more okay you know I know just a
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
comment it doesn't address it represent
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
lad because it didn't answer the
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
question the question was does the
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
person have to be taking classes in a
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
concurrent or dual enrollment
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
program if that's what this all if
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's all this is that's terrific
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this is all about
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
that well then
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
amend it to say that thank you president
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you um also um so I'm curious
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this also
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
potentially puts a a district and a
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
college or university system in conflict
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
or communication with one another about
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
any rollups and benefits of who is
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paying for them if this
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
is a 20 hour per week as it's stated in
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
statute like I'm just not sure can you
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the the paying of this person
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
comes down Franklin's willing to pay
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
them to come down during their
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
time uh however the university system is
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to also receive that $150 for that
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
course because it's it's a it's
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
accredited through the accrediting
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
organization it's authorized through
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
them the university system has community
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
college system has to approve uh what's
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
going on they have to ensure that that
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum is in align with the
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
standards that the Community College set
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
you just can't call them say hey I have
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
this course that I'd like to have you
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
have send somebody down to teach they're
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to say I want to look at that
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
syllabus I want to look at that
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum make sure it parallels what
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
we do at the Collegiate level if it
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't you're not going to get this
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
down one question could this I'm sorry
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
could this be used this language in this
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
bill um to address uh schools where
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
there is a teacher shortage for instance
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
uh teaching uh an AP Math course or
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
Advanced algebra or something like that
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
oh this is where you could have if
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to do the concurrent dual
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment process I think that'd be
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
great there the teacher shortage is we
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
we had had a committee dealing with
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
shortage here several years back and
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is a real problem there's areas we
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
know where those shortage areas are
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
although you can talk to director app
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
will be behind me he says we we've
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
issued more licenses in the state than
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
ever before um and so in some areas that
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage nationally it may not
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
be in our state but we do know that
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
there are certain programs that we have
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
huge shortages in and Career Technical
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
education is crying for some of these
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
areas and they also offer career Uh
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
current dual enrollment at CTE centers
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful but we do have those shortage
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
areas try to find somebody that's
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
inversed in in in some of those Sciences
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
we want taught the AP level when I was
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
an administrator up in Alaska I couldn't
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
keep them in my district I had Arco and
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
BP anybody that came in with a degree in
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
biology or or geology or chemistry was
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
just sucked right up by them and they
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
could triple the salary of that person
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
just in in you know the matter they walk
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the door and so there is a shortage
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to compete and we're trying
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
to compete
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
with salaries that we're paying here are
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
far below what industry and I and I I
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that I saw it I i' I've felt
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
it um I find a good chemistry teacher
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to be willing to come in on
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
board and start with a salary of
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
$425 which is the average beginning
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
salary at the low side they're not going
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
it yes represent Cornell
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair so chair cordelli just
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
asked if they could come and teach an AP
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
class and now I'm confused because I
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
think you said yes they could go teach
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
the AP class but what if the AP class is
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
not part of the current end dual
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment it's a good question
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
representer Cornell and I I think that
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
what you ought to do is ask the
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
department that question um
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
the for it's my understanding when we
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
designed this it was for the the the C
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment program we
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
have AP courses but you know the
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
standards for AP courses you know I have
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
two grandkids right now that are in a
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
school taking nothing but AP courses but
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
some of the folks are teaching that are
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
not just Master's level they're
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
bachelor's people that are teaching some
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
of those AP courses and they're doing a
 
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
great job but that but and it's not in
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
the state it's at St Johnsbury Academy
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
and and so um that's a good question you
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
might redirect that to the department um
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
I I believe that the AP courses do not
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
have the you have to have a master's
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
teach I I don't believe that's the
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
case represent Woodcock than represent
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
Corell this is this is um sort of yours
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
um your your question as I interpreted
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
it was opening this to um um all teacher
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
shortage areas which you dialog last
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
couple years as as an Avenue of success
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
for Teacher shortage um and I understand
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
that okay and I heard representative lad
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
saying sort of vacillating on that piece
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
um as compared to what this intent of
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is so if the intent of the bill
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm guessing an amendment is to just
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
specifically concurrent of dual
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment then that's one function but
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
the intent is to go where you were
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
talking I think um and trying to help
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
the entire State on teacher shortage is
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
a whole different uh dialogue and I just
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
was that where you were going with that
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
I I was just asking the question I'm not
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
a the sponsor or a co-sponsor okay well
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
clarity representative Murray thank you
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
question for my own I I'm curious do do
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
VX programs offer concurrent or dual
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment courses to and would this
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
program I I can't answer that for you I
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
I I've never had that question posed to
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
me and I'm VX is a charter school run by
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
the state um they're they're widely used
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
I I know that they can they can do some
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
high level courses like
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
AP but I I do not know about going
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
crossing over the line and the other
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
courses I've been talking
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
about there they're they're they're not
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're not the university system
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're not the community college system
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
and that was the in my getting involved
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill initially was trying to
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
make that Avail these types of courses
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
that these folks are presently teaching
 
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
at the college level available to those
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
districts which don't have the Personnel
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
that can do this then don't meet those
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
national standards or our state
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
standards I'll correct that that we
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
require to have a master's
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
program yeah Ros s thank you and thank
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
you for indulging me in one more
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm just wondering
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetically couldn't someone who's an
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
adjunct with this bill an adjunct at one
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
of like nhti or one of the other schools
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
apply for a part-time position at any
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
school based upon this to teach any
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
course as a way for school districts to
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
hire a part-time and avoid having to pay
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
someone a full-time salary with then
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting into another
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
domain here where they're becoming an
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
employee of the school district and then
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to work with the
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
folks behind me here to get proper
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
certification licensure this is just
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get authorization to teach for
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
those that are coming down to help out
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
in these courses I've spoken to so if
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to become a part-time
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
employee here and a part-time employee
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
there I I think you're you're you're
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
crossing over on the side where this
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
this this particular legislation
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover that but is it clear this
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't sorry thank you it I'm I'm just
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how this would stop
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
that from happening because it it's not
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
here I'm I'm getting a little bit lost
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
in your question here because you're
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
talk to say okay they a part-time person
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
at the as an adjunct at the University
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
system but they are you know work there
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
as is stated right here um which which
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
they are employed to contract as a
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
full-time or adun members so would you
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
like they're not going to be part-time
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
at the University level they got to be
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
full-time can I clarify what I'm asking
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
so say for example I was hired by Great
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
Bay Community College to work for them
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know and I I'm employed by them
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm a master's level right
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
teacher um and I'm teaching all of my
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
classes for them in the evening for
 
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.030 align:start position:0%
classes for them in the evening for
evening

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
evening
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
structure and then the Dober School
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
District posts a 20 hour a week position
 
01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:34.709 align:start position:0%
District posts a 20 hour a week position
teaching

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
English so there's this doesn't stop me
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
from or teaching I don't know Spanish
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
not that I speak Spanish um other than
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
get me in trouble but um you know does
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
this do anything to
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
stop it seems like this gives do a way
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
to hire me without my having any
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
certification in that other subject area
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm teaching full-time at the
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
University in the at the community
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
college in the
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
evening without my needing to have the
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
same level of
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
certification so that's that's I'm
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure figure out how this
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm I'm trying to I'd have to
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
take your question and think a little
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
bit more about it before I shoot off the
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
cuff here on that um I I believe that if
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to be a full-time employ
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
employee whether it be during the day or
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
night they're a full-time employee
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
coming over and working then
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
part-time they're working nights they'd
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to do full part-time during the day
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe in the morning um it's um it's
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
possible they could be doing that uh I
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't but they to come in and be working
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
as a part-time they'd have to meet those
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and those standards set by
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
education see no more questions thank
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
you very much representative lad we have
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
a couple more people yeah who would like
 
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.430 align:start position:0%
a couple more people yeah who would like
to

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
testify um starting with Brian Hawkins
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
just checking the clock to make sure
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's still good morning uh good morning
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh for the record Brian
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
Hawkins representing uh Nea Hampshire uh
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
we represent uh in first time before the
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
newly minted uh education policy
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
committee um we repres for those of you
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
who don't know we
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
represent uh School staff ranging from
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
teachers to par professionals to various
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
support roles uh we o do represent some
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
higher education as well so um I'll I'll
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
um to skip over some of the comments
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
that I think have have been addressed
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
but hopefully I can address some of the
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
some questions um any ANH is opposed to
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 90 U as it's written today uh
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
we appreciate what representative lad I
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
think is trying to do here but I don't
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
think the language before you uh does
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
that uh and so there are uh alternative
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
Pathways to uh to to becoming a
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
certified educator in a school um we've
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about those uh when
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
this bill came before the education
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee last year um I think the
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of some of those Pathways as
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
well as you know the traditional route
 
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
of going through school is the support
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
that you receive uh the classroom
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
experience at the elementary middle high
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
school level which is very different
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
from a college setting and um you know
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
the community college system has a huge
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
range of students in terms of you know
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
their age and their experience uh it's
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
not the same as uh you know Middle
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
School um so um and with some of those
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
um Pathways there's if you're coming
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
from another profession there's a plan
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
in place how do you get the kind of
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
supports that you need the mentorship so
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
that you are um so that you're adapting
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
not only to the school U but to the to
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
to the climate in that school and of
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
course um as we've talked about before
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's there's uh the
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
pedagogy that you um learn uh that you
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
experience um and that um you know a
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
university system or Community College
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
faculty you know they may have a
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
talented uh writer that they bring in to
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
adjunct a class um and um but without
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
you know that sort of plan in place this
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
could be very
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
difficult uh today is a very difficult
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
time to teach even for experienced
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
teachers uh who are regularly going to
 
01:25:09.639 --> 01:25:10.709 align:start position:0%
teachers uh who are regularly going to
professional

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
development um and and
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
regularly uh uh you know de developing
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
in between the times that they seek um
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
their renewal for certif certification
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
for example exle
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
um so uh that professional development
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
we think is is very key uh that brings
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
up another point we have concern with
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
this bill unlike other uh Pathways like
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
say for example the one-year
 
01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
certification this is not time limited
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
so there's no uh limit to as it's
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
written here as to being able to be in
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
the status of um part-time teacher so
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that brings up a couple of things
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's the issue around the
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
criminal records check and how often
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
that has to be done um on that
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
particular topic uh apologies for
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
jumping around a little bit but um I
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
think it does need to be checked on
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 about that the candidate is
 
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
Seeking a criminal res record check I
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
believe for uh the folks who are in a
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
school right now you have to have
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
completed that check not just so seek so
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
um just I I I would encourage you to
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
match up the language if if if I'm
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
mistaken on that uh if you decide to
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
move forward with this um and uh as well
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
as um so so in addition to the questions
 
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.030 align:start position:0%
as um so so in addition to the questions
around

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
um the time limit criminal records check
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
but also just what what is being done
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
for that person if they're going to
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
continue to stay work 20 hours a week
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
what is the support that they're going
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
to receive to make sure that they are uh
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
you know best able to serve um
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
students uh we talked about the last
 
01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.870 align:start position:0%
students uh we talked about the last
bill

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
um about standards
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications um you know as I read it
 
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
in here there's nothing about any kind
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
of assessment testing for Content area
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
um and so and that whatever subject area
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
that person may be teaching as a
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
community college Adjunct professor that
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
I think this was raised earlier that
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily what they're coming
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
in to do at that school and so uh it the
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be silent on that I'm not
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think that was the intent but uh
 
01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
to to leave that silent but I don't
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
think it's something that ought to be
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
left up to like the rul making process
 
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:48.990 align:start position:0%
left up to like the rul making process
for

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
example um so subject area
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
requirement uh that you've you know
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
shown that you know uh the content as
 
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.750 align:start position:0%
shown that you know uh the content as
well

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
um the code of conduct piece I mean the
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
question uh I have about this is you
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
know one that we raised last year is how
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
does that work for an unlicensed
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
individual um and I think uh I haven't
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
heard that articulated how that how that
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
would work um and so that's an open
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
question that I'm posing here
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
um as as you work on this
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
bill uh and then finally just to close U
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that this will appear
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
as if the legislature is taking um a
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
step in trying to ease the educator
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
shortage but I don't think this is doing
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
that um you know the Band-Aids can often
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
be considered the solution when they are
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
only maybe exacerbating the issue of
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
what we ought to be focused on and I
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
think this was brought up earlier is
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
increasing Aid to local school districts
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
so that they can pay competitive wages
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
for their uh not only to compete with
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
other school districts you know Franklin
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
to Portsmith or you know but also uh as
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we have a lot of
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
alternative certifications uh being
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
issued people changing careers um and if
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to compete um that is going
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be critical and so for a community
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
that cannot you know struggles to raise
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
those funds to be able to to to do that
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
um I you know this is not uh solving
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
that problem so uh thank you for your
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
time I put two minutes I probably be
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
over that so appreciate that uh any
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
questions rtion of Hall thank you Mr
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
question U Mr Hawkins in uh great to see
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
you here uh in your reading of this did
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you see it as a concurrent dual enroll M
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
bills uh no I I um I mean I I appreciate
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
what I heard from repres represent L's
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that that is that that seems
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
to be the
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
intent the language just seems to be
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
lacking there and so thank
 
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
you and resent
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us today so from
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
your understanding what grades are the
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
Dual and concurrent enrollment uh
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
program addressing because I heard you
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
say something about middle school and
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
Elementary School what grades do you
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
understand that those programs address y
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and I
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
think that partly goes to uh
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's question as well
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
in that um uh dual and concurrent dual
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment uh being the
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
high school level this doesn't specify
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't specify either the
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
grade levels or the Dual concurrent
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment program um it seems to allow
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
for you know any grade um at least as
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
it's written so thank
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
you yes representative um B
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
bony thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if this bill
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
was reworked um for the more narrow
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
objective of dual concurrent enrollment
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh would you feel differently um and
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
what questions would you
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
have um so I think the questions we
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
would still have
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
is uh you know I mentioned the time
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
limits um some of the other uh Pathways
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
have a you know a renewal point or a a
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
point at which
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's a
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
reassessment here so I think lacking
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
that I would be concerned
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
that um you know whoever the individual
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
is could just sort of stay in that
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
particular position and and through
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
notfall of you know I think the school
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
is pro is TR trying to do the right
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
thing they're trying to you know uh fill
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
positions and make sure their students
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
are getting the offering but you know
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're not doing a service to the
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
students either if we're if we're not um
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know paying attention to uh you know
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
how's that how's that educator doing are
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
they getting the supports that they need
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
and um you know that that time just like
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
if you were a certified educator you
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
have that period where uh of of of
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
non-renewal where where where if it's
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
not working and you're not someone who
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be in that profession the
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
school district has that option and um I
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
know that's a little different from what
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today but my point
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
in raising that is more about the the
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
ability to go and and sort of reassess
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
Woodcock chair I actually one of the
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
question question is exactly what I had
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
is is um this young lady to my left
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
uh Mr H following up on on your
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
point if um and I I I think the intent
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the concurrent dual enrollment is is
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
terrific um honestly uh however if a a
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
part-time employee came uh to a school
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
system like this um but they still be
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
res and this may be in various school be
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
different I don't know but how would
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
they then be
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
evaluated um and would they be
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
responsive or required to do what other
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
faculty do in terms of faculty meetings
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
department meetings those things or are
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
they like an independent contract I
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've had any experience
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
with that I I don't so I don't know if
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
you have a if you may have a comment on
 
01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.270 align:start position:0%
you have a if you may have a comment on
that

01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
please yeah uh thank you for the
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
question um so I I think that's a little
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
bit of an open question I think it could
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
depend on a lot of things with respect
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
to you know the way the the particular
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
school is run um you know if they're uh
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
and as well as well as you know I there
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
was there there was a comment uh earlier
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
brought up about displacement so of of
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh existing positions and I go back to
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
sort of the the the Band-Aid question
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
about um you know
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
at a certain point if there's no time
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
limit here you're displacing um you know
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
full-time work and so
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I I bring that up also to your
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
question about you know would they be
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
subject to all these things I think it
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
depends I think it depends on uh the
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
school it depends on you know the
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
language of the bill depends on the rul
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
making um
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
so I know that might not answer your
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
question uh but uh I probably don't have
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
a great answer for you it it probably
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
depends on the school thank you thank
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
you thank chair yes thank you very much
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um representative alone I'm
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Cel thank you so
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you for taking and thank you
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you talked
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
about alternative routes to get
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
certified and so can you just give us a
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
couple of like two examples we'll keep
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
it really short of things that people
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
who are seeking alternative routes to uh
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
certification might get that are
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
essential to being successful at
 
01:35:26.189 --> 01:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
teaching at the high school level that
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
someone coming in from a community
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
college might not know that they need
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think mentorship is a
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
great example I mean um there's a great
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
I can I'm happy to get this to the
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
committee but um there are uh we and
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
we've talked about mentorship in this
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee before there are um you know
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
teachers I know who know that a
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
particular school has a really great
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
mentorship program and that that made a
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
difference for them in terms of what
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
school that they were going to uh you
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
know work at and so or they changed jobs
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
because of that it wasn't just you know
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
salary so I I think mentorship maybe is
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit offline with the
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you very much um we have
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
two more people who would like to
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
testify thank you uh representative
 
01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:29.270 align:start position:0%
testify thank you uh representative
alone

01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm Mark Malone I
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
represent the town of eeping I'm also an
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
educator 40 years uh plus or minus uh K
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
through 12 both as a teacher as
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
administrator at all
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
levels so I look at this bill and I
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
remember a a phrase one of
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
my uh colleagues used to say said we
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
hide in
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
ambiguity we hide in ambiguity
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
this is an ambiguous
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bill the way I read it and as a
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
principal looking for people I can hire
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
anybody for
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
anything as long as they have they come
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
through the university system or
 
01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:09.790 align:start position:0%
through the university system or
Community

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
Community
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
College pick the subject pick the level
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
I could have somebody come in and do 20
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
hours of uh tutoring and
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
reading can do it so my point is that if
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
and representative lad spent about 30%
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
of his conversation with you speaking
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
about dual
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment why isn't it in
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
here if it's that important put it
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
in but even
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
so based on
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
experience eping High School had a hard
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
time and still has a hard time getting
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
advanced placement teachers and getting
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in math and science I can
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
remember going through four biology
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
teachers in one year
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
as an administrator that was a
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
nightmare and then for advanced
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
placement math we finally we got a
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
brilliant brilliant PhD and math to come
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
in and teach advanced
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
placement he talked to his feet the
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
entire time and wrote on the board
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that there's going
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
to be a match between college level
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
professor and the needs of a
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
student no conversation about whether
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
these people can actually teach kids
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
and that's something that's right across
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
in education because the big assumption
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
is that anybody who has content
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge can teach and that's Croc
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
based on my
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
experience where's that where's that
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
protection in the
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill so the other thing I'll just say is
 
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
bill so the other thing I'll just say is
that

01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
um we have to have we have to have good
 
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
people teaching kids who know how to
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
teach this bill does not address that
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
directly and if it if you want to put
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
the language in there please do and I
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly looking at ad looking
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
at full-time staff from the University
 
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
system I would feel better about but
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty what are the
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
qualifications for being an adjunct
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
faculty member at a university or in the
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
system and again going back to what's
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
their ability to teach K through 12
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
kids I would put if you're going to
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
continue with this bill it really needs
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
some serious revision it needs time
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
limits because someone who has being
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
hired part-time year after year after
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
year they're not part-time
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
anymore and so the qualifications about
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
being able to teach kids should come to
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
the four on that so that's basically my
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you for your
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
either and for the first time I get to
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
say good morning chairman cardelli this
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
my first time testifying in front of
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
your committee I am very proud to be
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
here my name is debborah H I am the
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire we represent prek
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
through 12 uh Public School Educators
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
and staff as well as University faculty
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
public and private and uh Town employees
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here in opposition to this bill
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
especially as it is written it does not
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
specify the Dual and concurrent
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment if that were in there it
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
might address some of our concerns about
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
how wide reaching it would be but we
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
would still have some
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
concerns um and I will try not to repeat
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
what has already been said but we do
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%
have concerns about how this would
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
affect the student's experience in the
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
classroom as you know public schools are
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
different from community colleges and
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
universities Public Schools serve all of
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
the students in the district or at least
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
the ones whose families choose to send
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
them to public schools and those
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
students could have very different
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
learning needs um any child in a school
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
can take any class uh in high school
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
that they have meet the academ
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
prerequisites for so that means you
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
could have students in front of you who
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
have specialized learning needs who are
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
English language Learners who need uh
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
support with their learning based on
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
where they're at at learning the
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
language you could have uh accelerated
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
Learners you could have um students who
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
have behavior issues and you've got to
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
deal with them all as a teacher if you
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
are a University faculty or adun who
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
have come in you know to teach a class
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
as a part-time teacher you don't
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the background to
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
modify your lessons to meet all of those
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
needs in front of you if you're a
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
certified teacher you have learned about
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
that in your teacher preparation course
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
you have practiced it in your various
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
practicums in your student teaching and
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have been through some kind of
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
mentorship uh buddy teaching in your
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
first few years of teaching to help you
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
hone those skills so you know how to
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
deal with the students in front of you
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
so that you can keep them motivated and
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
on task as much as possible students go
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't get this learning time back if you
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how to do that so that's
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
really the main concern I have with this
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
from a student perspective if you get a
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
subject area expert who comes in who
 
01:42:41.709 --> 01:42:41.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't know to H how to handle the
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
meeting students need part of teaching
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
then it's not going to help students
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
learn you could have you know a
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
brilliant math teacher as someone said
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
who talks to their toes it's not going
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
to help them um and I do also have to
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
take a uh I have to disagree with the
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who said that it's not
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
supplanting teachers it's already
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
happening if you can't hire teachers
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
because you can't pay enough or offer
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
them the benefits to fill those slots
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
and you're
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
already taking in community college or
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
university teachers to fill those
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
concurrent and dual enrollment classes
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
then you're already supplanting
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh existing teacher you're filling
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
existing positions with outside
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
part-time uncertified teachers so
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise there will be pressure to
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
raise the salaries the real answer is
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
for this legislature to do its
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty by all of gr grite
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
State students and fully fund our Public
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
Schools so every single District can
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
offer the robust public education that
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
all of our students deserve and and uh
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I have to say thank you very
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome uh rent
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you chairman lad and
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
question my concern in listening to
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
having everybody come up here with their
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm still trying to understand
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
whether you're advocating for the staff
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
or the children right
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
now I'm advocating for both I want the
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
children who have a good experience in
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
the classroom and be able to learn but
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
all of them should be able to have that
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity not just a few so if a
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
student has some special needs the
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
teacher who is in front of them has to
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
be prepared to modify the lesson plan
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
and meet those those
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
needs that is part of the expectation in
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
a public school you're not just teaching
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
a few or teaching the middle or teaching
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
the best may I follow up quickly please
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes so if you are in one of these
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
courses I am assuming Maybe I'm Wrong
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
that you would be as a student in a
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
position I don't know how to put it
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
articulate this best but I would think
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
that you would the student would have to
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
be qualified to be in that class to
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
begin with and my concern is if I'm
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
hearing correctly that we have a
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
shortage unless a misunderstanding so if
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
we don't try to take this Avenue will
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
the children will be missing out
 
01:45:20.599 --> 01:45:26.350 align:start position:0%
the children will be missing out
completely

01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
we currently have a shortage
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
because we are
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
not offering
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
essentially wages that families can live
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
on in many communities so yeah you're
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask people to choose between
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
serving their community and keeping
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
their family housed and
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
fed people do not go into um don't take
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
a b property to go into education so um
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
that's why we have shortages in some
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
communities thank you very much y ument
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
Mong thank you chairman cordelli and
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you along the same lines I have a
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
similar question I'm having a hard time
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
understanding this if there is a teacher
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
that is passes a background check and is
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
willing to work and and is qualified to
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
teach in that subject area wouldn't it
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
be better to have that teacher in the
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
classroom than no teacher at all and the
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
class wouldn't be offered and the
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
students wouldn't have the opportunity
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
to take dual and concurrent
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment so if you want to talk about
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
it as a temporary measure then make it
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
temporary make it lapsing after one year
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
while you work on actually fixing the
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
30 thank you very much represent C
 
01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
quickly please thank you very much and
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
brought up meeting the needs of special
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
needs children or children with learning
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
challenges yes um is there something
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
that makes it so that learning
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
challenged children would not be in dual
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment classes for any reason or
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
would a certified teacher who's been
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
through an education program know how to
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
um honor an IEP or 504 for their
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
students a certified teacher who has
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
been through an education program should
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
be able to meet the needs with some
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
assistance from a special education
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
teacher perhaps maybe there might be an
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
area where they would need a suggestion
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
or two to help them modify a lesson plan
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about accommodations
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
where you have to change the content of
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
what's uh in the syllabus but you're
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
modifying either your delivery or or um
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
a time element or or something um but
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
there is no reason that all special
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
education students should be excluded
 
01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
from a dual enrollment or concurrent
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment course there's no reason an
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
English language learner should be
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
excluded categorically if they can meet
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
the academic prerequisites for getting
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
into the class they should be able to
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
take the class right I I think we're
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
getting a little off topic we just want
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
to make it clear in case I'm
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not teaching here repres
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
Murray quickly please we're a little bit
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
behind thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
to double check that I'm making sure
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're understanding that I I think to
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
one of the other members questions a
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
person can be twice exceptional and have
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
needs and meet the academic requirement
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
to be in that classroom yes but also
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
have needs that are required to be
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
successful in that environment yes and
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't even touch on behaviors
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
behavior management is a huge part of
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
teaching as well and that might be
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
something that a university Professor
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't encounter because students who
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
are paying tuition are more likely to um
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
be aware of focusing and and
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
um keeping up with what's going on in
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
class instead of acting out and and
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
disrupting others learning thank you
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
very much uh thank you for your
 
01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
testimony uh Becky

[Music]
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
floor good morning chairman cordelli and
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
I'm Becky Wilson from the New Hampshire
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
school boards Association I just wanted
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
to uh clarify a couple of things that I
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
think we heard when we were listening to
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
the other testimony previously as well
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
as to just um I think ask some
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
clarification or questions that we still
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
had which is one is to clarify um in
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
regards to the issues with the special
 
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
education needs and the training of an
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
adjunct or Professor or employee of the
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
community system coming down to the high
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
school level um just a reminder that
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
idea and special education ends when the
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
child receives a high school diploma
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
most colleges and community colleges UNH
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
system Etc don't have to comply with
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
special education or idea that is done
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
when students go to college uh Section
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
504 is a bit different but there are
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
some adjunct professors or employees of
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
the college system that would never
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
potentially have had training and
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
special education so they really
 
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily come with any of
 
01:50:28.589 --> 01:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
that background um and under the way
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is currently written it's
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
unclear about what kinds of training
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
they would need to have um or
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
professional development coming down to
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
the high school level and sort of how
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
that would play out for a person who is
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
there to teach one or two AP classes at
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
the high school level um in addition we
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
have some questions assuming this person
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
would be an employee of the school
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
district even though they are part-time
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's our belief that the majority of
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
those people regardless of part-time or
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
full-time at the high school if it's
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
just for high school um would still fall
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
under collective bargaining agreements
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
and the requirements for part-time
 
01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
employees or employees of the school
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
district they would still need to meet I
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
believe um any of the other like
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
mandatory trainings things like that
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
that any employees or volunteers of the
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
school district would need to be um held
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
accountable for uh so I think it would
 
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
just again when we're talking about
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
potentially offering some sort of clean
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
up language for this bill or an
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to consider sort of the
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
impacts of collective bargaining
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
agreements and on any employees of uh
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
local public school districts what are
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
the mandatory trainings and other things
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
that these people would be um falling
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
under that umbrella as well um I think
 
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
you know the way the bill was presented
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
by representative lad if it were really
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
to just be for dual and concurrent
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment um there are people
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
potentially who could just be teaching
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
one class at the high school level once
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
a day two hours but I think to be really
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
um clear about all the other pieces that
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
come with becoming a public school
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
employee regardless of how many hours
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
you work there or whether you're a
 
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer Etc I'm happy to take any
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
testimony um I think that closes this
 
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
hearing um on uh
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
hb90 uh let me see if um representative
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill is 235
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh 235 relative to amending the
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
Education Code of Ethics and code of
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
conduct to include responsibility to
 
01:54:59.199 --> 01:55:01.350 align:start position:0%
conduct to include responsibility to
parents

01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
um this this uh statutory language was
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
put in place several years back when we
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
realized once in the state there was a
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and code of conduct but
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory language so they
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
repealed it and then we put it back in
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
place and I don't know if you all have
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
this book but uh it's one where uh that
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
was passed out to the committee last
 
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
year it's the code of ethics and the
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and within that it
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
specifies that in the code of ethics
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
which is aspirational in nature as I
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the preceding meeting the
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is action items that
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
lead to conduct and possibly
 
01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.310 align:start position:0%
lead to conduct and possibly
disciplinary

01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
action the code of ethics in terms of
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
the aspir ational and in both areas have
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
four primary title areas which are part
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the code that we put into
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
statute a responsibility to the
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
education profession and educational
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
professionals so a teacher must be
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
professional towards people you're
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
working with and and your
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
profession B responsibility to students
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
obviously you're there for the primary
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of teaching students so you're
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
responsible to your
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
students C the third category
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to your school community
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
so at large those people you're working
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
community and D responsible and ethical
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
use of Technology as it relates to
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
students schools and other educational
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
professionals you know how you use that
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
how you interact on that web and all
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of that part right
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
there this legislation's been handed to
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
you because
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
nowhere in those four areas is the word
 
01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.310 align:start position:0%
nowhere in those four areas is the word
parent

01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
mention I was looking through as I was
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up my file cabinets I'm
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
still one that uses a lot of paperwork
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
and and I had stuff dating back to 2008
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
and I say well that's no good going like
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
that this is going in circular file Etc
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
I did that and then I came on this this
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
older file right here the code of uh
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
ethics ethical
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
behavior and then it I had all that
 
01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
stuff what what came from Connecticut
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
what came from Kentucky how we put this
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
together and I looked at one of the
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
areas which was the Preamble for the
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
Nea and in the Preamble it reads the
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
educator recognizes the magnitude of the
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
response possibility inherent in the
 
01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.270 align:start position:0%
response possibility inherent in the
teaching

01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
process the desire for respect and
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
confidence of one's colleagues so now
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the professionals
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
you working with your professionals your
 
01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:06.030 align:start position:0%
you working with your professionals your
Professional

01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
Professional
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
Organization of students that's one we
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
also have in our code right here as one
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
of our primary uh
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
principles of
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
parents I look for that and that's
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's not in ours as a
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
primary one of the four principles and
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
of members of the community so it
 
01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.510 align:start position:0%
of members of the community so it
mentions

01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
mentions
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
community and initially when we had the
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
technology side I can remember the task
 
01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
force saying maybe this ought to be
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
integrated in those other three and we
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature said no we're not going
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
there we want because where we're going
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
with AI where we're going with
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
everything else nowadays we need that as
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
a separate area of
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility because it's resulted in
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of happenings going on in
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
our schools today I believe and we'll
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
hear about that later when we start
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
talking about use of cell phones in
 
01:59:00.079 --> 01:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
talking about use of cell phones in
schools

01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
but I looked at that and started
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe we need to get this word
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
parent into the that one of those four
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
areas so then I looked at this code
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
right here and I do have an amendment
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to maybe I I to pass that out
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
for your consideration it would have to
 
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:22.589 align:start position:0%
for your consideration it would have to
be

01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:59:25.229 --> 01:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
introduced by somebody
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
within your committee Paul you want to
 
01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:38.350 align:start position:0%
within your committee Paul you want to
represent

01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
Terry the initial language that you had
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
before you was modifying Item
 
01:59:48.189 --> 01:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
B and it was saying responsibility to
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
student and
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
parent when I looked at this booklet
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
right here and took another look at it I
 
01:59:59.790 --> 01:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
realized maybe we put parent into the
 
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
wrong principle maybe it belonged
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and when I'm speaking to right
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
now I will read to you because I know
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
you all don't have this handbook right
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
here in
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
the area where it says responsibility to
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the student and when you look at those
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
principles underneath it
 
02:00:24.669 --> 02:00:24.679 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see the word
 
02:00:28.589 --> 02:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
parent and what the statute that we have
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's in this book right here we
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
through these four principles authorize
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
the State Board to develop rules in
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
support of those four categorical
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
areas so Ru making is is the result of
 
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of language within this little
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
handbook right
 
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
here so by putting the word parent in
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
that category B we're opening up the rul
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
making process
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
again but then I looked at principle
 
02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.589 align:start position:0%
again but then I looked at principle
number

02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
three and I said is that place that's
 
02:01:05.310 --> 02:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility and commitment to the
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
schools but actually in in in law it
 
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
says responsibility to the school
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
Community to the school
 
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
community and underneath that principle
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
it communicates with parents and
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
Guardians in respectful manner which
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
commits to equality equity and inclusion
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
of colleagues staff students parents or
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
Guardians and other members of the
 
02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:33.470 align:start position:0%
Guardians and other members of the
school

02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
Community respects diversity amongst
 
02:01:38.069 --> 02:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
colleagues staff students parents or
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
Guardians and other members of the
 
02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.709 align:start position:0%
Guardians and other members of the
school

02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
community so underneath that principle
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
three parents are mentioned several
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
times so then the thinking is
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps what I've done is introduce the
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
bill and put the word parent in the
 
02:01:55.239 --> 02:01:56.550 align:start position:0%
bill and put the word parent in the
wrong

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:01:59.550 --> 02:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
principle and so what I've offering you
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
right now is changing it from B to C and
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
saying responsibility to parents
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
Guardians and the
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
community therefore parents being up
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
there in that primary topical area are
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
supported by the language without having
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
to change that language internally
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
within this all we're doing is just
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
C I know you're in a are hurry here so
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to Bel labor this any
 
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
farther that's what the intent of this
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill is to to get the word parents into
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics as a primary
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility area parents are involved
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
in your schools I know it was a big deal
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
in my community when we had parent
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
teacher conferences and we scheduled
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
those in the
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
schools and teachers looked forward to
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
that cu we could get 89 to 95%
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
attendance out of a school that had
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 500 kids we could do it
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
and we aimed to do it and parents and
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
our teachers knew that working
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the parent is how
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to improve education that's
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
why we have things like PTA parent
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
teacher Association parent teacher clubs
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
parent teacher organizations pto's it's
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
important that we recognize and I think
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
by recognize in this code of ethics that
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
Guardians need to be there so that's it
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much representative
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you uh questions
 
02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.430 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you uh questions
representative

02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
represent L for taking my question um is
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
it your intent to just insert the
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
language then in the title of uh the
 
02:03:50.669 --> 02:03:50.679 align:start position:0%
current code of ethics or is your intent
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
um instigate a a review of the whole
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
booklet no by doing this well we we
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
should be we should be looking that
 
02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:05.629 align:start position:0%
should be we should be looking that
periodically

02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
here February 9
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
2022 I was asked to write a letter to
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and we'
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
been discussing
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
this and you'll notice that in the code
 
02:04:25.159 --> 02:04:26.510 align:start position:0%
this and you'll notice that in the code
of

02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
conduct there are three ways
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action can be taken place
 
02:04:34.990 --> 02:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
and the discussion we had had and we
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
huddled with the association we H
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
huddled with District our department
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
attorney in a separate room I think it
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
was the other half of this room and we
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
came up with language the first option
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
which we'd like to add in was
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
confidential letter of concern which
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
shall mean a non-disciplinary non-public
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
letter issued to the employee that would
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
be the first step so and and if there
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
was an issue with this it was handled
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
privately and with the individual
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
involved nothing was put in the record
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
then you get into other areas for
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
reprimand suspension and removal of your
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
ticket your license um I felt that it we
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
needed another step that was never done
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not aiming to have that done I'd
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
like to see it done but and this this
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
statute right this uh proposal this
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't speak to rules at
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
all all is doing is speaking to trying
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
to change that one section of law which
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I mentioned those four
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility areas that's all we have
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
the rest of this stuff that takes care
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
is already in law where the State Board
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
is given the task of support of writing
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of that what we have on under
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
rulemaking those supportive principles
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
which support that topical
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
area he
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
followup so I'm I'm not really familiar
 
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
with how often this gets re reviewed or
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
renewed and it must follow the same
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
processes defined in the in the law um
 
02:06:18.549 --> 02:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
frequently when this whole thing was put
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
together was a task course of people put
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
together it was generated by the
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislature when I came down to the
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
state from up north um I was familiar
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
with having a code of ethics and
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
professional conduct and as were all the
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
other states we had had one but ours was
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
repealed simply because we had no
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
statutory language that backed up what
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
jel car had done and so we put in place
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
the language those four personal areas
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
there are giving rule making authority
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education whether
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
they have since modified these things to
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge they haven't there
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
was a task force put together initially
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
to write what we have adopted in that
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
little book right now that was done by
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
teachers coming together working with
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
the department and um and that's that's
 
02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
the result I don't believe this has been
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
modified since then um back in 2022
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion written by myself
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner as a request of the
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
education committee as a whole to
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
consider this fourth option in the code
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
of conduct side um I don't believe that
 
02:07:42.599 --> 02:07:43.870 align:start position:0%
of conduct side um I don't believe that
has

02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
occurred because I I still operating out
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
of this and this has only three category
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
areas for reprimand suspension or or
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
removing your certification
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
certification representative
 
02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
Murray okay representative Hall thank
 
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
question I just want to be clear this is
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
replacing principle
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
three yes uh it's uh I buried my
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment right here Amendment yes it's
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's doing C okay so I would just three
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
ask about if you look at principle two
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh responsibility commitment to the
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
student so the word commitment has been
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
removed on commment on
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
which I'm I'm sorry it's it's um am the
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
you're we're looking at it's amending
 
02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:34.870 align:start position:0%
you're we're looking at it's amending
RSA

02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
219 n as you can see in the
 
02:08:44.549 --> 02:08:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're amending RSA say 21 and
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
N right okay so all
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
right okay I was just looking okay so
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
it's not principal two and principal
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
three it's more so the RSA over here
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's not exact thank
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
you and may I in looking at what is in
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
statute and what they have there is a
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
little bit different in the book but
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking only as your chair said n
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
n repr
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I do have a
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
one question Ru making Authority is
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
something that the department is then
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
granted pursuant to 219 n yes but uh 21
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
N1 is also enumerated um a policy of
 
02:09:47.549 --> 02:09:47.559 align:start position:0%
finding statement so in the statute
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
there is already reference prior to rul
 
02:09:53.549 --> 02:09:53.559 align:start position:0%
making to parents and students citizenry
 
02:09:56.189 --> 02:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
Local Schools Etc so the ru making
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
Authority would operate under 21n as a
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
whole correct yes
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative I I see we have one
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
more uh card oh no more questions thank
 
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
you very much I get out of here um Brian
 
02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:30.669 align:start position:0%
you very much I get out of here um Brian
Hawkins

02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you Mr chairman members
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee once again Brian
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hawkins representing NAA New Hampshire I
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
know we're Pas time so I'll try and keep
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
it brief um I have not seen the
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
amendment so I can't comment really to
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment I think um it just to
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
summarize I think our concerns
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
here uh lie with a lot of the feedback
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
we received is the the way uh the bill
 
02:11:00.199 --> 02:11:00.870 align:start position:0%
we received is the the way uh the bill
is

02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
phrased um Ed Educators see their
 
02:11:07.709 --> 02:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
student their students as their primary
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility and uh there's a lot put
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
on we've talked about this committee
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
before there's a lot put on Educators
 
02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to all sorts of rules
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
regulations that you need to follow um
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
and they just want to go in there and
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
teach and educate and so I think the con
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
the feedback that I heard and I really
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at the there were
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
quite a few people who signed in on the
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh and and did so with not just
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
checking opposition but you know many of
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
them U enumerated their concerns and and
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
and that was really the primary one
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
which was um at the end of the day uh uh
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
the respon their Prim Prim AR
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility is is to students um and
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
in the context of the code of conduct
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
specifically as to the professional
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
standard that they're held to that that
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
in that context is is is is critical uh
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
as representative lad said there is no
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
doubt that
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh the partnership with Educators and
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
parents engaged parents is critical in
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know getting to the best education
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
of our students so that's I'm not here
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
to Discount that at all um it's really
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the code in the context of um the
 
02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
code of conduct which was when they when
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
it was formed looking back at some of
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
the records um last night it was um the
 
02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
model policy that they essentially used
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
to to adopt the code of conduct there
 
02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
was not a separate provision um about um
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
parent it was Community which as
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative lad said has inclusion
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
about uh you know professionalism to to
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
to parents um but you know when there
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
are issues at the school district level
 
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
the uh Administration principle th those
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
are some of the folks that are are are I
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
think there to facilitate when there if
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's an issue uh uh with you know how
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%

on the intent because this does as it's
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
written does open up ruem and as we've
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
seen over a number of years there's a
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
lot of policym that tends to happen in
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
rule making when the legislature is not
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%

03:03:36.830 --> 03:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire I represent the
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom and uh first of all I want
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
to uh representative wer wants to
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being here today his
 
03:03:51.790 --> 03:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh grandson is becoming a Green Beret
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
today and he's at the ceremony
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
so so that's why you got me you know
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
pinch heading here um
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure without taking a survey that
 
03:04:07.309 --> 03:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
that the number one concern of your
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
constituents are the same as mine namely
 
03:04:14.269 --> 03:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes and um not necessarily
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
because you know in some technical sense
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
those are the worst TX taxes but but
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
those are clearly the most obvious taxes
 
03:04:24.550 --> 03:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
because everybody knows how much of
 
03:04:27.469 --> 03:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
those taxes they pay I mean we all pay
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
bet BPT all the you know gas tax and so
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
on but you know nobody knows how much
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
they pay on those taxes but you since
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
you write a check twice a year in most
 
03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
cases uh for property tax you absolutely
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
know how much you're paying and it's a
 
03:04:46.110 --> 03:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
lot of money because I think the total
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
of all property taxes is uh greater than
 
03:04:51.990 --> 03:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
the total of all other taxes that we
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
have right so it's it's our main major
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
tax um and and for the most part those
 
03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
taxes go to schools and um so everybody
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
is concerned with the cost of schools
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have this other
 
03:05:08.830 --> 03:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee you know the your committee
 
03:05:11.550 --> 03:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
was bifurcated and I'm sit on the other
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
one uh dealing mostly with money and um
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
so one possible idea of of how we can
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
cut property tax and how we can save a
 
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of money would be
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
consolidation of
 
03:05:29.469 --> 03:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
saus um we have over a 100 saus in the
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
state some of them are exceedingly tiny
 
03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
when I whenever I talk to someone from
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
coas County they they never failed to
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
tell me that they have five saus in
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
their County even though the total
 
03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
number of school kids in their county is
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
less than the city of Portsmouth for
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
example so so sius are quite can be
 
03:05:52.349 --> 03:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
quite small they all have a
 
03:05:54.750 --> 03:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent they all have an office
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
they all have so on so the idea is that
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
maybe by consolidating them into larger
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
saus you certainly would have fewer
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
superintendents but you could also maybe
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
get some economies of scale right you
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
know maybe if every one of a bunch of
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
small ones has a grant Rider maybe you
 
03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't need you know if you consolidate
 
03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
10 into one you don't necessarily you
 
03:06:19.630 --> 03:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
need 10 gr grant writers you could maybe
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
get by with a few right that kind of
 
03:06:24.510 --> 03:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
thing so um so we think there could be
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
some some benefits to consolidation and
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
as I I understand it you have you have a
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
couple of different choices of how to go
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
forward with this idea should you choose
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
to one is this bill which is a simple
 
03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee to study it so the difference
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
between a committee and a commission is
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
a committee is is only uh elected
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
officials namely representative and
 
03:06:51.070 --> 03:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
Senators um a commission has also
 
03:06:52.990 --> 03:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
outside people so you you're the next
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill you're going to hear is from
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative lad same sort of idea
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
with a lot more detail but it's a
 
03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
commission so it has many many others
 
03:07:05.229 --> 03:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
that are from outside the um other
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
organizations and so on and you will
 
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
also at some point be getting my bill
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:07:15.750 --> 03:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
765 where I actually wrote the law to do
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
this thing right to to consolidate saus
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
so if you want to sort of skip the
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
committee and study stage and go
 
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
straight to the action that's what my
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
bill is for so so you have a lot of
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
choices coming up and I would just my
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation to you would be at least
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
um not exec any one of these bills until
 
03:07:40.710 --> 03:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard them you've had the public
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
hearing for all for all of them and then
 
03:07:45.389 --> 03:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
think about you know which direction do
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
you want to go if you if you choose to
 
03:07:50.590 --> 03:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
on on any of them and I'm happy to
 
03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:51.790 align:start position:0%
on on any of them and I'm happy to
answer

03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you very much for
 
03:07:54.080 --> 03:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you very much for
pens

03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
pens
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
shating represent Woodcock thank you
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman great afternoon
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
good to see you um is there anything now
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
that precludes a series or multiple seus
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
and doing this on their own I mean the
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
three of us are three different seus is
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
I I haven't seen it precludes us from
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
getting together and say you know what
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
maybe our town should do this yes thank
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative so
 
03:08:21.550 --> 03:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
um saus are controlled by RSA
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
194c and I believe there is a procedure
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
in there that was just adopt came in
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
last term that how for saus to
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
consolidate if if they wish to I think
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
that my own personal opinion is there's
 
03:08:42.229 --> 03:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
probably uh the incentive is not
 
03:08:45.309 --> 03:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily there for the people
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
involved to do this right because
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
certainly if if there's efficiencies
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
people will be losing their jobs and and
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
so I think there'd be a lot of
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
resistance where so that's why sometimes
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
we have to put Force the the issue
 
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.389 --> 03:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
naturally follow there is process
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes that was just passed last
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
time so I I doubt it's been used yet
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
right so yeah represent s
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
how a bill like this is going to impact
 
03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
districts that send their students
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
across state lines we we know we have
 
03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
kids who are at schools in Partnerships
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
with schools in Vermont and in Maine um
 
03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's any going South
 
03:09:36.990 --> 03:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the Border but um I I just don't know
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
how something like this is going to
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate that yes thank you for the
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
question representative um yes there are
 
03:09:47.870 --> 03:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the 104 saus there are two cross
 
03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
school districts one with Vermont one
 
03:09:52.429 --> 03:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
with Maine and in those cases the SAU
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the school district are one and the
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
same right they're they're
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
um is their they um single school
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
district saus and um I had to deal with
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
that in my legislation and my I simply
 
03:10:10.030 --> 03:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
chose to not touch them so they would
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
stay in exactly as they are they're not
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
Consolidated like the others would
 
03:10:20.229 --> 03:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
but it is some this is all again this is
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
a committee that this particular bill is
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
a committee that would study the issue
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
so what the study comes up with is up to
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
them it's just I had to deal with that
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
in my bill and that's what I chose to
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
right yeah thank you uh any further
 
03:10:46.750 --> 03:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions seen none thank you very much
 
03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
questions seen none thank you very much

03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
Hugh good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jerry Fu and
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
I am the associate executive director of

03:11:32.269 --> 03:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
charter school heads as part of our
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
association when I heard chairman
 
03:11:36.110 --> 03:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli yesterday state that there was
 
03:11:39.070 --> 03:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
an intentional effort uh to contain the
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
number of committees and commissions
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
established by this legislature I said
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is music to my ears perhaps we can
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
help chairman cordelli achieve achieve
 
03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:48.309 align:start position:0%
help chairman cordelli achieve achieve
that

03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
goal with all due respect to the bill
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
sponsors and we appreciate the notion of
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
cutting property taxes and containing
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
local expenses in school districts um
 
03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
I'm here to tell you that probably
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent salaries aren't the main
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
drain on that um on that property tax
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
effort but uh I digress on that
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
statement when I first uh saw the
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
proposal it I did find it curious that
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
one of the Bill's sponsors represents a
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
5 town school administrative unit who
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
has two
 
03:12:22.150 --> 03:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh whose citizens have
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
determined that that's the appropriate
 
03:12:26.550 --> 03:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
model for what their five communities
 
03:12:29.710 --> 03:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
desire and uh determine the need for uh
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
in their local area and I think that
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
would be the case in most um in most
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
areas the model of a county
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent may work in some areas of
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
our country but if you lift up the hood
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and Peak underneath you're probably
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to find layers of Bureau
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
Ry and um quite honestly not a lot of
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
savings uh and a lot of confusion and a
 
03:12:57.550 --> 03:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
lack of connection to local communities
 
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
and so we don't feel that that's what
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
Grand estaters want uh out of their
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
superintendant so what does a
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent do
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
anyway the value of a skilled and
 
03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable education a leader in a
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
school system cannot be
 
03:13:16.630 --> 03:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
overstated they're only the ultimate
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
they are not only the ultimate guardians
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer resources they're the
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
Champions for Children Educators and the
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
educational communities that they serve
 
03:13:28.870 --> 03:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
in my 50 years of work in public
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
education including tenur at the middle
 
03:13:33.229 --> 03:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
school high school and systems
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
leadership level I've had the
 
03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to observe and experience
 
03:13:39.070 --> 03:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
educational leadership in a variety of
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
roles I've also had the honor and
 
03:13:43.150 --> 03:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
privilege to serve as an educational
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
leader as a superintendent of
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
schools most people agree when they
 
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
think about it the public education is a
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
public good an overall an essential
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
value that promotes a positive and
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
thriving Community a healthy and
 
03:13:59.550 --> 03:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
evolving economy and a vibrant and
 
03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:00.830 align:start position:0%
evolving economy and a vibrant and
well-informed

03:14:00.830 --> 03:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
well-informed
 
03:14:03.229 --> 03:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
democracy these facts are validated
 
03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
validated in independent studies by
 
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders sociologists education
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
researchers and even political
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
candidates there's no mistaking the
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
important role of public education in
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
our society it is essential and
 
03:14:21.670 --> 03:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
integral but what do school leaders have
 
03:14:23.790 --> 03:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
to do with this public good
 
03:14:27.150 --> 03:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
anyway I would submit a
 
03:14:29.550 --> 03:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
lot the role of the education leader in
 
03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
today's everchanging world can be best
 
03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
described as the CEO of one of the
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
largest employers and service agencies
 
03:14:38.830 --> 03:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
in our economy and certainly one of the
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
largest and most complex organizations
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
in a local community in another way this
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
leadership role can be practically
 
03:14:50.910 --> 03:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
compared to the oldtime juggler on The
 
03:14:53.950 --> 03:14:53.960 align:start position:0%

03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%

03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
vague for representative I I'm looking
 
03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:02.030 align:start position:0%

at

sitting in front of you uh it's the job
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the education leader to make sure
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%

same county in just a few short days how
 
03:16:52.830 --> 03:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
would one superintendent be expected to

deal effectively with all these major

03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility that have been described
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
above the following list specifies a
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the areas of
 
03:17:26.269 --> 03:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility and activities in general
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
leadership maintain an absolute focus on
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
student learning and success act as a
 
03:17:36.189 --> 03:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
CEO for the strategy Vision collaborator
 
03:17:38.590 --> 03:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
consensus building evaluator policy
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
advisor spokesperson and more the
 
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
hearing officer and appeals judge for
 
03:17:46.269 --> 03:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
all disputes by students employees and
 
03:17:49.469 --> 03:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
citizens a legal uh representative for
 
03:17:51.790 --> 03:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
the school district manage school boards
 
03:17:54.070 --> 03:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
relations Associated committee work and
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
task forces and other leadership work
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
for example the superintendent in Conway
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
may have to deal with five or six boards
 
03:18:03.389 --> 03:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
the superintendent in sa6 may have eight
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
or nine boards that they're dealing with
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
along with regional work and even in a
 
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
place like conquer where there's only
 
03:18:11.550 --> 03:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
one school board I checked that
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent schedule this morning
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are 10 night meetings for that
 
03:18:17.950 --> 03:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent for various committees
 
03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
and task forces in the month of January
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
alone that's just night meetings with
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
the school board that has nothing to do
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
with attending some of the athletic
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
events the concerts the curriculum fairs
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
and all by the way that school board has
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
decided that they need a Saturday
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
Retreat on a Saturday in January so
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's part of the work I have a list of
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire education department
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
reports that um superintendents are
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for ifying and uh certifying
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
but there's only 10 minutes left in this
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm not going to read that
 
03:18:55.750 --> 03:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
list of reports because frankly that
 
03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
could take up a majority of the 10
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you but I'm not done sorry
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's more stuff curriculum
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
instruction leading the research and
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
development the what and how how schools
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
work staying current with best education
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
and assessment practices
 
03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
designing professional development for
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
those teachers that you hear about so
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
often in the in the work they need to do
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
personnel management collective
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements at times it's not
 
03:19:26.510 --> 03:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
unusual for for a superintendent to be
 
03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
involved in five six seven collective
 
03:19:30.990 --> 03:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining negotiations in a small
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
several month period to sit at the table
 
03:19:35.070 --> 03:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
to represent the citizens to protect the
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
teachers and to try to come up with
 
03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements that
 
03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
serve the needs of the taxpayers as well
 
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
as the employees um Finance I don't need
 
03:19:46.030 --> 03:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about the the financial
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility that um that they have
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
developing maintaining purchasing and
 
03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:53.429 align:start position:0%
developing maintaining purchasing and
control

03:19:53.429 --> 03:19:53.439 align:start position:0%

03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh pieces area agreements tuition
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
agreements uh those things that once
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
again serve the needs of kids but also
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
protect um and service protection to the
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
local community student services
 
03:20:09.790 --> 03:20:09.800 align:start position:0%

special education service providers and
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard about the the challenges of
 
03:20:26.670 --> 03:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
finding Staffing so you still have to
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
provide those Services somehow you've
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
got to search the best contracts you've
 
03:20:32.550 --> 03:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
got to try
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
to try to balance the needs of kids and
 
03:20:39.070 --> 03:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
the ability of the community to support
 
03:20:42.030 --> 03:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of those kids uring the needs
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
of court plac and Foster home students
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
are addressed ensuring students and
 
03:20:47.950 --> 03:20:47.960 align:start position:0%

03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
Communications and community relations
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
to effectively tell the story of the
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%

03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
respond to those right to no request
 
03:21:10.110 --> 03:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
have effective relations with local
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
public charter schools advise the board
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
on facilities use and and what's
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
happening with the investment of the
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
community to provide an annual report on
 
03:21:20.910 --> 03:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
the actions of all of the schools and
 
03:21:23.389 --> 03:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
what how the school district is
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
functioning for its taxpayers and they
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
should and oh
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that I mention snow days and
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
weather related
 
03:21:34.229 --> 03:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
decisions maintenance and capital
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement you all know your school
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
buildings and your communities are among
 
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the the greatest capital investment um
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
in your communities often times it's the
 
03:21:44.910 --> 03:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the superintendent to
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that those resour those assets
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
are protected that safety precautions
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
are taking place that a HVAC systems are
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
working um and all it takes is listening
 
03:21:58.349 --> 03:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
to a couple of recent uh school board
 
03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
meetings in the city of conquer about
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
what happened to the condition of the
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
Middle School to understand how people
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
feel about
 
03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
um conditions that deteriorate over time
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
due to lack of investment and a
 
03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:22.510 align:start position:0%
due to lack of investment and a
community

03:22:22.510 --> 03:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
like the juggler an education leader
 
03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
never has the satisfaction of spinning
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
just one plate before stopping to begin
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
another rather the work of an SAU leader
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
involves con constantly balancing these
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
comp competing responsibilities these
 
03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
services are not always visible to the
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
public and sometimes go unnoticed
 
03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
especially if they're done well in the
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
past Finance was regarded as the most
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
critical of responsibility however the
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
Advent of new laws regulations
 
03:22:52.710 --> 03:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
expectations generated by the public and
 
03:22:55.070 --> 03:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies have caused an
 
03:22:57.910 --> 03:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
increase of exposure risk financial and
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise for the school organization
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the employers the students and the
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
community in general research tells us a
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
whole lot
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
about strong statistically significant
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
relationship has a positive correlation
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
when there's stable District uh
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
leadership that and that will impact
 
03:23:21.239 --> 03:23:22.870 align:start position:0%

03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
question representative this does not
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
threaten to represent superintendant I
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
believe what it threatens is local
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
control I I I I asked you this is a
 
03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
study committee to see if this is
 
03:24:26.590 --> 03:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
feasible so again I'll ask you a
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
question does this bill say that we want
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
to get rid of superintendent it does not
 
03:24:31.319 --> 03:24:32.830 align:start position:0%
to get rid of superintendent it does not
thank

03:24:32.830 --> 03:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:24:36.189 --> 03:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
you R SEL thank you so much and thank
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I I was a
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
teacher in Maryland which is countywide
 
03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
school districts where we had a
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent with I think it was 12
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
sub assistant superintendents to cover
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
all the different areas because there
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
was an assistant superintendent of
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
English and math and at secondary level
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
Etc as well as various Elementary and
 
03:24:56.110 --> 03:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
special education so is there any
 
03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that doing consolidation of
 
03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent work would in fact save
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
money rather than costing more thank you
 
03:25:03.630 --> 03:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I think
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
you just described what looking under
 
03:25:06.750 --> 03:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
the hood looks
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
like I'm not quite sure that any money
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
would be saved by any District because
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
the jobs still have to be done I don't
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
care if you're Salem Franklin pum B
 
03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
wherever those jobs have to be done and
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
they have to be done with with a touch
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
to the local community I think that's
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
what's different like our members are
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
part of their communities they're part
 
03:25:34.189 --> 03:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
of the rotary they're part of the of
 
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
just a presence like frankly my personal
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
experience one of the greatest
 
03:25:40.110 --> 03:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
satisfactions I had as a superintendent
 
03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
is going to a Friday night football game
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's awesome you get to see the people
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
you get to you're approaching to the
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
people in your community that's the
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
touch that's what New Hampshire wants
 
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
they want to know who their
 
03:25:53.389 --> 03:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent is the superintendents
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
want to know who their employees are who
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
their children
 
03:26:00.269 --> 03:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
are further questions see none thank you
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr
 
03:26:16.750 --> 03:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli good
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee bar
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
Christina from the New Hampshire school
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
boards Association to be clear we're not
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill um if if
 
03:26:26.590 --> 03:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
if if the legislature wants to study
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
something have added and hsba is always
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
available to provide whatever guidance
 
03:26:32.670 --> 03:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
expertise experience and research that
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide I just want to
 
03:26:37.150 --> 03:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of of background about
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
um sort of the the rise of the number of
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
of school administrative units I'll say
 
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years dating myself um I've
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
been with n hsba about 20 years now when
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
I started nsba in 2005 there were there
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
were 84 I believe school administrative
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
units were up to
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
107 um and in my experience um you know
 
03:27:00.189 --> 03:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
in speaking with the school boards that
 
03:27:01.870 --> 03:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
were going through the
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
withdrawals um uh going through the
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process um a lot of the
 
03:27:09.189 --> 03:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
things that Mr fuit just spoke about is
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
why a community wanted to be on their
 
03:27:14.910 --> 03:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
own and wanted to have their own SAU
 
03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted their own Central office and
 
03:27:18.790 --> 03:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
they wanted their own superintendent and
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
they it may have cost them a little bit
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
of money but that District the people in
 
03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
that District the voters in that
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
District decided you know what it may
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
cost us a little bit more money but
 
03:27:30.189 --> 03:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
we're having our own person now we're
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
having our own superintendent rather
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
than having to share that superintendent
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
among two three four seven or eight
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
school districts um so you know it's not
 
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
my job to tell the people in cuden that
 
03:27:44.910 --> 03:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
they can't have their own superintendent
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's not an HSB job to tell the people
 
03:27:49.469 --> 03:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
in Timberlane that they can't have their
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
own superintendent straford Rollinsford
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
is currently purchasing services from s
 
03:27:58.349 --> 03:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
from summersworth they used to be in SAU
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
56 together Rollinsford withdrew from
 
03:28:02.590 --> 03:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
that SAU I want to say maybe 10 years
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
ago and simply turned around and
 
03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:05.910 align:start position:0%
ago and simply turned around and
repurchased

03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
repurchased
 
03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
services from from uh from from
 
03:28:12.550 --> 03:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
summersworth over the course of 10 years
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh Rollinsford currently has an
 
03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
advertisement out they're advertising
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
for their own part-time superintendent
 
03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
because they've decided that we want our
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
own person that we hire we evaluate and
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
we dictate their employment and they're
 
03:28:26.830 --> 03:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
our person then and we can have the
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
school board can manage that individual
 
03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and adopt the policies and tell the
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
people and the board can tell the
 
03:28:35.070 --> 03:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent of Rollinsford what they
 
03:28:37.790 --> 03:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
want for the Rollinsford School District
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
um again so you know it it it's not
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
always the withdrawals were not always
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
about saving money sometimes it was
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
about um having your own person um you
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
know that that that is that is dedicated
 
03:28:52.269 --> 03:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
to your school district and the people
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
in your community um representative
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire did mention um that there was a
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill that passed last session about an
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
incentive and to incentivize
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation of of of saus I forget the
 
03:29:06.550 --> 03:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill number um but basically the
 
03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
consolidation has to occur I believe uh
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
the year 2030 was the deadline so
 
03:29:13.229 --> 03:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's about four or five years for
 
03:29:15.389 --> 03:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
saus to consider this and I believe it
 
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
was an extra $200 um per student um on
 
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
your on uh on your adequa a that you get
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
your state grants obviously that's that
 
03:29:26.110 --> 03:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
bill is only maybe not even 6 months old
 
03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
depending on when the effective date was
 
03:29:30.510 --> 03:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
but um we haven't we haven't you know
 
03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously I I haven't heard of any
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
districts or any saus considering that
 
03:29:37.309 --> 03:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
maybe they will in in in future years I
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
would also be remiss though without um
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
identifying um sort of AJ the position
 
03:29:46.110 --> 03:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
between the two three four bills that we
 
03:29:49.189 --> 03:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
have the session about consolidation of
 
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
school administrative units while
 
03:29:52.990 --> 03:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
comparing and contrasting that with the
 
03:29:55.189 --> 03:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
number of bills that we've had uh in
 
03:29:56.830 --> 03:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
this room the last couple of years
 
03:29:58.150 --> 03:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
seeking to make it easier for
 
03:30:00.990 --> 03:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts to break up
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
sort of you know not consolidating and
 
03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
not perhaps saving costs but letting
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
school districts go out on their own um
 
03:30:09.870 --> 03:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
and yes as the law currently States if a
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
district withdraws if a pre-existing
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
District withdraws from a Cooperative
 
03:30:16.269 --> 03:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
School District they still remain in the
 
03:30:17.870 --> 03:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
existing school administrative unit the
 
03:30:20.269 --> 03:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
same SAU however there is a provision in
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
the law that says the withdrawal from
 
03:30:22.439 --> 03:30:23.150 align:start position:0%
the law that says the withdrawal from
the

03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
co-op and the withdraw from the SAU can
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
occur concurrently and my best guess was
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
that if we see it easier to break up
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
with the co-ops to break up at some
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
point those little districts the little
 
03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
K through 5 elementary school or the k
 
03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
through eight elementary school they're
 
03:30:42.710 --> 03:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to want their own superintendent
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that cin and
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
timberlan and Nottingham and Hill and
 
03:30:50.590 --> 03:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
Goan and Wakefield and Cornish and Cen
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and and all the other districts that
 
03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
have created their own saus over over
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years have have have have
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
have chosen to withdraw so um again
 
03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the bill
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
if the if the legislature wants to study
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
this and hsba is happy to provide
 
03:31:09.309 --> 03:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
information guidance resources but um
 
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know if if if I don't know where all
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
the new people are from on the committee
 
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
I I should I should probably print
 
03:31:16.110 --> 03:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
myself off a little cheat sheet so so I
 
03:31:18.269 --> 03:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
do know but if any of you are in those
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
communities that I that I've listed off
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of minutes talk to
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
your constituents talk to your school
 
03:31:25.710 --> 03:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
boards about why did we withdraw from
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
whatever SAU we were we were we were
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
previously with it's because they wanted
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
those more personalized Services even if
 
03:31:34.110 --> 03:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
it may have cost a little bit more money
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm I'm happy to answer
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any any questions
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative D thank you and thank you
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just I want to
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
know are you aware that some places
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
inherited their they use when other
 
03:31:49.550 --> 03:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
people dropped out and exact my town of
 
03:31:52.510 --> 03:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
planfield left holding the bag when
 
03:31:54.950 --> 03:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
Claremont and I mean know Grandam and
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon left so it wasn't a decision of
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
Our Own It
 
03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
was it just happened that way yeah yeah
 
03:32:03.750 --> 03:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
03:32:05.670 --> 03:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a good point um
 
03:32:07.150 --> 03:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
planfield may not have wanted to
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw from you may have been
 
03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
planfield may have been happy with the
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
arrangement that you had I guess one of
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
the challenges is that and and you know
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've talked about the Cooper withdrawal
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
process and how some individuals and
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
representatives might think that that's
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
burdensome or unfair to the smaller
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
School District the SAU withdrawal
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
process is very very easy you do a study
 
03:32:30.189 --> 03:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
commission the study commission come
 
03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
commission committee a local study
 
03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
committee the study committee comes up
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation and then only that
 
03:32:38.830 --> 03:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
Community votes to withdraw so I I
 
03:32:40.189 --> 03:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
forget what other communities were
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
previously with Playfield but you but um
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know the Cornish was one issue one
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
gr and leanon gram okay so when Grantham
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to withdraw it was only the
 
03:32:51.870 --> 03:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
people in Grantham voting to withdraw
 
03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
from that SAU and when Lebanon wanted to
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw it was only the the voters so
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
the SAU withdrawal process is very very
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
easy if that Community wants to withdraw
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
from the SAU they withdraw and planfield
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
has no say in that so this may be
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit cart before the
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
horse but you know a recommendation
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
might be to if there was a study
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
commission um you know tightening up the
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
the process for withdrawal um maybe a
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
moratorium on sa withdrawals we've seen
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
moratoriums with building Aid previously
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
um the State Board put a moratorium on
 
03:33:26.229 --> 03:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
appr proving Charter Schools maybe 15 or
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
so years ago um when the state basically
 
03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
did not have any money for to approve
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
new charter schools so again that's sort
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
of getting cart before the horse but
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
there there may be some ideas but you
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
know the one Super One superintendent
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
per county is you know you can see where
 
03:33:45.150 --> 03:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
my predilections would be but um anyway
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:33:46.439 --> 03:33:48.309 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah R
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
fre thank you Mr chair and it's so nice
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
to see you again you as well two
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives you have n have known
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
each other for a few years um I do have
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
a question for you you do know that I
 
03:34:02.469 --> 03:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
was on the Manchester School Board um
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
and I i' I've heard some scenarios
 
03:34:06.630 --> 03:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
worked up about how the superintendent
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
has a long list of items well one of the
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
things that I've observed and you have
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
as well working with the Manchester
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
school district is the number of support
 
03:34:18.030 --> 03:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
staff that are in the superintendent's
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
office do you have any idea how many
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
positions are in just the Manchester
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
School District as far as support for
 
03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
the superintendent thank you for the
 
03:34:28.110 --> 03:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know the Staffing in
 
03:34:30.269 --> 03:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I imagine it's quite
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
significant though well I I I actually
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
counted it I just a rough guesstimate
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's about 30 positions in um in the sa
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
office to support the superintendent and
 
03:34:44.670 --> 03:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up thank you um and do
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know of how many open superintendent
 
03:34:49.189 --> 03:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
positions we have in the state right now
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
I I anecdotally I think there're about
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
seven or eight don't quote me on that
 
03:34:55.870 --> 03:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
though in any given year 10 is about
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
average I'd say we've had some years
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
where there have been as few as five or
 
03:35:01.710 --> 03:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
six and again anecdotally we've had
 
03:35:03.389 --> 03:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
years there was a year I forget I think
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
it was preco we had one year there were
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
like 20 25 openings across the state
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
typical I'd say would be about 10 per
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
year right and we know how difficult it
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
is to find superintendent it can be yes
 
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
yes it can be so I want to thank thank
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
you um for answering my questions thank
 
03:35:21.630 --> 03:35:21.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:31.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%

representative

03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
lad thank you very much representative
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
Cordell for the record my name is Rick
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
lad I come from hail New
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh I'm here today to
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 292 which is a bill that
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
establishes a commission to study the
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
saus on the way back down the hallway
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
I've heard some of the discussion on the
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
previous bill so I'll try not to
 
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
replicate what had been said there um
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh at this whole issue a a little bit
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
differently than those where we're
 
03:37:18.990 --> 03:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to go right out and
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
consolidate into one per per per County
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
I can tell you right now in gron county
 
03:37:30.189 --> 03:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
that won't work Littleton and hail will
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
not agree to what's going on in Lebanon
 
03:37:32.160 --> 03:37:32.830 align:start position:0%
not agree to what's going on in Lebanon
and

03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hanover and Lebanon and Hanover control
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
the vote uh so uh it would just create a
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
firestorm up in my rule neck of the
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
woods but there are some things which we
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
need to look at in terms of the
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
consolidation of these 107 saus which we
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
have and it's something we can't negate
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
or not do we need to take this healthy
 
03:37:59.790 --> 03:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
look at looking at what are the costs
 
03:38:02.429 --> 03:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
are there any efficiencies which we can
 
03:38:06.670 --> 03:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
gu gain out of this um we do know that
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are only two other locations in
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
this country that hire have higher
 
03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
administrative costs not principal ships
 
03:38:17.309 --> 03:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
administrative costs than this State per
 
03:38:18.389 --> 03:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
per per
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
capita and that is Missouri and it's not
 
03:38:24.389 --> 03:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
a state Washington
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
DC and
 
03:38:29.630 --> 03:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
so maybe there's something we can do to
 
03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
look at this as you recall on the
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee last year we had a bill HB
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
1450 and maybe it's the year before but
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
it all runs together that was the bill
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
which we initially had is the
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the two systems
 
03:38:43.150 --> 03:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
community college system and University
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire
 
03:38:50.590 --> 03:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
we had a very effective study shared by
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh Mr
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
applebe which looked at this with
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives on it Senators on it and
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
other people coming in from other angles
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
commission and we recognized that
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
consolidation to the one system with all
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
the governance issues with all the
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreement agree issues with
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
the mission statements the culture of
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
higher education in the state needing
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
seven community colleges which are
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
independent from the University system
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
but also link though in many ways plat
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
it we need to communicate with it
 
03:39:30.349 --> 03:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
transferability of credit we need to do
 
03:39:32.110 --> 03:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at things to be
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
more affordable more accessible to our
 
03:39:37.870 --> 03:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
students and so the issue of
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
consolidation of
 
03:39:41.550 --> 03:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
saus maybe there's some things we can
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
look at and and maybe some things we can
 
03:39:44.279 --> 03:39:46.269 align:start position:0%
look at and and maybe some things we can
learn

03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
learn
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
um going down here um the literature I
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
read is that you don't go through a
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
process like this just because things
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
are higher costing right now for example
 
03:40:01.469 --> 03:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
we we see some tremendous jumps in cost
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
of doing education in the state in 2000
 
03:40:04.479 --> 03:40:05.870 align:start position:0%
of doing education in the state in 2000
to

03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
2023 our enrollment declined by
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
23% a
 
03:40:13.870 --> 03:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
quarter and
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
our cost per pupil jumped by
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
81.6% other words we jump from
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
$1,192 per pupil to over $20,000 323 in
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
2023 so we jump from 11 to 23 uh 20
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
$20,000 that's a huge jump and we know
 
03:40:40.030 --> 03:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't think there's many people
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
here in communities where you're not
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
shouting about assessed property values
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
and yes our state relies upon that as
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
one of our Revenue
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
sources uh for Education there's a
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
number of them that that's not what this
 
03:40:59.070 --> 03:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee is about so let's look for a
 
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
second some of the possible outcomes
 
03:41:05.070 --> 03:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
that could come from uh shared services
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
Maybe by districts coming together saus
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about I'm not talking about
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
the Local District the
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
seus we might be able to improve
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
transportation services
 
03:41:19.469 --> 03:41:19.479 align:start position:0%
Information Technology security special
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
education services some districts don't
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
have that service the way the
 
03:41:25.229 --> 03:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
neighboring service may have it so is
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
there a way of sharing that I know that
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh Speech Pathology services in the town
 
03:41:34.189 --> 03:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
of Warren which is one of my towns is
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
coming by way of online services from
 
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
California because we cannot afford the
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
cost of a speech therapist or they're
 
03:41:47.070 --> 03:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
not available for a small school that's
 
03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:48.389 align:start position:0%
not available for a small school that's
100

03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
100
 
03:41:50.910 --> 03:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
students Legal Services could be shared
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
Food Services could be shared uh
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum development and Prof
 
03:41:56.670 --> 03:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
professional development time well
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be wonderful if there's
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
something going in District a over here
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
and District B over here and you're in
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
District B but you love to gain
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
information about what's going on in
 
03:42:08.469 --> 03:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
District a so you could share that
 
03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
development for for staff we could
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
better coordinate some of our curricular
 
03:42:14.910 --> 03:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
areas like mathematics which we need to
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
work on in the state now we're trying to
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
do that through math learning
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
communities but this is one area where
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
we could do in K through 12 and and uh
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
so Human Resources I won't go on anymore
 
03:42:27.550 --> 03:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot more things that could
 
03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:28.590 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot more things that could
be

03:42:28.590 --> 03:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes there are some issues which are
 
03:42:37.630 --> 03:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
going to hamper going into uh uh uh one
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
large SAU like Hawaii or or going into
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
ones by counties which have been
 
03:42:44.520 --> 03:42:46.910 align:start position:0%
ones by counties which have been
proposed

03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
I see one of the biggest issues besides
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreements and contracts and
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
all that which you've heard about
 
03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
already is culture culture Within These
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
communities when you talk about the
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
little town of permont in my community
 
03:43:02.429 --> 03:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
03:43:06.030 --> 03:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
district coming to hail for elementary
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
school they're saying wow we're going to
 
03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
lose our community center we're going to
 
03:43:13.710 --> 03:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
lose the school which houses our 68 kids
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
that are k through eight we're going to
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
lose our K through 8 program but then
 
03:43:20.910 --> 03:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
the other side of side saying
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
saying but your eighth grade and 7eventh
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
grade only have three or four or five
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
kids in each of those levels what kind
 
03:43:28.990 --> 03:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
of social experience are they getting
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
are they getting what holl middle school
 
03:43:31.279 --> 03:43:32.030 align:start position:0%
are they getting what holl middle school
can

03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
provide but we don't want to lose our
 
03:43:40.030 --> 03:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
school um it goes on and on um so I I I
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
guess what I would like to say by doing
 
03:43:44.070 --> 03:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing here that we have a
 
03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:46.110 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing here that we have a
commission

03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
study there's some validity to doing
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
this the study we had in 1450 which
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
started out as a consolidation study it
 
03:43:56.590 --> 03:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
came up how we going to align some of
 
03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
those horrendous issues that we're
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with on the university community
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
college levels and now we have quarterly
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
reports coming back to us from the
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
chancellors of both schools in fact
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
we'll have another one here in another
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
three weeks or
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
so how can we improve well we came out
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
with the task force of a number of short
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
term initiatives and long-term
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
initiatives to enhance higher education
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of them Dr Don Burks is already
 
03:44:25.469 --> 03:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
imposed at at Plymouth State going to a
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
three-year bachelor degree for six
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
different subject areas which is a great
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
idea because that is an affordability
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
issue and it's also one that gets people
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
out into these career areas through a
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
pathway that's as quicker you know you
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
know I of course I never really was a
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
lover of reading Shakespeare but you
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
know shakes exp is necessary to have in
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
the Collegiate level you need to have
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
that experience available to all the
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
students who want to have that type of
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
experience but it's not necessary if
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to go off and become a
 
03:44:56.479 --> 03:44:58.149 align:start position:0%
you're going to go off and become a
mechanical

03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
mechanical
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
engineer uh you need to learn some of
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
those other things so getting back to
 
03:45:04.590 --> 03:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
where we are right
 
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
here in the year 2023 there were a
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
number of states that took the
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
initiative to have some kind of a uh
 
03:45:15.309 --> 03:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
consolidation study done they went from
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
Arkansas to Illinois to Massachusetts to
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
Michigan North Carolina New Hampshire
 
03:45:24.269 --> 03:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire here we had HB 1579
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
as you may recall and representative
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli was involved with that
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
pre-existing saus May merge
 
03:45:33.870 --> 03:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
administrative office offices to include
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
Personnel merger grants were awarded for
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
those that would would decide to go that
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh Direction up to $200 per pupil for
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
the first two years so gave some kind of
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
a carrot or some kind of assistance to
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
help move in that
 
03:45:52.110 --> 03:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
direction I don't know I don't think
 
03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
anybody's grabbed a hold of that uh but
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
that was a concept that was out there
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
available uh Oregon Pennsylvania South
 
03:46:01.229 --> 03:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
Carolina Tennessee Vermont Washington
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin and Wisconsin all all got
 
03:46:07.469 --> 03:46:07.479 align:start position:0%
involved with in 2024 Kentucky New
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
Jersey and West Virginia went down that
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
road I want to take a moment and speak
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
to what happened in
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont cuz I get up in the morning I
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
look across my deck Across The Meadows
 
03:46:19.990 --> 03:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
below me and I look right in the v ront
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
and representative Dr you probably do a
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
very similar thing down where you're
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
living Vermont acts 153 156 and
 
03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
notorious act
 
03:46:33.510 --> 03:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
46 uh they also had a bill HB
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
385 that was a bill that was in their
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
house which attempted to move toward a
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
single Statewide School District similar
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
to Hawaii it's
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
fail the other act 46 has not resulted
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
in a corresponding decrease decrease in
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
pure per pupil spending in districts
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
that have Consolidated or emerged but it
 
03:47:01.349 --> 03:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
has linked into communities K through 12
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities many of these smaller
 
03:47:04.510 --> 03:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
districts were
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
k8s and they were small but they in
 
03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
talking if we were to talk to some of
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
the people that were superintendents
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
over there or school board members and
 
03:47:16.149 --> 03:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
IAB one of those individuals was
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
superintendent of
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
sau23 went over and took care of Orange
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
County he came back said Rick it's
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
costing us a lot of money there were
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
some real positive things that came out
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
of it though and I would like to just
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
highlight some of those things where a
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
commission could net us some
 
03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
gains Cooperative purchasing
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
agreements that's one of the things
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's come out of the community college
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
system in University system why should
 
03:47:48.429 --> 03:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
we be purchasing things separately not
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
using the same technology can we do that
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
on a wider scope not for just SAU one
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
two or three but for you know getting
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
together and doing it in a larger scope
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think there is an efficiency there
 
03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's a gain um combine Financial
 
03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
Services budget
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
management there are some districts
 
03:48:09.550 --> 03:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
which are very very small and if you
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
look at the research and I took some
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
time to do the research on this one
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
there are smaller districts perhaps AB
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
budding each other which would
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
gain by moving together similar cultures
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
right beside each other different things
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
offered in these school districts but
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
you combined it you might be able to get
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
some shared
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
resources and you and have a singular
 
03:48:37.830 --> 03:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
budget director manager that's a
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
game um when you have a school district
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
the size of some of our small ones C
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
Pont under 100
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
kids um that is expensive and it's also
 
03:48:53.870 --> 03:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
hard for them to find the Personnel to
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
work in their
 
03:48:57.910 --> 03:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
schools Warren had to go chase down a
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist in California and do
 
03:49:03.149 --> 03:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
it online that doesn't heck help a kid
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's in K12 trying to learn how to say
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
R you know or articulation issues and I
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
often times say they do that anyways in
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so what's wrong with it uh
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced roles and opportunity for
 
03:49:19.229 --> 03:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
shared Educational Services in districts
 
03:49:21.070 --> 03:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
and when you do that across lines you
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
can you can save Ser uh share those
 
03:49:28.590 --> 03:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
education um you could have shared
 
03:49:34.189 --> 03:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum perhaps and and that's what
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to sort of do like when we
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
get the curriculum learning program
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
going communities we bring them to
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
everybody together but we're trying to
 
03:49:43.229 --> 03:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
get a similar program going so we have
 
03:49:45.550 --> 03:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
the same benchmarks and we have the same
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
expectations meeting the same standards
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
but we also have the flexibility within
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
to reach out to those students have
 
03:49:53.950 --> 03:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
different learning styles than others
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
and there's different teaching styles
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
that have to pair all those learning
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
styles um professional development can
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
be a winner um now in looking at when we
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
did the cons uh um the
 
03:50:07.439 --> 03:50:09.550 align:start position:0%
did the cons uh um the
consolidation

03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
um oh now let me talk about this one
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
here knowledge communicated to all
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
within a large District from saus Office
 
03:50:19.229 --> 03:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
often times is more effective when I
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
chaired the commission on public school
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's Homeland Security
 
03:50:25.229 --> 03:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
where Security Access
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
Communications all that money available
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
up to $100,000 per school when we
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
reached out to the smaller districts
 
03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
some of those small districts didn't
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
even know there was such a grant out
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
there now why don't they know is it
 
03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
because they're superintendent maybe
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's on a contractual basis there may
 
03:50:49.149 --> 03:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
maybe every other week um because you
 
03:50:50.910 --> 03:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
they have a superintendent contracted
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent with a larger one next
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
door um can't afford to have a full-time
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent and doesn't make much
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
sense if you're just a school of 100
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
kids but those schools have security
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
issues also they need that
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
information and uh that's just one
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
example right there Creer technical
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
education we last year allocated four
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
million two years ago in our B in budget
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
$2 million per year
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh grant money for transportation above
 
03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
and beyond the $9 million which we
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
allocate annually again I asked CTE
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
directors and uh represent Cornell
 
03:51:31.870 --> 03:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with this process that
 
03:51:34.510 --> 03:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
how many people out there in the weeds
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the rural areas urban areas actually
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
knew about this money is
 
03:51:41.950 --> 03:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
available if you're
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
beyond and and up to several weeks ago
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
out of that 4 million we only spent
 
03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:49.269 align:start position:0%
out of that 4 million we only spent
about

03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
2.5 some are not accessing these things
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
because the knowledge hasn't been
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
imparted with a larger operation going
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
on it's possible that that communication
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
could be disseminated by the
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent through the staff working
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
and get out rather than having to rely
 
03:52:09.469 --> 03:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
upon these small districts where a lot
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
of that support's not available they're
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
meeting the legislative law the statute
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
but are they getting the service that
 
03:52:17.630 --> 03:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
they really need uh
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
so lastly in looking at this
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
commission I have no loyalty to the
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
makeup of the commission at all I would
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
like to see if there's going to be a
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
commission study at all that we put
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
people on it that are really
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable of what the structure and
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
organization of the state looks like and
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
there is there any areas where we could
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
consolidate maybe those smaller
 
03:52:44.830 --> 03:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
districts we got to do something we
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
cannot continue to be paying out on
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
average just for the superintendent
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
alone somewhere between $150
 
03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
$160,000 local districts are not going
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue doing
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
that and so is there any way we can
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate in some areas I'm not
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
advocating that we have one per County I
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
I just think that is we have too many
 
03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
school districts that cross
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
lines um and there there there are so
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
many issues so looking at the makeup of
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
that commission if you see folks which
 
03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
could be an asset if you want to go
 
03:53:21.750 --> 03:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
forward with some kind of study we've
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
had studies before we've had studies in
 
03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
the community college system and the
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
university system before this one worked
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
we are getting reports back and we're
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
seeing what we have to do to get these
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
efficiencies to scale in place I do
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
believe we need efficiencies to scale we
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
do need to look at the organization
 
03:53:45.389 --> 03:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
structure in this state
 
03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
and yes um uh Mr Barrett Christina is
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
correct we did uh allow one District to
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
split up this last year but there was a
 
03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
lot of real reasons for that and some of
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
them were very very solid reasons but
 
03:54:02.189 --> 03:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's not the answer in our school
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
building Aid what have we done one of
 
03:54:06.189 --> 03:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
the conditions for getting School B
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid is
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
consolidation we're going to have to our
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
demographics don't allow us to continue
 
03:54:16.189 --> 03:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
funding everything we're doing we got to
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
really take the initiative and just
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
because it may have failed some places
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
some places it's working a little bit a
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
little bit's good for us
 
03:54:28.269 --> 03:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
even so that's why I'm advocating a
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
commission rather than the other thank
 
03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and take any
 
03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
 
03:54:36.439 --> 03:54:38.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
representative

03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
lad seeing none thank you very much
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%

thank you very much uh next up is Doris
oy

03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman cordelli members of
 
03:54:56.910 --> 03:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Dar heny a former
 
03:54:59.550 --> 03:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
School Board member from NASA I think a
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
review of the superintendent duties will
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
be useful there's 21 that I found in RSA
 
03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
194 F4 the New Hampshire District system
 
03:55:09.630 --> 03:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
was created in 1805 for the purpose of
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
raising money to build schools and give
 
03:55:13.510 --> 03:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
residents a right to vote in District
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
affairs that was local control parents
 
03:55:19.149 --> 03:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
were able to squit school districts by
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
notifying the town clerk on the
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
education portion of their property
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
taxes was Reed to their new District
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
that was public school choice these
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
grammar schools taught Reading Writing
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
and arithmetic families provided the
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
textbooks except for the poor they were
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
provided by the town these were free
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
schools in addition to private schools
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
andies the state then decided to create
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
saus by offering a little extra money to
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
consolidate at the time there over over
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
3,000 school districts and the state
 
03:55:48.189 --> 03:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
decided that consolidation would save
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
money so here we go again reducing the
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
number of superintendent centralizes
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
control on even a larger number of
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
districts can make it more difficult for
 
03:55:59.630 --> 03:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
parents to have a genuine voice in the
 
03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
education of their children this is
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
especially important when parents
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with the superintendent and
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
trust me disagreements happen the loss
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
of local control Abate aggravates
 
03:56:12.349 --> 03:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
parents saving money isn't the only
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
consideration if it's truly C savings a
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
detailed accounting of all federal funds
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
and mandates will be extremely helpful
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
even school board members don't get
 
03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
complete information on this topic
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
superintendents are required to oversee
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
compliance with state and federal
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
mandates so dig down some mandates are
 
03:56:31.510 --> 03:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
timec consuming invasive of privacy
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
others just ineffective towards student
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes it might not be coste effective
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
to accept funding in exchange for
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
implementing certain mandates if you
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
review the tasks of the superintendent
 
03:56:45.309 --> 03:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
please review each task in New Hampshire
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
we spend 4 billion 8.4% comes from
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
federal aid that's roughly 3 336 million
 
03:56:54.910 --> 03:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
for this our public schools are busting
 
03:56:56.670 --> 03:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
budgets raising property taxes
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
implementing costly Federal mandates and
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
hiring endless
 
03:57:02.590 --> 03:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
administrators even if we're
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
entertaining the now we're entertaining
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
you the efas to bailout students from
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
public schools that are considered
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
unsuitable or unsafe so we're going in
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
two directions there's considerable
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
savings to be had if we eliminate
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance systems we might not
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
need so many efas restore local control
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
and get the federal monkey off our backs
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
under the membership section of this
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill there are two members from the New
 
03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association I'd
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
ask that you give a add two members from
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
the school district's governance
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
Association this is another very active
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide group for school board members
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time
 
03:57:40.640 --> 03:57:52.110 align:start position:0%

03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
Banfield such a strange
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
chair it is um Amry Banfield uh I've
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
been parental rights advocate in New
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on be and focused on
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
excellence and education for probably
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
about 20 years I think uh represent
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
sentive lad you're probably the only one
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
in this room that's been around longer
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
than I have um I do support this because
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to study the situation uh
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
there's some things that representative
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
lad brought up I'm not sure I would want
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
it for my school uh this curriculum
 
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
sharing I I do like the idea of you know
 
03:58:37.389 --> 03:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
each School making sure that but as long
 
03:58:41.229 --> 03:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
as it's you know um voluntary so be
 
03:58:44.110 --> 03:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
it in districts across New Hampshire
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
there is a trend that is not going
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
unnoticed by taxpayers too enrollment in
 
03:58:50.830 --> 03:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
public schools is going down but School
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
budgets are going up there are many
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
factors for this trend but one of those
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
factors is the administrative budgets
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
even with school administrators cutting
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
teachers based on enrollment numbers the
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
budgets continue to climb in my own
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
District which is sa 21 we added an
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
added an assistant superintendent just a
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
few years ago now we have a
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent and two assistant
 
03:59:20.590 --> 03:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents and if you look at their
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
salaries you will see that most of these
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
administrators make more than the
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
governor the attorney general and the
 
03:59:30.269 --> 03:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education in the state
 
03:59:32.189 --> 03:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
if you go through their salaries you're
 
03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to find
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone I don't know if it's
 
03:59:38.189 --> 03:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
everyone so just to be clear on
 
03:59:43.229 --> 03:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
that uh what they do in business is they
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
look at this all the time how can we
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
consolidate and again I know that this
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
is a little different than consolidation
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
but ups for instance they're constantly
 
03:59:56.070 --> 03:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
looking at uh they they they combine
 
03:59:58.269 --> 03:59:58.279 align:start position:0%
districts they they you know they need
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
drivers to deliver their packages and
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
they'll take out drivers if they don't
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
have enough packages but this happens in
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
business all the time I don't think that
 
04:00:08.189 --> 04:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
it should be a problem that we're
 
04:00:10.469 --> 04:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
looking at whether or not this is the
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
most efficient way for saus to operate
 
04:00:16.990 --> 04:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh Northampton where I live our
 
04:00:24.149 --> 04:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
budget for the the amount that we pay to
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.950 --> 04:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
$284,000 our cost per pupil in
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
Northampton which is in elementary and
 
04:00:34.750 --> 04:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
in middle school is
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
$339,000 per student that is not the
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
state number that is the actual number
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's what it costs for us living in
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to educate our kids in
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
Northampton that's a shocking number
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
say within SAU 21 we have cab Brook they
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
will go to the polls in March and decide
 
04:01:01.550 --> 04:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
SAU they just to put it mildly the this
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
has this school SE Brook has become very
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
contentious um that is why they're
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
SAU the students in C Brook are scoring
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
around 30% in math and uh I have spoken
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
before the seab Brook School Board I
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
have looked at what they're using in the
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
classroom I have looked at their
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum I've looked at their pedagogi
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
I've looked at everything and I've
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
brought them some additional
 
04:01:40.349 --> 04:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
information but if they withdraw this is
 
04:01:42.349 --> 04:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
going to put
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
another amount on the rest of us in seu
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
21 the costs are going up how do we fix
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I'm not telling you
 
04:01:56.149 --> 04:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
that I have the answers but a study
 
04:01:57.630 --> 04:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
committee these study committees that
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
are being proposed I'm glad that they're
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
proposing them there's one in in the
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
Senate too we have got to look at ways
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
we have got to look at what's going on
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
in these administrative
 
04:02:08.040 --> 04:02:10.550 align:start position:0%
in these administrative
units

04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
units
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
um we need strong public schools with
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
good teachers per professionals and
 
04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
principes if they need an extra
 
04:02:18.750 --> 04:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
administrator in the school to cover
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
some of the duties at the SAU level that
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
would still be able that would still be
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
a reduction for taxpayers and for um
 
04:02:27.439 --> 04:02:31.349 align:start position:0%
a reduction for taxpayers and for um
administrative

04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.830 --> 04:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
costs we looked at cutting $65,000 from
 
04:02:38.110 --> 04:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
the fire budget fire fighter budget uh
 
04:02:41.149 --> 04:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
because of the budgets going up in our
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
town $65,000 the fire Chief came and
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
spoke to us and said that if that
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
happens the fire chief and the deputy
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
fire chief would have to cover two days
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
a week two days a week out of 52 weeks
 
04:02:58.110 --> 04:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
that they would have to cover for
 
04:03:00.830 --> 04:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters in Northampton and the
 
04:03:02.590 --> 04:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
reason I bring you that is because when
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this we're looking at
 
04:03:06.990 --> 04:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
okay we have a fire budget we have a
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
town budget we have all these budgets
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if one goes up where are the
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
teachers in all of this the teachers cuz
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing their salaries above what
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's making I'm not seeing you
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
know these are the people are in the
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
classroom they're the people impacting
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
the kids and so when I look at a company
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
like UPS saying you know we're going to
 
04:03:27.760 --> 04:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
like UPS saying you know we're going to
be

04:03:28.630 --> 04:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
efficient I think our schools need to be
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
efficient too I want to make sure that
 
04:03:35.790 --> 04:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
we have enough teachers covering the
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
students and and and anytime a budget's
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
cut where do they go oh we're going to
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
get rid of teachers that's the threat
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
not we're going to bring our salaries in
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
line at the SAU level to where it's more
 
04:03:53.550 --> 04:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
you know what you would consider maybe
 
04:03:53.560 --> 04:03:55.950 align:start position:0%
you know what you would consider maybe
Fair

04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
Fair
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
um so this is why I support these bills
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
I I'm only going to speak once on them I
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
didn't speak on the one that was prior
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
to this SAU administrators are going to
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
certainly object they're certainly going
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
to object this is what we do I'm sure
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
that there's probably managers at UPS
 
04:04:17.830 --> 04:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
that were like wait a second you can't
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
it it happens they consolidate they
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate and that's what happens in
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
the business world and so I think the
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
most important people in school are our
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
teachers and our pair of professionals
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not afraid to say it I will say it
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that when it comes to these
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
costs going up we've got to start
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
looking at these budgets
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not seeing outof control
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
salaries for teachers but when I look at
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
the salaries for our sa people and I'm
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
looking at why do we add a second
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent assistant superintendent
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
in our
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
district I mean really that's that's
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
that's why I support this so support
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
these bills that are coming before you
 
04:05:01.870 --> 04:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:05:01.880 --> 04:05:02.950 align:start position:0%

04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
get started again
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh the next and last bill of the day is
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
HB 131 requiring school boards to
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
develop and enact policies regarding
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone use in
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
schools and um since this is
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative lad day uh he's uh back
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
at the microphone uh to introduce this
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
official good afternoon folks uh
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and folks of the of
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
the committee I appreciate your kind
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
comment I think I've learned my lesson
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't write so many darn bills um uh but
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
today I I I'm here uh presenting a bill
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
which this one I feel very very strongly
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
on uh this bill is HP 131 requiring
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
School boards to develop and enact
 
04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
policies regarding personal cell phone
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
use in schools and when someone sits
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
down to write legislation like that you
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
have to always have in your mind at
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
least I did in the back of my mind where
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
does State vers local end up on this
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
thing where can I say this is going to
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
be a policy that we hope that everybody
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
follows through the state but am I
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
intruding upon the responsibility of the
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
local school board that's a a point that
 
04:12:11.229 --> 04:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
I think that runs through this bill
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
however as a state
 
04:12:17.070 --> 04:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
we are tasked with the
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility and our mission to ensure
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
that all students have the opportunity
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
to receive an adequate
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
education that all students leave our
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
high schools career
 
04:12:34.830 --> 04:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
ready and that means going on to
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
postsecondary school going on to a
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful job going on to one of the
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
military branches going on to the job of
 
04:12:44.189 --> 04:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
your liking and with the skills and the
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge that you've been given and
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
provided with while you were in uh
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
school so now I'm reflecting a little
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
bit back on some of the early types of
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh elements that come from
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
policies back in the
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
1980s so I'm dating myself I started
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
education after I came home from
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
overseas in Southeast Asia in
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
1969 and then went into school and
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
became this teacher which I thoroughly
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
enjoyed I had to live because I wasn't
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
getting paid enough and and so that
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
issue was there but we had this issue we
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
called time on
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
task so that's nothing new time spent in
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
school is not always spent in the
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
classrooms and time spent in classrooms
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
is not always spent actively
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
learning we know that
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
you can go in and observe what's going
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
on in a school and get a good feel for a
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
school by looking at some of the
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
classrooms and seeing what's going
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
on time and how it is spent time and
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
task as we call it may well be a
 
04:14:00.510 --> 04:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
variable that makes the difference for
 
04:14:03.870 --> 04:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
students can cell phone use impact time
 
04:14:09.389 --> 04:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
on task unequivocally yes it can and it
 
04:14:12.189 --> 04:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
does the amount of time spent actually
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh on learning TX varies greatly from
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
school to school and from classroom to
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
classroom a study done Years Ago by the
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
Michigan State University found that
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
students in one classroom spent a total
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
of in this in elementary school 84
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
minutes a day on
 
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
reading but their peers in another
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
classroom just down the hall spent only
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
24 minutes a day on the
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
subject well which classroom do you
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
think had the best performance
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
allocate allocated time the time you
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
have for something is often beyond the
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
teachers ability to control it's set up
 
04:14:52.510 --> 04:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
by the schedule within the school
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
whether you're block scheduling or if
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's a grade school but you know you
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
have uh a teacher prep period coming up
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
whether the music teachers coming in or
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
PE or you got to go to library or
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
recesses right around the bench so we
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
have to you know allocate our scheduling
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
around these designs set up by the
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
systemwide years and years
 
04:15:17.309 --> 04:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
go we had within Statute in the state
 
04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
and over in Maine where I started out
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
designated minutes per subject per day
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
per week but we've gotten away from that
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
since now many subjects override in the
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
other subject by thematic reading and
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
and thematic learning all
 
04:15:32.760 --> 04:15:36.229 align:start position:0%
and thematic learning all
that

04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
um when teachers give a great deal of
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
their time and attention to only certain
 
04:15:42.239 --> 04:15:43.630 align:start position:0%
their time and attention to only certain
students

04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
time on task engaged time versus the
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
allocated time an academic achievement
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
for the whole class take a
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
dive now let's get to the business of
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
this thing we see everybody doing this
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know business with the cell phone
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know you can walk anywhere nowadays
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and see it whether you're walking into a
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
waiting room at a
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
hospital you can look around and see
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
everybody waiting what are they doing
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the cell phone what
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
are they doing is they're watch walking
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
down the hallway of a school now used to
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
be it was a great social experience kids
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
were yanking around with each other
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
having fun talking to each other looking
 
04:16:23.790 --> 04:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
at the whites of the eyes now what are
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
they looking at the white of the cell
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
phone they're looking at that cell phone
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
all the time and that I believe and I'm
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
not a doctor not a physician but I hear
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
from my folks saying when I go to
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock that we're getting more and
 
04:16:42.389 --> 04:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
more kids in here that have these
 
04:16:46.109 --> 04:16:46.119 align:start position:0%
physical issues either they bend over or
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're getting this stuff coming on
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
their cell phones and getting into the
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
mental emotional issues when they're
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
getting bullied or that stuff's coming
 
04:16:58.030 --> 04:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
on or they're looking at pornography or
 
04:16:59.950 --> 04:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
something on those cell
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
phones which is really absorbing them
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it's taking them in the wrong
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
direction I am concerned about cell
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
phone use in the classroom or in in
 
04:17:12.080 --> 04:17:13.550 align:start position:0%
phone use in the classroom or in in
schools

04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation have before you allows
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
some discretion though it says use
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
during classroom
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
instruction that's the part when I'm
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
teaching my math class or I'm teaching
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
about the history of New Hampshire I
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
want those eyeballs where they should be
 
04:17:32.189 --> 04:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
I don't want them looking down or
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
feeling the thing buzzing in their
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
pocket I don't want them looking down to
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
see who's communicating with them that's
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's ofas behavior and off task
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
behavior is not learning behavior in
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
terms of what is being taught the
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
content how do we control that teachers
 
04:17:55.389 --> 04:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
have tried teachers believe me they're
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
trying to control
 
04:18:01.109 --> 04:18:01.119 align:start position:0%
this however it's bigger now and it has
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
to come either from the system office
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
the school board or it's going to have
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
to come through some statutory
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
language 72% of high school teachers
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
said students being distracted by cell
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
phones is a major
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
problem that was uh came out education
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
next in 20125 so that's just reason
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
article 72% of high school teachers say
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
problem when students can readily slip a
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
phone out during class and access the
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
entire internet does that not discourage
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
them from doing the hard work of
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
learning content again another article
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
in the paper at at least 14 states have
 
04:18:46.510 --> 04:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
passed laws or enacted policies that ban
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
or restrict students use of cell phones
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
in schools Statewide or recommend local
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
districts enact their own bans or
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
restricted policies education week you
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
know many of us receive education week I
 
04:19:00.269 --> 04:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
always received it we I still try to get
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
it and it it's states include Arizona
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
Alabama Indiana Florida Delaware
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Minnesota Louisiana
 
04:19:09.070 --> 04:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Oklahoma Ohio South
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
Carolina Washington and
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
Virginia so what does this mean if we
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a policy which I'm
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
recommending here where they're not used
 
04:19:21.790 --> 04:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
during instruction but there are
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions in this bill right here there
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
are exceptions for
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
that there are times when I know there's
 
04:19:31.349 --> 04:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
certain content areas where an
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
instructor may say we need to use cell
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
phones to access this information or we
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
need this cell phone to access what's
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
going on in this trade that you're
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
getting into that you like to get into
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
and work with that
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
Association that to me if the cell
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
phone's out with the permission of the
 
04:19:53.790 --> 04:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
instructor in the
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
classroom I have no problem with
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a problem with it
 
04:20:03.630 --> 04:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
either if the IEP or 504 plan hasn't
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
written in the 504 plan or the IEP that
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
this phone is necessary for this child
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
to obtain the objectives of this ie
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
good stuff do it we do it there are
 
04:20:18.910 --> 04:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions which should be made I don't
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
think this should be blank you don't use
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
your cell phone at all in the
 
04:20:25.990 --> 04:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
classroom um I think that's an
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
overreach um so uh I I would say that
 
04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
some states are doing that large broad
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
thing you check them in you put them in
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
a box you lock them up etc etc uh what
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
do you do in case that the parent calls
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
and wants to get a hold of them there's
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
what happened when you were kids in
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
school did you call the office was there
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
a permission note sent to school saying
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
hey I'm going to pick up Susan here at 4
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock or 3 o' not in the morning in
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and they won't be able to
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
participate in the activities after
 
04:21:02.349 --> 04:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
school today I need to pick them up they
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
got a dental appointment okay that's the
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
way you do it or they parent can call
 
04:21:10.910 --> 04:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
the office but when you're calling and
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
interrupting that student during class
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
you're interrupting 25 students you're
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
interrupting the teacher the teacher is
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
getting off task off Target and that's
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
what we don't want we have X number of
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
minutes in our calendar year we need to
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
utilize those minutes we don't need to
 
04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
extend the year we of course they're
 
04:21:33.870 --> 04:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
doing it down South Carolina where my
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
daughter is a teacher they're working in
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
the summertime now but they take time
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
off when we're probably working
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
today but I think what we need to do is
 
04:21:45.070 --> 04:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
we need to utilize time appropriately
 
04:21:48.269 --> 04:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
accommodations are good but we also have
 
04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
to remember what this is doing to our
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
students and it's the the the impacts of
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
mental and physical health that I'm also
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
really concerned about when you look at
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
the IEPs and you see that category out
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the 13 IEP categories other health
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
impaired why is that ballooning in this
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
state well I would say and I'm not I
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
can't prove it but my guess work is has
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
a lot to do with our social interactions
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
and the issues brought forth by our
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
technology and I'm not oppositional
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
technology I am all for it uh but I I
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a place and a time
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
for everything um so I will conclude
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
with this one last statement here in
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
2024 a national survey 70% of
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
participating Educators who teach in
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
schools that allow cell phones found it
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
very very disruptive 90% of surveyed
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
Educators support restricting student
 
04:22:49.389 --> 04:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
use of cell phones during instructional
 
04:22:49.399 --> 04:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
use of cell phones during instructional
time

04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
90% And I think you'll see parents in in
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
the same wavelength you know parents
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
really want the the child to receive
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
everything that school's designed to do
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and if we allow this disruptor to
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
disrupt that we're not going to succeed
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I thank you very much and
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be willing to take any questions
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for
 
04:23:19.359 --> 04:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for
representative

04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
lad yes represent Murray thank you Mr
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
um with regard to parent involvement are
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
you aware that there are already apps
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
and programs out there that um parents
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
and children can talk to each other and
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
um have a conversation about time
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
management use during the day set time
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
limits allow certain
 
04:23:45.309 --> 04:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh apps to be used during certain parts
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:23:49.630 --> 04:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
day yeah I am but I'll go back to some
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
of the research that I found when I
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
talked to Dr ranuli down at University
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
of Connecticut who was in charge of the
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
gifted talented program and Dr ranuli
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
said your mind's going to be on one
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
thing at a time you maybe have instance
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
like that where you can switch back and
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
forth if that phone is not to be used at
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
all then the mind is on learning that
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
history lesson which is going forward so
 
04:24:17.070 --> 04:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
with all the apps I know what we can do
 
04:24:18.510 --> 04:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
we can shut them off turn them on Buzz
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
them do all that um it's it's uh I think
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
we got to before we lose this thing
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
totally we need to really support our
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
teachers in the classroom and teachers
 
04:24:30.399 --> 04:24:31.710 align:start position:0%
teachers in the classroom and teachers
are

04:24:31.710 --> 04:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
asking let us control this give us give
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
us what we need instructional time is
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
not where this cell phone should be
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
unless we allow it and we talked about
 
04:24:44.429 --> 04:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
that before here with the social media
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
and all that and we've talked about how
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
that impacted those people in the Career
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
Technical education they need it you
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
know it's just like fixing that stove I
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning where the cf-2
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
comes on and where am I going to get the
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
information to fix it on my cell phone
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
and that may be the same way it's going
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
to be when we have some issues discussed
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the classroom especially when you're
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
talking about diesel mechanics um today
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's many mechanics
 
04:25:10.510 --> 04:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
that work without that cell phone but in
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
the classroom there's some content that
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
the teacher paid to deliver let the
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
teacher do it thank
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative lad for bringing this
 
04:25:26.349 --> 04:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
extremely important piece of legislation
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
forward um in your research have you
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
been able to find out any statistics on
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
numbers on how many um instances and um
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
sites of pornography that high school
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
students have been accessing
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have the the numbers or the
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
information on we've talked about that
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
where we've had cross District bullying
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
going on and uh yeah it it it's it's
 
04:25:55.229 --> 04:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
horrible what's going on and somehow we
 
04:25:58.710 --> 04:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
got to stop it and the only way I can do
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
is turn that switch off thank you
 
04:26:05.309 --> 04:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
further questions see none thank you
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.880 --> 04:26:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
Le

04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
Walco good morning Leo Walo from
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester I was a teacher at the high
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
school level in middle school for about
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
10 years I had a time in between two
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
times it wasn't 10 years continuous it
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
started um in Manchester and then I went
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
to London Dairy and then I did other
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
things and then I went back to teaching
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
again and I ended up back in
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester so uh I am in support of this
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think it even goes far
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
enough to tell you the truth I would
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
make it that there was no that's it you
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
put your phone in in the b in the little
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
bucket when you walk in the door you'll
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
pick it up on the way out but I'll take
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
it if this is what we can do so I want
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
to talk about three classrooms one is a
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
girl that taught next to me on this side
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
of me when I went to Manchester the
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
first time her name was Lauren and she
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
taught some of the highest science
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
classes for sophomores in the
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
district and when I came back 10 years
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
later she was still in the same
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
classroom still teaching the same
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
classes and I got to talk to her because
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
she was right next to me and she had had
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
to abandon entire units of
 
04:27:39.309 --> 04:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
biochemistry she didn't teach it anymore
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
because these kids that are destined for
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
nursing doctors veterinarians Engineers
 
04:27:50.349 --> 04:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
could no longer do it they could not
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
comprehend the material they could 10
 
04:27:56.590 --> 04:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
years earlier but they couldn't now and
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
she's a good teacher it took her years
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
to give up on it before she finally
 
04:28:05.109 --> 04:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
realized it can't be done so this isn't
 
04:28:08.670 --> 04:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
a problem for one cohort of kids that's
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
what happened to my nextd door neighbor
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
to the highest kids in Manchester
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
then I'll talk about my classroom my
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
classroom when I came back I would
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
taught like the middle middle area kids
 
04:28:21.870 --> 04:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
they're attract mine were all going to
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
college some of them thought they were
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
going much higher than they probably
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
could because of the level that they
 
04:28:29.710 --> 04:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
were in but they had aspirations some of
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
them quite
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
high and in February the last year I
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
taught at Memorial High School out of
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
desperation I took my own February
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
vacation and I called every single
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
parent of all of my students I started
 
04:28:47.790 --> 04:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
with the fs and I made my way up the
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
list Susie is a great kid love to have
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
her in class super fun personality
 
04:28:56.550 --> 04:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Susie's failing and uh you
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
know we can do something about it though
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
I notice she's on her phone a lot and I
 
04:29:04.030 --> 04:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
bought one of these shoe organizers the
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
clear ones that you can see through and
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hang it on my wall right
 
04:29:11.070 --> 04:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
near the door and if you want I'll put
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
your name on the list that Susie knows
 
04:29:16.590 --> 04:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
she has to deposit her phone when she
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
walks in my door and because she was
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
failing susy's mommy said yes and so I
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
went the fs and then the D's and then
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
the C's and by the time I got to the B's
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
I was able to say you know Jeff Jeff
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any problem but he too
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
would benefit from a more organized
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
classroom time and I got unanimity and I
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
became an urban legend I had kids that I
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
had never had kids that were taking
 
04:29:48.510 --> 04:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
senior science that were never my
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
student that came in they wanted to see
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
it it had become that big of a
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
story so I didn't know this bill existed
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
if I did in time if I had known in time
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
I would have gone and I would have dug
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
through my things but I kept the records
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
of what happened and we were going into
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
the lower end of the year like summer is
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
around the bend start to fall off but my
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
scores went up they went up across the
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
board I wish I had the actual figures
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
here for you but I can tell you that it
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
better they had a hard time adjusting it
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been as hard for them if
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a single classroom that this
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
was happening but they're addicted
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're chemically physically addicted
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
the phones were built to be addictive
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
they the people that created this
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
technology have said so themselves it
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
was built so that you can't leave it
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
alone so it isn't only time off task
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
that we could literally sit there and
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
measure with a with a little stopwatch
 
04:31:02.109 --> 04:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
it's that when a 14-year-old's mind
 
04:31:05.469 --> 04:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
whose attention is so fragile now so
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
fragile when it's broken because that
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
thing vibrates you there's no way to
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
measure how many minutes if at all they
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
ever are able to bring their attention
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
truly back to Bear of what we're talking
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
about it it it can be gone for good in
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
in a single me let me see text it back
 
04:31:32.109 --> 04:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
oh smiley face whatever it is it's gone
 
04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not measurable the loss in
 
04:31:35.000 --> 04:31:35.950 align:start position:0%
so it's not measurable the loss in
learning

04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
learning
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
time the last person I want to talk
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
about is the guy that was on the other
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
side of me he was there when I started
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
he was there when I returned and he was
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
teaching the lowest level freshman
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
science classes and because it became a
 
04:31:51.070 --> 04:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
thing of urban legend there was a lot of
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
talk in the science department about
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
this crazy thing that I had done he
 
04:31:59.109 --> 04:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
didn't want it done because and I don't
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
even blame him the behavior in the
 
04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
classroom is so bad that he said at
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
least they're quiet and the few kids
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
that he could hope to try to work on a
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
lesson with could be down front and the
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
others could be in the back zombified on
 
04:32:15.640 --> 04:32:16.349 align:start position:0%
others could be in the back zombified on
their

04:32:16.349 --> 04:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:32:16.359 --> 04:32:18.349 align:start position:0%
their
phone

04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
so here's the thing it's our fault it's
 
04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the adults fault that this is happening
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot expect an addicted
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
13-year-old child to be able to leave it
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
alone they can't and so we need to be
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
the adults in the room we need
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
to I I I don't believe we need to be
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
able to use a phone but fine you you
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
want to say that there are some lessons
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
that they all need to be on their phone
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to derail it for
 
04:32:52.439 --> 04:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to derail it for
that

04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
but if you don't pass something like
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
this nothing else you do here is going
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
to matter it isn't going to matter what
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
the curriculum is what the supports are
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
how long the day is what kind of uh
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
whatever because they're not there if
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
they're not there they can't be reached
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
I don't care what book you use what
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
method you teach so as a teacher because
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
you kind of always are it's got that SFI
 
04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
type of thing right once a teacher
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
always a teacher for the benefit of my
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues that are still in the
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
trenches and for the benefit of these
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
poor young people who have no ability
 
04:33:47.551 --> 04:33:47.561 align:start position:0%
to we can't even do it I've watched some
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
people in here sitting on their phone we
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
can't do it and we didn't come up with
 
04:33:55.789 --> 04:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
our brains interfacing with this
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
technology and we can't do it so I I
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to pass this bill or
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
make it even
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
stronger if you have any questions I'll
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
take thank you very much uh questions
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
possibly yes Cornell Thank you thank you
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
for taking my well it's a question
 
04:34:16.429 --> 04:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
statement do you know that Manchester
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
has passed a cell phone electronic
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
policy and they have to be put away at
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the day all day long be
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
taken out I don't know I think that's
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
awesome I I know that they
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
were I had a I had one of the school
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
board members can't is it is it new it's
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty recent yeah that's that's
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
yeah better late than never
 
04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh further questions
 
04:34:45.070 --> 04:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent Morris yeah I think I
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
already know the answer for this one but
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
may as well
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
ask if you could change anything in here
 
04:34:54.029 --> 04:34:54.039 align:start position:0%
to make it even more as you say
 
04:34:56.189 --> 04:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
restrictive what would it be the
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
bill I would um I would take out these
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions and I would just say that the
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
the phones are not to be um I don't
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
think they should be seen during the
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
school day I really don't
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
you know the the thing he discussed
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
about them walking down the hall and
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
talking to each other it isn't only in
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
those 3 minutes in between classes when
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
they pass which is really some of their
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
major socializing time it isn't only
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
then it's at lunch they just sit lost in
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
a dream they're not there they're not
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
able to like learn how to share a meal
 
04:35:40.990 --> 04:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
with people personally if I if I had it
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
my way I would have it you put your
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
phone away it not to be seen in the day
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
at all you pick it up at night when you
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
leave the building you know parents get
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
freaked out because we're addicted and
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
now we've gotten to these habits of we
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't like deal with what needs to be
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
dealt with before school in the morning
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to text oh do you
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
need a ride oh you know did you get this
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
picked up or whatever and there there
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
can be some you know out outcry that
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
people are so addicted to this way of
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
communicating that they they don't like
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
the idea of a change but I'm confident
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
that we'll be fine you know we raised
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
kids before without being able to text
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
them I caught that one though I caught
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
him and we called him Walter White after
 
04:36:32.109 --> 04:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
that further
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
questions cenan thank you very much for
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%

superintendent McGee and um Cameron one
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%

students so first off thank you very
 
04:37:07.869 --> 04:37:07.879 align:start position:0%
much for uh allowing us to be here my
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
name is Chip McGee I'm the
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools in the pelum
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
school district
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
um uh it's wonderful to have uh Cameron
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
Marvin here he's an eighth grader um I'm
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
just going to do a very brief
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
introduction and then he's going to do
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
most of the speaking um so the pal
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
Memorial School our Middle School um
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
enacted a program to have cell phones
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
not just off in a way but uh locked in a
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
way uh during the school day uh at the
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of this school year uh and so
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
there was some concern in the community
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
um but uh uh we went ahead with this
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
program and um I would tell you uh I
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
could have done a data presentation
 
04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's very good data about fewer
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
incidents in the bathrooms um uh
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
increased time on task uh a great
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
satisfaction from teachers um uh but uh
 
04:38:02.789 --> 04:38:02.799 align:start position:0%
when we were putting a presentation for
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the board together Cameron offered to
 
04:38:09.150 --> 04:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
speak um uh and uh when I saw this bill
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
come forward I was very excited um I'm
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
in support of it uh and uh I asked uh
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
Cameron whether he would dust off what
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
he said and uh prepare it for uh this
 
04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
group um and so I think his firsthand
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
experience is going to be um uh far more
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh interesting than anything an old
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
Cameron thank you to committee chair
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
cordelli and vice chair Noble for the
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to speak to you
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
today thank you to all the
 
04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
representatives of Ed education policy
 
04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
and administration my name is Cameron
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
Marvin I'm an eighth grader at pal
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
Memorial School this year we implemented
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
the use of Y pouches within our policy
 
04:38:58.830 --> 04:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
to restrict the use of personal cell
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
phones during the school day I wanted to
 
04:39:03.310 --> 04:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
share my experience as a student with
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
the new pouches so
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
far since I'm a teenager I definitely do
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
not like getting up for school every day
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
once I'm there I like school and I
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
really like our teachers one of the
 
04:39:16.029 --> 04:39:16.039 align:start position:0%
hardest adjustments I've had to make
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
while starting Middle School was dealing
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
with all the distractions within the
 
04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
classrooms these major distractions were
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
phone they were not only distracting
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
while doing it but they had to be spoken
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
to which interrupted the class sometimes
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
this would be multiple times a class and
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
it is frustrating when class has to stop
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
so much the teachers were trying to talk
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
but they would have to pause frequently
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
because they caught someone using their
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
phone it made it really hard to focus on
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
what they were saying or do enterpr work
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
many times kid kids would have
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
to kids would have their phones open and
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
check Snapchat show others videos
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
texting playing games or sometimes even
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
taking some photos or
 
04:40:10.110 --> 04:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
videos it was every single day when you
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
went into the restroom there would
 
04:40:13.868 --> 04:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
always be someone in there on the phone
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
or a group of people using them I would
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
see a lot of destructive behavior in the
 
04:40:20.190 --> 04:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
restrooms because some kids think it's
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
funny to record while doing something
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
wrong having the ability to record the
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
behavior and show it off to uh to show
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
it off would give kids more of the
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
temptation to do it since Yonder started
 
04:40:36.788 --> 04:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
this year classes have been much more
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
calm and I can definitely see it and
 
04:40:44.430 --> 04:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
with Yonder the temptation to use the
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
phone in class is not there because no
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
one has access to it the kids are not
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble in class as much and
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
the teachers can teach the whole class
 
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
without having to tell someone to put
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
their phones away or send them to the
 
04:41:01.868 --> 04:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
office the good thing is that you don't
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
see just one person standing out and
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
being punished with their phone taken
 
04:41:08.830 --> 04:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
away everyone is equal and everyone has
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing with their phone no
 
04:41:13.470 --> 04:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
one has that extra pressure the stress
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
of using a restroom break has gone away
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
I used to be afraid of what I would walk
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
into I would be afraid that if something
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
was damaged I would walk in on it and it
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
was happening or I would have have to be
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
questioned later because I signed out to
 
04:41:33.750 --> 04:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
use the
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
restroom since the kids cannot use their
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
phones they cannot record any behaviors
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
to show off to
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
others that has kept a lot of kids from
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
even attempting half of the things they
 
04:41:46.750 --> 04:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
they used to do when people ask me how
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's going with Yonder the main
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
description I can give is that it's more
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
peaceful there's a huge weight lifted
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
off our shoulders the phones are out of
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
sight and everyone knows it so in a way
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
it makes the day much
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
calmer I love that I can pay more
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
attention when the teacher is talking it
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
is very hard to focus when the teacher
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
is explaining a lesson or directions
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
while a few kids next year are sneaking
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
on the phone
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
I used to leave school stressed out on
 
04:42:17.470 --> 04:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
many days because I couldn't focus in
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
class school does not come easy to me
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I have to pay I have to pay
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
attention and work hard for all my
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
grades with all the Tik toks being made
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
videos or photos taken and all the kids
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
sneaking their phones it was stressful
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
when trying so hard to pay
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
attention I could tell that the teachers
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
did their best to keep the cell phones
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
away but let me tell you something
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
something a 13-year-old is really good
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
at hiding
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
it teachers can't see every single thing
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
while uh talking in front of the room
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how anyone could
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
ever teach if they had to be looking for
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
phones the whole
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
class in the beginning kids were very
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
vocal and annoyed about the
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
pouches but I think that is because we
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about it I'm on the
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
football team in palum as well as the
 
04:43:07.160 --> 04:43:08.550 align:start position:0%
football team in palum as well as the
baseball

04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
baseball
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
team and I am also in the Middle School
 
04:43:10.878 --> 04:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
team and I am also in the Middle School
band

04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
band
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
because of that I have a very diverse
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
group of friends classmates and
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
teammates many that I have heard
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
opinions from do not mind and say that
 
04:43:22.590 --> 04:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
they appreciate it
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
now the fact that that the pressure of
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
the temptation to use the phone even for
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
a quick second is gone makes things much
 
04:43:29.160 --> 04:43:30.628 align:start position:0%
a quick second is gone makes things much
more

04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
calm the office always allows us to call
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
a parent if we need to talk to them
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
about something important such as rid
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
homes rise home or if something is
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
canceled after school that is something
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
the kids and parents can feel good about
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
I know this is an official survey or
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
anything but when talking to my friends
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
and classmates they don't mind it
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
anymore I've seen firsthand the negative
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
effects of cell phone usage in
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
class since the start of this program
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
I've yet to see any negative effects of
 
04:44:00.990 --> 04:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
restricting the phone
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
use with this being said I feel that HB
 
04:44:06.750 --> 04:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
131 should pass and the school boards
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
within the state should adopt a policy
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
in order to govern student cell phone
 
04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
cell phone use in schools like we have
 
04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
done in pelum thank
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Cameron for your
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um it was uh very interesting
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
um I I had one question um what was the
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
reaction when you said about um use of
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
you me and then you sure uh so as the
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh there was um uh pretty
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
significant reaction um uh some uh about
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
equal measure thank goodness I really
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate as some of the the testimony
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
we've already heard um and uh then some
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh don't or uh very upset about um uh
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
encroachment on freedom or safety issues
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
or security issues and so we had to work
 
04:45:12.080 --> 04:45:13.350 align:start position:0%
or security issues and so we had to work
through

04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
those um and uh it was something that I
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
was grateful that the community and uh
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
my school board uh supported um
 
04:45:27.150 --> 04:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
so reactions when you first heard about
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
it um I
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
mean there
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
was a bunch of mostly kids that didn't
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
really like it cuz
 
04:45:45.070 --> 04:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's an addiction and um it
 
04:45:48.190 --> 04:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
is it is frustrating when you when kids
 
04:45:50.190 --> 04:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't have their phones for a certain
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
period of
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
time but um I started to to actually
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
like like it and um see the use of
 
04:46:01.360 --> 04:46:03.628 align:start position:0%
like like it and um see the use of
it

04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
um and how everybody else is reacting to
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
it too so I one other thing which is uh
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
we we still have uh frequent petitions
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
from students to try and get it
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
overturned um that the the tension is
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
still there it's not like it's happily
 
04:46:20.480 --> 04:46:21.550 align:start position:0%
still there it's not like it's happily
ever

04:46:21.550 --> 04:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
after thank you uh questions represent L
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
fields thank you chairman and thank you
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
both for being here today Cameron you
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
were wonderful you were articulate
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
concise convincing you should be a
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
spokesman for Yonder and you've got the
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
the hair too I I think
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm so happy that you brought this up
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I have to tell you that admittedly
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm addicted to because as
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
you were talking I have a bill cell
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
phone bill as well I wanted to grab my
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
phone and look it up during your test
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to just step back and say
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
no so I wanted to ask you about Yonder
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
because I have the Yonder paperwork too
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the bill that I'm bringing forward I
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your opinion please um it
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
was a grant grant money which I know is
 
04:47:10.590 --> 04:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
like taboo because it's budget season
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
right it was a $250,000 Statewide grant
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
for schools to apply because the Yonder
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
pouches are about $30 per head exactly
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
$30 right and I understand that um for
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator well for the teachers
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
it can be very uncomfortable to have to
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
police this throughout the day and just
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
like we heard the kids do have the dummy
 
04:47:31.230 --> 04:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
phones right with all the upgrades hand
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the dummy phone um so my question to you
 
04:47:35.708 --> 04:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
is what do you think about that because
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
I was thinking this would help gain
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
momentum with positive testimonials and
 
04:47:41.830 --> 04:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
it would gain contaction throughout the
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
state and I'm I'm sorry that it wasn't
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
available when you did this yeah so um
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh I would say speaking only from our
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
experience uh uh I'm not here in terms
 
04:47:57.868 --> 04:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
of speaking for other districts but uh
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
in at pel Memorial School it was a
 
04:48:02.910 --> 04:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
transformative impact and it's because
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
it is locked in a way and I would add in
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
the students possession so we're not
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
taking a $600 device away from them um
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
all day um uh but they can't access it
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's also very smooth to operate I
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
feel like a spokesman for the company
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
but it is one of the uh few uh tools
 
04:48:26.430 --> 04:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
that I found in in schools that had an
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
instant uh and high value
 
04:48:29.240 --> 04:48:31.070 align:start position:0%
instant uh and high value
impact

04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
follow just quickly too would you mind
 
04:48:36.030 --> 04:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
Shar my my understanding is limited but
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that you carry the
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
pouch and then there are magnets
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the School wherever the
 
04:48:43.310 --> 04:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
children are allowed to use Excuse me
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
students you're not a child um the exits
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
or wherever you do you just touch this
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
magnet with your pouch and and it opens
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
up or how does that work so the magnet
 
04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
um when it there's like a
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
little piece at the top that actually
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
connects it and when you use the
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
magnet um there's a mechanism inside
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
that releases it when you press onto
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
it I'm not one 100% sure how it works
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
you know those things that uh they put
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
on cloes so you don't shoplift and that
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
people can take off of uh the the clerk
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
can take off um I would also tell you
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
that now that students have been doing
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
it for uh this year it it literally
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
takes a student less than a second um to
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
get it unlocked um and you don't need
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
it yes represent Woodcock thank you once
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
again thank you as I'm sure I also say
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing for your presentation and
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
coming here it's terrific to see a
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
student speaking um just a a question
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
how Cameron how did you happen to know
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.040 --> 04:49:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
him you didn't find there any phone
 
04:50:02.430 --> 04:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
there okay all right thank you I was
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
just curious CU how student responded
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you he he called him on the phone
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
texted uh represent Murray thank you Mr
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
04:50:15.270 --> 04:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
and thanks for the question I just
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear um we're also talking
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
about um the instance when uh phones are
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
also medical devices does this that's a
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
really great question um so uh as uh
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad uh mentioned um any
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
accommodation whether it's for a special
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
education a medical accommodation uh
 
04:50:37.628 --> 04:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
disability 504 all of those are
 
04:50:40.230 --> 04:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
exceptions and there's a very clear proc
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
well we already have those processes and
 
04:50:44.110 --> 04:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
we we made it clear up front there will
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
be exceptions people use it for uh
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
diabetes for example tracking and those
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
those are exceptions and they have to
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
be U representative McDonald thank you
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you both for being
 
04:51:00.030 --> 04:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
here this was very helpful Cameron uh
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
but my question is probably better
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
directed at you the superintendent um
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
the policy seems to be working in pelum
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
would this bill require you to adopt a
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
new policy or you already comping with
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill would say uh we are
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
compliant and uh I will editorialize
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
that just from my personal point of view
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
um the the the proposed Bill simply
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't go as far as needed um uh the
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
exceptions as enforced by teachers uh is
 
04:51:31.868 --> 04:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
too much to ask of teachers okay thank
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hall oh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question so there are
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions for 504's IEP are there
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions for the Educators themselves
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
if it's a science class and they want
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
the kids to be doing data on their phone
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
no that's not acceptable no we so we we
 
04:51:51.868 --> 04:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
are fortunate that we students have
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
devices they have Chromebooks uh the the
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
radical difference I would say to the
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
committee is that a cell phone accesses
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
data through a cellular network that's
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
unfiltered uh a Chromebook Chromebook
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
accesses data through our Network that
 
04:52:08.110 --> 04:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
is filtered um and uh so uh I don't
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
really see any place where accessing
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
data through uh an unfiltered cell phone
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
is appropriate in the school setting
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Terry thank you
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
I can't see you but I know you're there
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
oh there you are
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
now uh thank you Cameron for your uh
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today I I
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
think it's so helpful uh to have
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
students come from time to time when
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
there are issues that impact them
 
04:52:36.310 --> 04:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
directly and this is not the first
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
instance where we've had students come
 
04:52:40.548 --> 04:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
and testify but I think it's so
 
04:52:43.230 --> 04:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
important that we hear directly from you
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
and others because you're the ones who
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
are being um uh affected adversely in a
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
very significant way I don't want to
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
forget the teachers in this instance but
 
04:52:55.548 --> 04:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
um but thank you very much we don't want
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
to to overlook or lose your voice
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering how long the policy has
 
04:53:07.548 --> 04:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
been in place at at pum sir
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
and what your observation would be
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
provided it's been more than a week or
 
04:53:16.830 --> 04:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
two what what's your observation with
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
respect to how this is impacting either
 
04:53:21.628 --> 04:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
positively or
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
negatively uh student academic
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
performance so uh in terms of timeline
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
we uh implemented this right at the
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of this school year um so
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
August 23rd I believe um uh and in terms
 
04:53:42.670 --> 04:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
of impact uh I don't know yet uh uh from
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
a uh State assessment point of view
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's in the spring um but that is one
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the intents of this is to improve
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
academic performance I do know that our
 
04:53:54.750 --> 04:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing which is called I
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
ready um uh has has shown some
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary indications of a positive
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
direction but I can't draw that
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion yet and I don't know if you
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
consistently outstanding so doesn't make
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
any differ representative
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
both for coming in front of us
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
especially you Mr mavin you did a
 
04:54:25.230 --> 04:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful job very very well very
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
applaud you for that um I have a
 
04:54:30.548 --> 04:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
question about behavior issues um in the
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
past and and currently what you're
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
seeing superintendent could you tell me
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
if you're seeing any Improvement in
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
behavior issues yeah so uh so the
 
04:54:40.948 --> 04:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
definitive answer is yes
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh so uh as measured by um Discipline
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
matters related to the bathroom um as
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
Cameron spoke about um but I'd go one
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
step further which is to say the uh the
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
principal uh wonderful principal at pel
 
04:54:58.110 --> 04:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
Memorial School name is Zach Medlock uh
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
he disagreed with me two years ago
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
pretty completely that uh that this was
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
an issue because if you walk to the
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
Halls two years ago you did not see a
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
cell phone problem um because
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
13-year-olds are good at hiding it um so
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
it happened out of out of view um and uh
 
04:55:20.670 --> 04:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
he he has changed 180 degrees um uh and
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
he'll admit it he kind of wanted uh uh
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
to just let the let the kids learn
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
through experience was his argument um
 
04:55:31.948 --> 04:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
uh and he said we did have a problem I
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
just couldn't see it um so Less in the
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
bathroom um uh but also I think the the
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
discussion of time on task is really
 
04:55:39.680 --> 04:55:40.788 align:start position:0%
discussion of time on task is really
significant

04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
many fewer interruptions wonderful
 
04:55:45.070 --> 04:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair yes thank you would
 
04:55:48.910 --> 04:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
you believe there was a time that when I
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
was in high school that you could smoke
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in the courtyard and we
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
rallied against that when they outlawed
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
it and guess what they were right yeah
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that I think the analogy
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
to cigarettes is um apt thank you so
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
much repr Woodcock thank you J cell for
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
allowing me do this superintendent just
 
04:56:13.868 --> 04:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
a question this is the middle school I'm
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the PM system yep I'm
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
assuming there's a high school there is
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
is there is your intention to move this
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
progress through the whole school system
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so um uh I uh had said from the
 
04:56:27.390 --> 04:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
moment we put it in place at Memorial
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
that I intended to put it in the high
 
04:56:31.948 --> 04:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
school um The High School uh Student
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
Government um very skillfully organized
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
themselves um to make the case that they
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
can police themselves um and so uh the
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
principal uh at the high school Don me
 
04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
and I have given them a a year reprieve
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
um but we will put it in place um uh if
 
04:56:54.030 --> 04:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
and when we see it to be necessary but
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
they did ask as high school students can
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
they uh can so we switched to off and
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
Away there this year it used to be you
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
could have it out now it's off and away
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
just like Manchester um and so we have
 
04:57:07.948 --> 04:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not planning next year to implement
 
04:57:10.548 --> 04:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
it but I will as soon as uh the
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
principal and I see it necessary thank
 
04:57:16.990 --> 04:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
you any further questions uh thank you
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
very much both of you for being here
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.548 --> 04:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.558 --> 04:57:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
Hoffman

04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hoffman
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
child kids at
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
lunch have the lunch
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
talks to
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:46.510 --> 04:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
yeah Gary Hoffman I live in Nash New
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I rise in support of this
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I am the President of the
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
nasua teachers union and uh I represent
 
04:57:58.830 --> 04:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,000 teachers uh in the
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
NASA School District as well as an
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
additional 400 uh School support staff
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I just want to first uh thank
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative lad for crafting this
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's a good good bill uh it
 
04:58:13.948 --> 04:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
gives school districts a little bit of
 
04:58:17.470 --> 04:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
leeway um it puts exemptions for 504s
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
and I AP so if a student has a re a
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
learning disability that requires cell
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
phone use or a medical exemption that
 
04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
would be like in a 504 often times this
 
04:58:31.708 --> 04:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
bill allows that um and so you know I I
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
think that this is really needed this
 
04:58:37.230 --> 04:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a controversial bill I mean
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
many countries have banned cell phones
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
we have France Brazil the Netherlands
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
Italy Portugal Finland even China have
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
restricted cell phone use in schools for
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
students the United Nations last year
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
put out a report warning about the
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
dangers of uh cell phone use by students
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
and schools so I think it's time that
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pass something similar my
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
school district the teachers have asked
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
for a bill like this um and in fact this
 
04:59:09.628 --> 04:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
year our high schools organized
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and um they uh they just
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
conducted a survey that we're going to
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
be sharing with our superintendent
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent to get teacher
 
04:59:20.910 --> 04:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
attitudes at the high school level
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
regarding cell phone use and
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
204 uh sorry 210 High School uh teachers
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
did take this uh cell phone survey and I
 
04:59:32.548 --> 04:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
would just like to share some of the
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
results of the survey now this survey
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
was created by an AP psychology teacher
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Paul Menard as well as a longtime vure
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
an English teacher and member of my
 
04:59:46.030 --> 04:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
executive board uh Walter Freeman and
 
04:59:48.868 --> 04:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Freeman
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh our teacher Walter Freeman actually
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
said something similar that you just did
 
04:59:55.470 --> 04:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
about cigarette
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
smoking but uh you know he he actually
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
said I think that in 20 years we're
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to look at giving unfettered cell
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
phone access to students um really in
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
the same way that 40 years ago we had
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
smoking stations and schools I mean 4
 
05:00:10.600 --> 05:00:13.110 align:start position:0%
smoking stations and schools I mean 4
years

05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.390 --> 05:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
now but I think that was about the time
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
was the early 80s where they started to
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
go away was 1979 really okay I was close
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
from high school all
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
right well I think I I think your
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
analogy really worked well though um
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
they are addictive but uh when the when
 
05:00:35.548 --> 05:00:35.558 align:start position:0%
the survey results came through the the
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
210 High School teachers responded this
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
way uh 89 9.6% of them agreed that cell
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
phone access lowered student
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
concentration with
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
64.8% strongly agreeing
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
86.7% of the respondents agreed that
 
05:00:55.948 --> 05:00:55.958 align:start position:0%
cell phones hindered students ability to
 
05:00:58.390 --> 05:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
complete lengthy assignments and
 
05:01:00.270 --> 05:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
58.6% strongly
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
agreed um
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
82.8% of the respondents agreed that
 
05:01:07.230 --> 05:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
cell phones red reduce peer engagement
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
with 53% strongly agreeing
 
05:01:10.480 --> 05:01:11.788 align:start position:0%
with 53% strongly agreeing
and

05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
89.5% agreed that cell phones interfered
 
05:01:18.070 --> 05:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
with self-directed learning and 60%
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
strongly agreed with that statement now
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the Nashua School District the
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
current uh the current policy if we we
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't really have anything formal is
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
basically it's teacher discretion but we
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
surveyed that amongst High School
 
05:01:36.510 --> 05:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and 69% of the respondents
 
05:01:38.590 --> 05:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
reported dissatisfaction with their
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
ability to for uh phone related
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
expectations in their own classrooms so
 
05:01:45.708 --> 05:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
it sort of Echoes what some of the
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
previous uh speakers said you know
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
teachers would like to enforce this uh
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
cell you know enforce cell phone use in
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
their classrooms but increasingly
 
05:01:58.030 --> 05:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
they've had a really tough time because
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
they are so
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
addictive um so I just I don't want to
 
05:02:03.708 --> 05:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
take a lot of your time but I did want
 
05:02:06.750 --> 05:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
to lend my voice as a person that did
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
teach for 22 years in the Nashwood
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
school district and currently on leave
 
05:02:12.510 --> 05:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
as a representative of the Nashua
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
teachers union I'm letting you know that
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
the Thousand or so teachers in the
 
05:02:18.548 --> 05:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
Nashua School District would appreciate
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
this and we really thank the authors of
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%

questions representative dry thank you
 
05:02:27.788 --> 05:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
question um in the middle of this bill
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
it says districts are encouraged to
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
consider exceptions to student use
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
during instruction so it doesn't close
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
the door to prohibiting it is that still
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
not good enough in your mind or is that
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay my personal uh Viewpoint as a
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
teacher was is it doesn't go far enough
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
however I'm smart enough to know that
 
05:02:55.390 --> 05:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably more likely that this
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
would pass with that exception um there
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
might be some very strong feelings about
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
having stronger language um I I think
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
for a first step this is this is a good
 
05:03:11.390 --> 05:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Freeman
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us so what I heard
 
05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
you say is that there are a lot of
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
teachers in Nashville are having an
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
issue with this and it's not a new issue
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
it's something that's been ongoing and
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
the one question I I I'm going to ask
 
05:03:32.190 --> 05:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
you is um have you gone in front of your
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
school board and express these concerns
 
05:03:34.878 --> 05:03:36.510 align:start position:0%
school board and express these concerns
to

05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:40.670 --> 05:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
them so we follow chain of command and
 
05:03:43.708 --> 05:03:43.718 align:start position:0%
our teachers right now are have formed a
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee with our assistant
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent with the blessing of our
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent to research this issue
 
05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
and we are hoping that these survey
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
results will um get our our our central
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
office administration on board I think
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to get there and we were
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
planning to craft a policy together to
 
05:04:07.150 --> 05:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
take to the school board because we know
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh any policy we bring forward is going
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
to happen have a lot more weight if we
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
do it with uh the superintendent
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent of
 
05:04:19.510 --> 05:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
schools yes repr Sal thank you so much
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so I the two-part question I guess
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
the the first part
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
is I mean I'm in a district that already
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
has a cell phone policy as a district um
 
05:04:32.350 --> 05:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
which we've had our own hiccups with but
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
do you think that we need a state
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
mandate for this or do you think that
 
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
local control around making these
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
policies is sufficient
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
the state policy will help teachers all
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire enforce this if
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
we can tell our students oh this is just
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
state law that will help us so much it
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
really will honestly and we would love
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
your backing on this ask a follow follow
 
05:05:01.150 --> 05:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I know like I'm from a district
 
05:05:02.310 --> 05:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's fortunate enough where students
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
are issued Chromebooks or other devices
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
use we have that in n as well is that
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
something that's Universal across New
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or do we have districts that
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
can't afford to provide those to their
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
students where if they need to access
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
research that they might not be able to
 
05:05:22.590 --> 05:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
get to within the classroom that having
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
that access would make it more
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
available well I can only speak
 
05:05:30.030 --> 05:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to nashua's uh 10,000
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
students we have one toone access at the
 
05:05:35.190 --> 05:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
secondary level the middle and high
 
05:05:36.990 --> 05:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
school levels and I believe we're
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
getting to that level at the elementary
 
05:05:42.430 --> 05:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
um but the beauty of this bill is if you
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
have a community that is in that
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
situation and there may be some um it
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
does offer uh for instructional use only
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
on teacher discretion they might be able
 
05:05:56.590 --> 05:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
to craft a policy to kind of get where
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're getting at um but you know that's
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
a really I don't know to rely on
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
personal student devices you know that's
 
05:06:06.750 --> 05:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
an incredibly unfair thing because you
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
know certain kids are going to have
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
iPhone 17s others you know might not
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
barely have anything um so I I I hope
 
05:06:15.788 --> 05:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
that the state wouldn't that that
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something we would hope to
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
rely and I hope that we would uh strive
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
to get one toone Computing eventually
 
05:06:25.150 --> 05:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
further questions see none thank you
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hawkins uh
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
going for the hatrick today Mr chairman
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
um so um thank you uh for your time for
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
the record Brian Hawkins representing
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire um we are in support
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
of a state law that would require uh
 
05:06:57.310 --> 05:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
this type of minimum standard for school
 
05:07:00.190 --> 05:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
districts to adopt a policy restricting
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh Pro uh or prohibiting cell phone use
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
in our schools and I some of the
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
previous speakers I think captured
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
really well um you know the reasons for
 
05:07:14.310 --> 05:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
that and so I won't repeat those um uh
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
Nea uh nationally recently conducted a
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
nationwide survey of its members and
 
05:07:21.868 --> 05:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
found that 90 90% of NAA members
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
supported a school policy prohibiting
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
cell phone uh personal devices during an
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
instructional time and 83% supporting uh
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting during the entire school day
 
05:07:37.230 --> 05:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
um and some of the takeaways included
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
that cell phone banss in schools were
 
05:07:41.110 --> 05:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
proliferating in the face of mounting
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that devices are taking a
 
05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
serious toll on students ability to
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
focus in the classroom uh and their
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
overall mental health um there are a lot
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
of District policies out there but many
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
of them can be vague and inconsistent
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
and in some cases difficult to enforce
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of local educator unions
 
05:08:04.590 --> 05:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to advocate for um tougher
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
and more uh uniform approaches that will
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
allow them to spend more time teaching
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
their classrooms and less time being
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
cell phone police um in anticipation of
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
this issue being a significant topic the
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
session uh any New Hampshire did survey
 
05:08:22.470 --> 05:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
over the winter break uh some of our
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
local leaders uh specifically asking
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
about whether their District had a
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
policy and sort of some follow-up
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions depending on you know whether
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
they did or didn't um and just to
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
summarize that
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the the noticeable Trend with
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
those responses was um that the um first
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
that it did make a positive difference
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
in their school um for those of who did
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
but especially those who had a
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
restriction that lasted throughout the
 
05:08:57.788 --> 05:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
school day and not just uh during
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
instructional time and a representative
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
lad did a good job I think describing
 
05:09:04.590 --> 05:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you know it's not just absolutely
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the instructional time but Al also that
 
05:09:10.110 --> 05:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
the socialization time
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
um hallways lunchroom Etc so um
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to the bill I'll go
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to the bill um
 
05:09:23.430 --> 05:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh we would just want to comment on some
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
of the language that's been brought up
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh specifically about uh such policy
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
shall restrict the use of student
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone use during class
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
instruction without educator approval
 
05:09:37.948 --> 05:09:37.958 align:start position:0%
Our concern here um would be that this
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
sort of uh puts too much into um the
 
05:09:46.030 --> 05:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
individual uh educator or teachers hands
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
to be uh the cell phone police and so
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I think if you did go
 
05:09:54.990 --> 05:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
broader I would say that lasting
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the school day would be one
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
way to um uh to address this um if um
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities when
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
students uh can use cell phones in a
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
class are needed this should probably
 
05:10:12.190 --> 05:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
probably be uh based on the school
 
05:10:14.708 --> 05:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
policy and at the administrative level
 
05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
and not at the classroom level um and it
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
should be consistent throughout the
 
05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
school um another thing we found too was
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
within a school district you may have
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
one school say the middle school that
 
05:10:30.070 --> 05:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
has a complete you know ban on cell
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
phone use but maybe not the high school
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from some of our locals
 
05:10:35.788 --> 05:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
where they said at the high school they
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
want the Middle School's um policy and
 
05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
so we've heard that too um and then the
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
second piece I wanted to raise about the
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill was the exceptions um and I do
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
think that um with respect to so so that
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
goes to the sentence about on line five
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
about districts being encouraged to
 
05:10:57.120 --> 05:10:58.150 align:start position:0%
about districts being encouraged to
consider

05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions um rather than that sentence
 
05:11:05.470 --> 05:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think it um the the the the last
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
sentence um I think those exceptions are
 
05:11:12.270 --> 05:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
important um I would add to those uh
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
multilanguage uh multilingual Learners
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
as as one of those exceptions because I
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
do know that they're in addition to the
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendent earlier brought up
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
medical needs as well so um but the
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
principles I'll just leave with you with
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I think are important from some of
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
the surveying that we've done is that is
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
is Bell to Bell is is important uh it
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
does make and I think it does make it
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
easier to
 
05:11:40.240 --> 05:11:42.190 align:start position:0%
easier to
enforce

05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
05:11:45.470 --> 05:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
um of the people who I may be repeating
 
05:11:48.270 --> 05:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
myself but of the people who did have
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
policies restricting them during
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
instructional times the occasional time
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
where we would see someone say it did
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
not make as much of a
 
05:11:57.788 --> 05:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
difference uh having having a
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition was when it was
 
05:12:00.910 --> 05:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
instructional time only and not
 
05:12:03.390 --> 05:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the school day so um but
 
05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
overall it was a it was a positive
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
impact um and so um
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
I'll the the other thing I would leave
 
05:12:14.708 --> 05:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
you with is
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the reactions from
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
Individual reactions that we got from
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
our uh members who do have these
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
policies uh were really encouraging and
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of them that stood out to me
 
05:12:30.110 --> 05:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
was about the school building being just
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
more calm uh less tense um the issues
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
about cyber bullying you know doesn't
 
05:12:40.230 --> 05:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
cure them all but uh
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
the superintendent from pelum earlier I
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
think brought up some of these examples
 
05:12:46.750 --> 05:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in other schools uh and
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
I think um so I I would Echo all of
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
those and uh but again we support this
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
type of a bill and happy to work with
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to make sure it's
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
something that um is good for all
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman cordelli uh
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bar Christina
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
school boards Association uh we didn't
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
specifically take a position on the on
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
the bill but we we certainly um support
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh efforts to uh restrict cell phone
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
bans uh in schools uh just a little bit
 
05:13:32.350 --> 05:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
of brief history um uh nhba does have a
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
sample policy on on on electronic
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
communication devices um I are my notes
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
say that we revised in 2006 I don't have
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
any specific recollection of that but I
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
do remember I um uh in 2010 uh we
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
revised to basically prohibit electronic
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
communication devices and we called
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
electronic communication devices because
 
05:13:55.110 --> 05:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
before cell phones we had kids that had
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
pagers and beepers some of you remember
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
may may remember those um uh and so we
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
our our sample policy initially did
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
Implement a ban basically Bell to Bell
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
if you will um the administrators liked
 
05:14:11.310 --> 05:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
it was some push back from parents
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
obviously for some of the reasons that
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
that that have have been discussed
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security and it's my device
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
and you can't take it things of that
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
nature um we have not revised the sample
 
05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
policy primarily because I think
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
districts um have been able to navigate
 
05:14:27.310 --> 05:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
that on themselves we heard from from
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
pum representative Cornell uh mentioned
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
that Manchester has a pretty robust
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
policy that that I've looked at um so
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know and I also had initial concerns
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
about you know is it one more thing for
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
for school boards to do but certainly
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
here in the testimony today I think it's
 
05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
undeniable that um that some sort of
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
restriction or or ban on cellones
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
limiting student use during the school
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
day is going to be um beneficial um for
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
staff students and and and primarily for
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the students um representative
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
litfield I did see your bill as well too
 
05:15:01.470 --> 05:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
we like that yours has the appropriation
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lads does not um uh so uh
 
05:15:07.548 --> 05:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
you know these these are not inexpensive
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know some districts can afford
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
Yonder pouch as other districts we know
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a fiscal challenge for
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
them um but uh anyway um you know we
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
certainly work with the committee if
 
05:15:19.868 --> 05:15:19.878 align:start position:0%
there are any amendments if you want um
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know I the one thing that I think is
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
beneficial for this is that I I forget
 
05:15:25.390 --> 05:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
who it was that mentioned is now School
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
boards can point to the law and say
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
parents we have an obligation an
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to do this and and we'll sort
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
of craft that craft a policy um in line
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
with whatever whatever language comes
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
out of this bill or representative
 
05:15:40.750 --> 05:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
litfield Bill one last point that I do
 
05:15:42.670 --> 05:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
want to mention representative Terry you
 
05:15:45.470 --> 05:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
asked um superintendent McGee if uh
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
palum had seen any academic Improvement
 
05:15:48.788 --> 05:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
yet and he said it was a little bit too
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
soon to to identify that I was at a
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
conference in Providence Rhode Island
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
back in September and there was a uh a
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
presentation from a principal at a
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
middle school in Providence and they had
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
just wrapped up two years of cell phone
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
bans he said and they again middle
 
05:16:06.670 --> 05:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
school so ages what 11 to 14 or so he
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
said in the two years that they had
 
05:16:10.190 --> 05:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
implemented this this ban they were
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
using the Yonder pouches um they saw
 
05:16:16.510 --> 05:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
instances of bullying go down because
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
instances of bullying went down there
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
were fewer fist fights in the cafeteria
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
in the locker room because there was
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
less bullying and fewer fist fights
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
student attendance went up because
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
student attendance went up there was
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
more time on task because there was more
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
time on task there was an academic um uh
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
an undeniable academic improvement with
 
05:16:38.190 --> 05:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
Stu with student performance so um we
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
think that you know we think that
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
limiting the use of these cell phones
 
05:16:45.390 --> 05:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
within the school district can alleviate
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of what I'll just call social ills
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
or societal ills while simultaneously
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
increasing student outcomes and student
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
performance so um we're happy to work
 
05:16:55.868 --> 05:16:55.878 align:start position:0%
with the legislature um if you want to
 
05:16:57.628 --> 05:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
see some sample policies I can I can
 
05:17:00.510 --> 05:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
pass those those on to Jen but um uh
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you thank you
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
very much questions from the committee
 
05:17:07.150 --> 05:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bon thank you Mr
 
05:17:08.350 --> 05:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:17:09.868 --> 05:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
question I'm just wondering if you have
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
a sense of how many school districts do
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
have policies in place at this time yeah
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we don't track that
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative we send it out you know
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
our sample policies out but we don't
 
05:17:23.070 --> 05:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
track which districts um uh adopt which
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
policies that also is I I believe it's
 
05:17:28.510 --> 05:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
an optional policy um I forget if we
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
categorize it optional or recommended so
 
05:17:32.708 --> 05:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
an optional policy it's impossible to
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
know yeah further questions
 
05:17:38.190 --> 05:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
representative Terry yes uh thank you
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for mentioning um what
 
05:17:43.470 --> 05:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
you learned at the conference in Rhode
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
Island um I I lived in Rhode Island for
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
over 30 years and um witnessed as a
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
apparent a real deterioration in um
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
academic performance student behavior
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh in the Providence metro
 
05:18:02.830 --> 05:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
area particularly and so I was very
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
heartened to hear you provide that
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
additional information thank you I'm
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
glad I could do that sir
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative litfield thank you
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
certainly um so you may not be the best
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
person to ask but I know at least you
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
know many of the PO sample policies that
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have out there and looking at the
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions regarding um I don't know
 
05:18:29.868 --> 05:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
let's say it's necessary for an IP or a
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
504 often times is it already in school
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
policy that the child would be assigned
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
um like a district device or something
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
if they needed it for IEP yeah that's a
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
good question representative thank you
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:18:45.628 --> 05:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
um you know without wasting the
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee's more time I don't know that
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
Becky would answer the special ed aspect
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
to that I know our sample policy I I
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
mean I can tell you anecdotally I think
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
some school districts do provide a
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
device to a child I don't know if it's
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily a cell phone or maybe a
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
tablet of some sort but yeah I think
 
05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
that can I I just anecdotally I think
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's certainly been wrapped into IEPs
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
and the district maybe paying for some
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
of those for for some for some some
 
05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you Mr Taran thanks for
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the in the event
 
05:19:22.430 --> 05:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
of um assisted technology for learning
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's one conversation but in
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
the event of like a another device um
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would be collecting medical data to
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
monitor a health condition that's often
 
05:19:35.230 --> 05:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
housed on a personal medical device uh
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
within a phone is that correct thank you
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
for the question I have no idea
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
that that's outside of my scope of
 
05:19:45.868 --> 05:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge yes represent Cel thank you
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
so first I I know for example my kids I
 
05:19:52.990 --> 05:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
AP has are allowed to take out her
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
device for music during tests so that
 
05:19:58.270 --> 05:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
she can focus on the test and how one
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of ADHD works but are there
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
districts that you're aware of where if
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
they brought in these policies they
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
would need financial support to be able
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
to have some kind of device for storing
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
phones or or some some type of like that
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to that don't
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily already have money in their
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
budget for these kinds of things that
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
would need State support to be able to
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
make that happen sure thank thank thank
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
so as the bill is written no it does not
 
05:20:26.430 --> 05:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
require districts to purchase any
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
technology or equipment to implement a
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
cell phone ban I'm just going to call it
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
a cell phone ban and we not get into the
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
between class and lunch and and all that
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
um that would be primarily a local
 
05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
decision with how a district wanted to
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
one craft their policy and to what um
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
what measures or steps a district would
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
want to take to ensure compliance and
 
05:20:50.948 --> 05:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement with the policy now just
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony and what little I
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
know of the conference I was at yes the
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
the Yonder bag is probably the best way
 
05:21:01.150 --> 05:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure compliance with the policy for
 
05:21:04.510 --> 05:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
districts that don't have the money to
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
purchase a called a device or equipment
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
similar the Yonder or the bag there's
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to be have to be education
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
training and parental buyin and I should
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
also say too just this this just jumped
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
on on my on jumped in my head in reading
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
a sample policy from somewhere um and I
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to derail this I really don't
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
but are we going to include smart
 
05:21:28.180 --> 05:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
watches with cell
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
watches with cell
[Music]

05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
phones per should have kept his mouth
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
shut I'm just saying represent Freeman
 
05:21:41.350 --> 05:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and and correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm pretty sure I distinctly heard
 
05:21:49.548 --> 05:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
somebody say that there is a grant that
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
is available for about
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
$250,000 that so you did hear that as
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
well if I may representative correct me
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong representative
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative litfield has a similar
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I forget the S somewhere in the
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
700s I forget the bill number
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative I think it just came out
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday maybe sure but you're not
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
touching your device
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
fantastic um I I I was looking at it
 
05:22:14.510 --> 05:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
earlier representative Lichfield has a
 
05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
similar bill and I believe the language
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same except for the fact
 
05:22:20.990 --> 05:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Lichfield seeks to
 
05:22:21.000 --> 05:22:21.990 align:start position:0%
that representative Lichfield seeks to
appropriate

05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:22:24.190 --> 05:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
$250,000 on some sort of competitive
 
05:22:26.430 --> 05:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
Grant if if if you will that districts
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
can apply for to get some money to
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of these pouches don't
 
05:22:33.788 --> 05:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
let my my smartphone comment um derail
 
05:22:37.390 --> 05:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
this um I you have my word that you know
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
policy Statewide if a local District
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
wants to include smartphones on that
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
they can without having to to to Tinker
 
05:22:46.830 --> 05:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
with with the proposed bill or there are
 
05:22:46.840 --> 05:22:48.110 align:start position:0%
with with the proposed bill or there are
any

05:22:48.110 --> 05:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much uh see
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
no further questions we thank you and uh
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.990 --> 05:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh I do come here in support of HB
 
05:23:21.788 --> 05:23:21.798 align:start position:0%
131 uh years ago we were told by
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
education reformers that students didn't
 
05:23:25.470 --> 05:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
need to know their math facts and
 
05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
calculators were the new technology that
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
would replace the need for students to
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
memorize math facts that did
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
happen um that fad harmed math education
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
in this country like many fads that
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes filter through the public
 
05:23:41.548 --> 05:23:41.558 align:start position:0%
schools today there are more feds than
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
filtering through the public schools too
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
to profit technology the industry not to
 
05:23:46.798 --> 05:23:48.110 align:start position:0%
to profit technology the industry not to
help

05:23:48.110 --> 05:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
students we all know that cell phones in
 
05:23:53.230 --> 05:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
class are distractions for students we
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
know that they certainly do not help
 
05:23:55.120 --> 05:23:56.230 align:start position:0%
know that they certainly do not help
students

05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
learn there may be exceptions for
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
students who have special needs but for
 
05:24:01.868 --> 05:24:01.878 align:start position:0%
the average student in school they've
 
05:24:03.910 --> 05:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
become distractions and I do I do
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there are exceptions in
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
here medical reasons um 504 or things
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
like that I think it needs to be
 
05:24:13.470 --> 05:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
flexible we don't want a one size fits
 
05:24:16.350 --> 05:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
all uh but I feel the same is true for
 
05:24:18.270 --> 05:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
the one toone devices that students now
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
use in school and at home to complete
 
05:24:20.040 --> 05:24:20.830 align:start position:0%
use in school and at home to complete
their

05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:24:23.150 --> 05:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
homework I believe it's a matter of time
 
05:24:24.590 --> 05:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
before we finally acknowledge the
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
mistake of replacing books and textbooks
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
with Chromebooks and iPads it was a
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
money maker again for the technology
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
industry but not always good for
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and students and I'm happy to
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
elaborate on this serious negative
 
05:24:40.270 --> 05:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
impact at the end if if you would if you
 
05:24:42.510 --> 05:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
would like um so I do think that
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
removing phones is a good step cell
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
phones do not have to be removed
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
entirely but during class time it should
 
05:24:49.840 --> 05:24:50.948 align:start position:0%
entirely but during class time it should
definitely

05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
be some have said that banning cell
 
05:24:55.708 --> 05:24:55.718 align:start position:0%
phones in class will be hard to enforce
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
but I heard a great solution to that one
 
05:25:00.670 --> 05:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
teacher reported that in her school if a
 
05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
cell phone is taken away from the
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
student because they are breaking the
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
rules the parent must pick it up that
 
05:25:10.030 --> 05:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much ends that that right away if
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
you have to have the parent coming in
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
every day to pick up the cell phone that
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
the kid's using a lot of times that
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
resolves itself Sweden is going in the
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
direction of eliminating technology in
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
school they say that it has created
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
students who do not know basic skills
 
05:25:27.830 --> 05:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's clear scientific evidence that
 
05:25:31.390 --> 05:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
digital tools impair rather than enhance
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
student learning Sweden's Carol kolinska
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
Institute a highly respected Medical
 
05:25:39.070 --> 05:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
School focused on Research search said
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
in a statement in August on the
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
country's National digitalization
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
strategy and education the push for
 
05:25:47.390 --> 05:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
technology in the classroom began with
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
Essa when it was signed into
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
law um I have no doubt that the
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
technology industry made sure that that
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
provision was in the federal law it's a
 
05:25:59.628 --> 05:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
profit maker it's a data Miner when it
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
come at high school where I live
 
05:26:03.868 --> 05:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
students unplugged from their digital
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
devices for a day to raise awareness
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
about how technology impacts their life
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh I was really pleased to to know that
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
our superintendent had had supported
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
this and I'll read to you some of their
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
findings on the se21 website if you
 
05:26:22.030 --> 05:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
would like to go look at them yourself
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to condense them I'm not going
 
05:26:26.830 --> 05:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
to read the entire thing we do not have
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
to live without technology and that's
 
05:26:30.750 --> 05:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not what I'm suggesting as it
 
05:26:32.830 --> 05:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
can enhance our lives but after many
 
05:26:35.230 --> 05:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
years of experimenting on CH children
 
05:26:36.868 --> 05:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
there are a great deal of negative
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
complications implications that come
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
from screen
 
05:26:45.310 --> 05:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
time so uh if you go to the sau21
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
website I'm just going to read the
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted Parts you can read the
 
05:26:50.470 --> 05:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
entire thing on on the website do do you
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
have that in written maybe you just
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
submit that okay will answer some of the
 
05:26:59.230 --> 05:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
questions that you had impact okay yeah
 
05:27:00.910 --> 05:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
let me just do this real quick teachers
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
were teachers were encouraged to
 
05:27:04.430 --> 05:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
integrate phone and laptop free
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
activities in class throughout the day
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
the library had board game and puzzles
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
and students played trivia at lunch it
 
05:27:13.150 --> 05:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
was very heartwarming and eye opening
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
experience um this is from some of the
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
people I also enjoyed seeing everyone's
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
face in the hallway and had much fun
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
during lunch playing trivia and really
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
connecting with my friends and teachers
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I'll turn this in I'll I'll
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
just I'll leave it at that um one oh one
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
complaint I did well I don't know if
 
05:27:35.470 --> 05:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's a complaint from a pum parent was
 
05:27:38.190 --> 05:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
the cost the cost to the school dish
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
District so I think if your legislation
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
were to cover that for these schools I
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have got that phone
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
call um so I think that that's one of
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns among parents is the cost
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
to the school district so maybe if that
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
goes hand inand that would alleviate
 
05:27:55.000 --> 05:27:57.070 align:start position:0%
goes hand inand that would alleviate
that

05:27:57.070 --> 05:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:00.430 --> 05:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
concern that's it thank you very much
 
05:28:03.390 --> 05:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
welcome uh questions for Miss
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
Banfield yes repres
 
05:28:08.910 --> 05:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
Mrs Banfield for coming in front of us
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
how do you think technology has impacted
 
05:28:12.840 --> 05:28:14.230 align:start position:0%
how do you think technology has impacted
the

05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
classroom oh okay so yeah so I did bring
 
05:28:20.030 --> 05:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
that up um well I think first of all
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm not against technology but you
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
know from day one uh when you know I got
 
05:28:29.470 --> 05:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
phone calls from parents uh that were
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
looking at their kids' iPad and finding
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
naked pictures of other students okay so
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's a problem um you know because
 
05:28:40.990 --> 05:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
first of all boys can be
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
charged with uh possessing pornography
 
05:28:46.350 --> 05:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
if they have a you know if they're
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
sharing that
 
05:28:51.310 --> 05:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
information um I had a nurse tell me one
 
05:28:57.390 --> 05:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
time that she was that when a
 
05:29:00.190 --> 05:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
child adolescent tries to commit suicide
 
05:29:03.070 --> 05:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
goes into the a is in the hospital the
 
05:29:05.670 --> 05:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
nurses have to sit there with that
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
student and do the if if they're you
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
know cuz sometimes they can be in the
 
05:29:11.670 --> 05:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
hospital for a week before they actually
 
05:29:15.070 --> 05:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
get admitted into the mental health um
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
institution so they have to sit there if
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're on their iPads and they have to
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
sit there and watch these kids because
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
what happens some of them are are like a
 
05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
a cell phone so they're getting messages
 
05:29:29.788 --> 05:29:29.798 align:start position:0%
and so there some of the messages is
 
05:29:29.798 --> 05:29:30.868 align:start position:0%
and so there some of the messages is
kill

05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
kill
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
yourself that's what she told me and
 
05:29:34.750 --> 05:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
some of the messages that the kids are
 
05:29:36.670 --> 05:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:29:39.390 --> 05:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
hospital for trying to commit suicide
 
05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
this is the messages that they're
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
getting on their iPads or Chromebooks
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
they have to take them because they have
 
05:29:48.990 --> 05:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
homework to do um a husband of a teacher
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
told me one time he has to sit with his
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
daughter to do homework because all she
 
05:29:55.590 --> 05:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
wants to do is is do YouTube videos
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
right so he was forced to sit there with
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
her and do homework maybe we can
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
restrict restrict it to the to the bill
 
05:30:04.910 --> 05:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
itself okay all right it's there's only
 
05:30:06.430 --> 05:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
a couple more the screen time from
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
optometrist just talk to them mental
 
05:30:08.718 --> 05:30:09.910 align:start position:0%
optometrist just talk to them mental
health

05:30:09.910 --> 05:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:30:13.788 --> 05:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah so there's problems great thank
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome any further
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you uh The

05:30:45.788 --> 05:30:45.798 align:start position:0%
because uh I I was at a County
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
government meeting and I saw the um uh
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
the bills about uh one superintendent
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
for instance uh Per County and I thought
 
05:30:59.070 --> 05:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
my county and ton I went off um and so
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh I saw this bill uh and decided that I
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
would like to just add a little bit
 
05:31:08.590 --> 05:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a different perspective
 
05:31:08.600 --> 05:31:10.030 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a different perspective
um

05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
so just add I I think I think the
 
05:31:14.868 --> 05:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
testimony has been so incredibly
 
05:31:17.310 --> 05:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
informative for me but I'm a lifelong
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
educator uh college
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
professor uh and I was asked uh by my
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
son's High School teacher uh last year
 
05:31:31.708 --> 05:31:31.718 align:start position:0%
to come in and guest teach uh a course
 
05:31:33.430 --> 05:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
it did I say English high school English
 
05:31:35.470 --> 05:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
teacher I was because I'm in English uh
 
05:31:39.150 --> 05:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
I was asked to come in and guest teach
 
05:31:41.670 --> 05:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh I had a blast I was there for two
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
weeks and I loved it it was wonderful
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I was
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
stunned I was stunned at the cell phone
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
use um my son we'd been in the community
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
for a long time so everybody knew me and
 
05:31:58.230 --> 05:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
so you know some students would take out
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
their cell phone uh and then as soon as
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
I would look up they would you know
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
sorry Miss Piper you know that sort of
 
05:32:08.830 --> 05:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
thing um and I just I guess I just want
 
05:32:10.750 --> 05:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
to take this from the perspective of a
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
college professor um that we say that we
 
05:32:18.030 --> 05:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
want the best for our students uh and
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you that when our children
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
get to the college level this is just
 
05:32:23.718 --> 05:32:25.350 align:start position:0%
get to the college level this is just
simply

05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
simply
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
unacceptable they there's we don't have
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
to deal and I mean this very
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully because I'm a parent myself
 
05:32:33.548 --> 05:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to deal with angry
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
parents we don't have to deal with that
 
05:32:37.390 --> 05:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
sort of thing you know we're being paid
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
to Del deliver a product um and to help
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
our students that in the case of where I
 
05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
taught uh were paying paying pretty
 
05:32:51.390 --> 05:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
hefty um uh tuition uh but it's a I I
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a tremendous wakeup call for
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
students when they get to the college
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
level and and that's why she had asked
 
05:32:59.830 --> 05:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
me to come in was to give them a slice
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
of life this is what you can expect next
 
05:33:04.510 --> 05:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
year and this is not going to be
 
05:33:08.430 --> 05:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
happening um and so I just wanted to add
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
that additional information and when I
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
was in the state house we banned
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:21.868 --> 05:33:21.878 align:start position:0%
welcome while driving while driving
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh right yes well driving yeah
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry I was wondering why
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
nobody said anything I thought I thought
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
I did a really good job that was
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan folks you you shocked a few
 
05:33:36.270 --> 05:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
people with that yes yeah I apologize
 
05:33:39.390 --> 05:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much and
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
05:33:41.160 --> 05:33:42.350 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
sticking

05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
sticking
 
05:33:56.868 --> 05:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
house okay good afternoon chairman
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
cordelli I'm glad to be back in front of
 
05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
the house education policy committee um
 
05:34:05.670 --> 05:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
I am the President of the American
 
05:34:07.750 --> 05:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
05:34:10.230 --> 05:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
and uh want to say that president Gary
 
05:34:12.270 --> 05:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
Hoffman uh who spoke onal of the
 
05:34:14.350 --> 05:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
Nashville teachers union he is president
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
of our largest uh affiliate in the state
 
05:34:20.670 --> 05:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
so I glad to hear him um we are here in
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
support of this proposed Bill we think
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
Banning cell phone use would be a good
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
state law to pass to set parameters for
 
05:34:33.788 --> 05:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
all school districts to adopt local
 
05:34:35.788 --> 05:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
policies we think it is needed because
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
not all school districts have adopted
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
local policies um they should be clear
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
parameters so that we know what will go
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
into those policies so we have the
 
05:34:46.510 --> 05:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
needed exceptions for um students with
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh you know for those
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
medical issues where they need to have
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
the phone for uh you the glucose monitor
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever else they have on the phone
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
um English language Learners who are
 
05:34:58.628 --> 05:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
using it to help them um you know
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
because no one else speaks that language
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
in the school um but the parameters
 
05:35:06.270 --> 05:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
should be there um but we do think it is
 
05:35:08.548 --> 05:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
something that would perhaps embolden
 
05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
maybe some school districts where they
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
have not yet adopted a policy because
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
cellones are a distraction in the
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
classroom you have the whole world right
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
here and some students can't um manage
 
05:35:25.150 --> 05:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
their own desire to see what's going on
 
05:35:27.868 --> 05:35:27.878 align:start position:0%
in the outside world with their friends
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
it increases their distraction it fuels
 
05:35:33.868 --> 05:35:33.878 align:start position:0%
their anxiety it is not good for their
 
05:35:33.878 --> 05:35:34.628 align:start position:0%
their anxiety it is not good for their
their

05:35:34.628 --> 05:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
well-being um yeah they want to know
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
what they're friends are saying right
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
now or if they've missed out on a
 
05:35:43.230 --> 05:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
comment or or something you know
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
something a friend has said it um it
 
05:35:48.510 --> 05:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
intensifies conflicts between students
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
because someone has said something that
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
they take offense at or has not liked
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
something that they have posted and it
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
just it spirals it causes so many
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings um intensifies
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts between students it decreases
 
05:36:06.670 --> 05:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
peer engagement and communication
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
because they don't actually talk to each
 
05:36:11.430 --> 05:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
other during the times when they do have
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
um social time at school such as lunch
 
05:36:16.030 --> 05:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the hallways so it be really
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
beneficial for both students and staff
 
05:36:20.910 --> 05:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
because you would have more of their
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
focus when you're teaching they'd be
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
more available to actually learn the
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
content so for those reasons we support
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
you passing this to give all of our
 
05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
school boards the parameters they need
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
to pass good policies on a local level
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we can give our input in our
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
communities uh for exactly what well-
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
defined exceptions they need and uh you
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
know how to best craft the uh pieces of
 
05:36:50.270 --> 05:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
the policy that are done at the local
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
level and that's all I have to say thank
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
you very much any
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Hall thank
 
05:36:59.548 --> 05:36:59.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
question do you does the AFT support
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
Bell to Bell I didn't quite hear the
 
05:37:08.830 --> 05:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
Bell to bell bell to Bell
 
05:37:12.070 --> 05:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
um we feel that that could be the most
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
effective way to do it so that the
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
students are actually um
 
05:37:21.150 --> 05:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
socializing with each other you know at
 
05:37:24.990 --> 05:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
lunchtime and at passing time but again
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to leave that to a local
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
school district decision we will be okay
 
05:37:33.548 --> 05:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
with that as well um we understand that
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the nasua school uh
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
teachers had a different opinion and
 
05:37:40.150 --> 05:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're more focusing on what's actually
 
05:37:41.190 --> 05:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
classroom we we could be happy either
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
way with that but what we really want is
 
05:37:47.310 --> 05:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
some strong parameters that school
 
05:37:49.590 --> 05:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
boards have to come up with a policy and
 
05:37:52.430 --> 05:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
at least limit it in the classroom and
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
it not be an individual teachers
 
05:37:57.548 --> 05:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
decision and individual teachers having
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
it follow follow yes um so given that so
 
05:38:06.070 --> 05:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
the part of the language that says uh
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
the exception to student use when an
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
educator is using devices as part of a
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
lesson plan is that kind of problematic
 
05:38:14.548 --> 05:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
that that probably shouldn't be there
 
05:38:16.510 --> 05:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
because now you're going to put one
 
05:38:17.708 --> 05:38:17.718 align:start position:0%
teacher against another you know some
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
teacher says oh yeah we're going to use
 
05:38:20.590 --> 05:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
it today but not really you know just
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
kind of you would have to have a very
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
clearly worded policy that says you know
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
the whole school says the phones can
 
05:38:29.548 --> 05:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
only be used when it's part of a lesson
 
05:38:29.558 --> 05:38:32.590 align:start position:0%
only be used when it's part of a lesson
plan

05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.230 --> 05:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
so I I guess that would mean the lesson
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
you would have to like have the lesson
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
plan in advance something it would have
 
05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
to be planned in advance it would not be
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
just happening oh on the spur of the
 
05:38:43.230 --> 05:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
moment you're all going to have your
 
05:38:46.230 --> 05:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
phones up but I we all plan in evance
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
anyway so okay thank you yeah any
 
05:38:52.390 --> 05:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
further questions see none thank you I
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
did see represent lfi oh represent
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
litfield thank thank you and thank you
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just related
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
to what you were just talking about uh
 
05:39:05.750 --> 05:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
just in the superintendent I mentioned
 
05:39:08.350 --> 05:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
it as well my concern for lack of a
 
05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
better way some phones way of putting it
 
05:39:13.230 --> 05:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
but some people will have phones some
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
people some people believe it or not
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't have phones I'm wondering in your
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
opinion wouldn't it make sense just to
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
strike that completely for instruct you
 
05:39:23.468 --> 05:39:23.478 align:start position:0%
know what I mean um on a Case by case
 
05:39:26.468 --> 05:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
basis H let me rephrase that I'm talking
 
05:39:28.030 --> 05:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
about using it for instructional
 
05:39:29.990 --> 05:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
purposes because most of the schools
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
they do have some type of a Chromebook
 
05:39:33.990 --> 05:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
or an iPad it will have filters for
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
example to keep out let's say
 
05:39:39.310 --> 05:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
pornography Etc not all children or kids
 
05:39:41.708 --> 05:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
have a cell phone or it's not Equitable
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
in that sense I just don't agree with
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
them using their personal devices so I'm
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if we just strike it all
 
05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
together what your opinion is on that I
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually agree that they should be using
 
05:39:56.750 --> 05:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
a school provided device yeah I do not
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
know if we have sufficiently funded all
 
05:40:02.430 --> 05:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
of our schools so that they are
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
providing onetoone Chromebooks so that's
 
05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
more question on all of
 
05:40:10.990 --> 05:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
you have you done that
 
05:40:14.430 --> 05:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
yet and um you've heard me ask this you
 
05:40:17.788 --> 05:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
know question before um those of you who
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
have been here have are we sufficiently
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
funding all of our Public Schools so
 
05:40:23.110 --> 05:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
that every student in the state is
 
05:40:24.788 --> 05:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
getting the same robust opportunity for
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
a public education we really do need to
 
05:40:29.190 --> 05:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
be doing that because it's not fair for
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
a student in you know Cold Brook to get
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
a different education than a student in
 
05:40:35.910 --> 05:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
in Bedford they're all our Granite State
 
05:40:39.468 --> 05:40:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.948 --> 05:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um appreciate you
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
being here and
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh that uh ends our day today and uh
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
since we did a good job you can have
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
