00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
is we have some technical support here
 
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
today on the aeronautical Bill Institute
 
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be 260 SB 216. let

we
know

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 align:start position:0%

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
already I don't have that and they don't
 
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
give me anything here okay SB 24 is what
 
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
we'll take up first here and we're going
 
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
to go into the executive session rather
 
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
than posting another hearing we've
 
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
oftentimes taken technical support
 
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
during exec sessions if we had questions
 
00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
and so what I want to do is open up SB
 
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
24 and there were some technical
 
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
questions which were asked when we were
 
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 align:start position:0%
in this previously
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh discussing this on was it April

time flies when we're having fun doesn't
 
00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 align:start position:0%
it and and uh the technical questions
 
00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
were more aligned with uh what's been
 
00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
done with a higher education uh
 
00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 align:start position:0%

time this morning Steve Appleby director
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
of educator support and higher education
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education one of my
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
roles is to support the higher education
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
commission it's one of the programs that
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
I oversee at the department from a
 
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
process standpoint the process for
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
approving a new institution begins with
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
the Department performing a review team
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
of which in this case
 
00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
Dean Stanley was uh the the chair of
 
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
that team and we asked the prospective
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
institution to submit
 
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
um well there's a series of documents
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
that line up to the standards in our
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and those standards
 
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
track very closely to Nichi standards
 
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
the regional accreditor for for New
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
England and uh
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
as Dean Stanley leads the review team
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
they look at those standards they
 
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
interview faculty they interview of
 
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
course the administration they look at
 
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 align:start position:0%
finances they look at curriculum
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
facilities if that applies Library all
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
those types of things you would expect
 
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
from a college and the review team then
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations to both the
 
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
prospective institution as well as to
 
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
in this instance the review team made a
 
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
number of recommendations the
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
prospective College implemented those
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
recommendations and reported back to the
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
review team at that point the review
 
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 align:start position:0%
team was satisfied and recommended
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
next up the prospective College
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
presented to the commission and the
 
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
commission looked at the report
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
generated by the review team and voted
 
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
unanimously to approve uh the
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
institution so there were very few
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions in this case the
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
administration is known shall we say Dr
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
Flores was Dean Dean Daniel Webster
 
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.930 align:start position:0%
Flores was Dean Dean Daniel Webster
College

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 align:start position:0%
College
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
dean of Aviation at Daniel Webster
 
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
College he's also a commercial pilot and
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
very involved in this industry they
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
presented quite a bit of information to
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
support the need for this degree in the
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
marketplace which the commission was
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
pleased to see so that's kind of the
 
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
overall process it took
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
probably a little over a year from start
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
to finish of course it took them a lot
 
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
longer right but it took from a
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission standpoint from the first
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
presentation through the review and then
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
through the final vote took a little
 
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
over a year
 
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.129 align:start position:0%
over a year
so

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions about the question questions
 
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.870 align:start position:0%
questions about the question questions
for

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.810 align:start position:0%
for
theoe

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair thank you for taking a
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
question when the program was at Daniel
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
Webster it was a full component of that
 
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
Webster it was a full component of that
area

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
avionics and other programs at the
 
00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 align:start position:0%
college right
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that there was no
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
avionics uh Daniel Webster there were
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
there were three programs three
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
undergraduate programs one was flight
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
operations the other one was Aviation
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
management and the third one was air
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
traffic management uh there was an
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
airframe and power plant program as it's
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
called which contains avionics which is
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
done at Nashua Community College on all
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
of those programs were accredited and
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
fully approved as at Daniel Webster that
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
were simply brought forward uh there
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
were they have not been brought forward
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
no uh Daniel Webster seized operations
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay and some parts of the school were
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
acquired by Southern New Hampshire
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
University some some programs uh one of
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
them was actually Aviation however
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University did
 
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 align:start position:0%
not continue on on that program
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
and it was at that time that when we saw
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
how things were moving forward me and
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%

um the school some of them prior to the
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh closure of the school uh and we
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
decided to to uh restart uh the aviation
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
programs in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
uh for for two different reasons uh one
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
is because as
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
executive director Appleby mentioned the
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
industry right now or the need as far as
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
the industry is concerned it's very
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
robust both in the United States and
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
globally and and secondly because we
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to maintain that history
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
the rich history of an institution and
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
we acquired the name New England
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
aeronautical Institute which is really
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
how things got started for Daniel
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
Webster before there was Daniel Webster
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
there was New England aeronautical
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
Institute so that was a name that we
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually took over and we are rebuilding
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
this we're trying to rebuild this Rich
 
00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:07.259 align:start position:0%
history based on that original name it's
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
been around since 1965.
 
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I may uh if I just want
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
one more piece of information in terms
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
of uh those those other colleagues
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
um uh one of them is Tom teller who is
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
at MIT Lincoln lab he went to as a as a
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
chief research scientist at MIT Lincoln
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
lab after he left Daniel Webster the
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
other one is Nick bertozi who is a
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
professor at Worcester Polytechnic
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
Institute and the third one is John
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
Slater uh who is um who started his own
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
business it's called Uh Vision energy
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
home so he's a he's a home builder in
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so I just
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I wish you knew
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
who are the four people that were
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
involved me and the other three in
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
getting this thing started again thank
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock do you have
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
a question are you cheer on that thank
 
00:08:59.810 --> 00:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
you yeah good morning good morning
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um Scott when uh Sigmund came
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
a few years ago uh in the car in the in
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
the dialogue of their reports they
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
present you were presented a through the
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
commission a listing of things that they
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
that were suspect in terms that we
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
hadn't finished completed
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and we have not at least I have not
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
and I may be a Miss but I have not seen
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
anything like that so my question is are
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
there still areas that have not been
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
completed or is that chat graph you use
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
typically filled if you know what I mean
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you I can I can speak to
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
that so uh
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
interestingly two very very different
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
colleges right
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
um and in this case
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
um New England iron article has
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
fulfilled substantially all of the all
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
I don't say conditions because that's
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
too strong but conditions that that the
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
review team
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
um uh laid out in their report and at
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
this point any AI has fulfilled all of
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
those okay and in fact
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
um is much further ahead in the process
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
in many ways than we than than really
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
Sigma was when when they came for a
 
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
Sigma was when when they came for a
program

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and and for me it's not a
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
question but it's the comment um I'm
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
gonna support the program and uh just as
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
a CTE person uh sau9 where I'm from has
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
an aviation program in the high school
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
and works out of Eastern Slope uh in
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
Freiburg and it's really going great
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
guns catching on yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
reps Damon do you have did you have your
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and good morning
 
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.990 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and good morning
everyone

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I was just curious for a little
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
further history did the pre-existing New
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
England aeronautical Institute Grant
 
00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:48.110 align:start position:0%
England aeronautical Institute Grant
degrees

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
as far as I know yes
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then if I may
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
pulled it into Danny Webster uh yes or
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
it was renamed I became Daniel Webster
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
because uh The Institute was it started
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
as a flight school and then it um
 
00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339 align:start position:0%
uh it became a a degree grounding
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
institution but um the reason why I'm
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
hesitant to answer your question
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
directly it's because there's no
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
definitive history in regards to that
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
some people are are there even right now
 
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:24.500 align:start position:0%
that they have degrees they may be
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
associate degrees and not Baccalaureate
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
degrees so that's why I'm not exactly
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
sure but yes they did have degree
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
granting Authority thank you
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes represent Myler and then represent
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
cascadden thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
you for being here to help clarify
 
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
Arkansas some of our questions
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Appleby presented to us on the
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
29th of uh March indicating that this
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
program is primarily an aviation
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
Management program is that that's
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
correct am I correct in uh it is an
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
aviation program I wouldn't uh classify
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
it as an aviation Management program but
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's definitely an aviation program but
 
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's not a pilot training program it is
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
definitely not a pilot training program
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's not a program that focuses on
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
training commercial pilots
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
that's your question right right yeah we
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
don't train up well if I may there are
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
two components in training a
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
professional pilot one is a academic
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
component and the other one is an actual
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
flight training component so the
 
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
Institute is not involved in Flight
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
Training at all it's a it's an academic
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's a college uh it's a uh it's a
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
college that focuses on providing
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
undergraduate education with focus in
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
aviation and and Mr Appleby indicated
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
that that you are strongly capitalized
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
could you explain what that means
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
I would think
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
it relates to two different sorts of
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
Capital One is human capital which I
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
think we are very strongly capitalized
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the other one is uh Financial
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
Capital which I also think we are we're
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
strongly capitalized what we did was we
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
we try to focus our efforts based on
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
very prudent strategic planning based on
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
best practices so as far as human
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
capital is concerned the chair of our
 
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:33.260 align:start position:0%
board is George
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
Antonio's owns the largest Aviation
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
company Aviation related company in New
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
England not just in the state of New
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's based out of of Peace So
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
he actually is the chair of our board I
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
mentioned the other three members so of
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the board we have the Provost of the
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire as a member
 
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
of our board
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
we have other people from
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
academics or when the Hyatt the member
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
of our board who is in charge of Co-op
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
at University of Massachusetts Lowell uh
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and um we also have uh Senator Susie on
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
on our board as well as a professor from
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
the University of Texas uh who is
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
actually a management strategy professor
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
and the executive director of Kappa
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
Kappa is the Coalition of airline pilots
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
Association so it's basically the union
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
that represents all pilots in the United
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
States uh and interestingly enough even
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
though she's based in DC she's from New
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire she's originally from New
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and very eager to to help
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
support this initiative so so we're I
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
believe in terms of uh human capital in
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
terms of as reflected on our board we
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
are very strongly capitalized because we
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
have people with Aviation experience
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
with higher education experience with
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know industry experience and
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
international experience as well as far
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
as finances are concerned uh what we
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
decided to do is basically
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
take a prudent approach as far as
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
financial management is concerned so to
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
to spend what we need no more and that's
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
really what we have done so we've been
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
very prudent in our spending and we have
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
not acquired nor do we plan to acquire
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
any debt in building out the Institute
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
so uh the people that have actually
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
financed the the Endeavor is is a is the
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
owner of a flight school uh who is also
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
a member of our board as well as Mr
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
antoniadis who I mentioned before uh so
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
this is where we have drawn and and some
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
of our personal funds as well because we
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
believe in the initiative but this is
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
where we've drawn the um the capital uh
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we have
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh we have secured a surety bond with an
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
insurer so that and we already have that
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
even though we don't have any students
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
yet but we do have the bond in place uh
 
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.220 align:start position:0%
so that we protect potentially
 
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
especially in the first years of
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
operation uh students that um
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
would enroll in The Institute I hope
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
I've answered your question yeah you
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
you've gone beyond the my question but
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
but you have answered you have answered
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
one of the questions because I was
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
wondering about the Fidelity Bond yes
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues that this
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
committee has had to deal with is to
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that if something from a fiscal
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh the institution would
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
cease to exist we don't want to have
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
students who are then uh who are then
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
out uh their uh tuition so thank you for
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
that clarification the other question I
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
have too is I'm assuming based is this
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
is this a four-year program so that
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
somebody at the end receives a Bachelor
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
of Arts degree yes sir yes Bachelor of
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
Science and how many students are you
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
anticipating to be engaged in this uh
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
program we have right now recruited five
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
students uh to to run a pilot program no
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
pun intended to just basically test the
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
um uh the the our our educational uh
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
model to test our technology uh to
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
basically test the way that um uh we are
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
planning on running the institution so
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
so these five people are aware that they
 
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.789 align:start position:0%
so these five people are aware that they
are

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
um the uh in the in a group of um of of
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
pilot testing this uh this program uh we
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
actually think it's going to be a very
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
successful program uh in the future I
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
can tell you about my experience with
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster and things have moved
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
forward significantly since the Daniel
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
Webster times but the reason why I was
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
recruited to be the dean of Aviation
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
Sciences at the Fairly young age at
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster it was my experience with
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
distributive education with the with the
 
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.710 align:start position:0%
distributive education with the with the
uh

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
hybrid program is called at Concordia
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
University I was a director of a
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
master's degree program at Concordia
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
University which was hybrid and that was
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
a very successful program
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
um Concordia in Canada in Montreal and
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
at Daniel Webster for a master's degree
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
program in
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
2007 because it's when it got started
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the second year we had 100 students so
 
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.070 align:start position:0%
the second year we had 100 students so
here

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
what online education means in today's
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
world is totally different than what it
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
meant in 2007 so the potential for
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
online education is more significant
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
right now here we have a bachelor's
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
degree program so the the the group of
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
people that could potentially draw from
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
is enormous and Daniel Webster's efforts
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
were focused on the U.S market not on
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
the international market our efforts are
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to be focusing on the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
international market actually our
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
curriculum is so incredibly unique
 
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419 align:start position:0%
nobody else has it because nobody else
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
can actually do it we have combined the
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
thinking of the Federal Aviation
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
Administration in regards to flight
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
operations training and the European
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
Aviation safety Association uh nobody
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
can do this not even Embry little
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
Aeronautical University which is uh a
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
very very important University as far as
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
Aviation education is concerned so we
 
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.370 align:start position:0%
Aviation education is concerned so we
think

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry representative Miller I'm
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
an academic so when you're giving me the
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
floor I tend to uh perhaps speak a
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
little too too much but um so we think
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's going to be successful because
 
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.590 align:start position:0%
it's going to be successful because
without

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
without any effort we have five students
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
when we actually started when we
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
um when we have our website live our
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
website exists and and the folks at the
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission have actually seen it uh but
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's not live because we don't want it
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
to be live until we have approval
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
through the legislature we want to be
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
very very careful in regards to this
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
after we run our pilot testing and we
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
work through the Kinks the issues that
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're sure actually exist despite the
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
fact that we think it's a very um
 
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:24.980 align:start position:0%
um uh a very Noble and Innovative
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum and approach we will use
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
social media we will advertise we will
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
use business to business we already are
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
in touch with Kappa as I said before
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
Coalition of airline pilots Association
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
we're in touch with United Airlines
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
through their AB initial program called
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
aviate and they're actually eager to
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
work with us as well as with several
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
organizations outside of the United
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
States so this has the potential of of
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
attracting hundreds of students in the
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
future thank you just one final question
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
as a graduate of your program
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
what will I be able what kind of job
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
will I be able to get thank you very
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
much as a graduate of the program uh you
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
could be an airline pilot this is a
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
highly sought and very professional
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
um occupation so essentially uh however
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be offering pilot
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
training but if a pilot receives their
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
training let's say Nigeria or in at the
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
Concord airport at the flight school at
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
Concord airport uh we will be offering a
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
credit for that
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise they will take the grounds
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
portion that's what I mentioned before
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
not the flight portion just the the
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
academic portion uh with us so they can
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
they can become Pilots airline pilots
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
corporate Pilots flight instructors or
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
they could work in management functions
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
for an airline for a corporate Aviation
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
um for for manufacturer uh and actually
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
we have one of the five students is a

flight attendant uh she she works as a
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
um we would like to launch in uh in
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:55.580 align:start position:0%
finishing with our pilot testing and
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that everything is in order
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
by the way we've already recruited The
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
Faculty uh the fact we have been trained
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
in our model so we're ready to go in
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
terms of that and we're building
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
um some of the details in of the of the
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh yes absolutely we would
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
like to
um

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
we would like to uh work with high
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
schools and um
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
um the representative before mentioned a
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
high school and Innovation program in a
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
local high school I was part of the
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
effort to create uh these types of
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
programs in New Hampshire high schools
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I've done this in Canada and I've
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
done this in Greece and I've been a
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
major supporter of stem education with
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
an Aeronautics Focus starting at a young
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
age I've worked with aopa which is the
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
aircraft owners and piles Association
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
towards that endeavor here in the United
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
States uh Daniel Webster we had Ace
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
camps from the FAA that we brought high
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
school students on campus but this is
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
even better the campus goes to the
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
student rather than the student having
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
to go to the campus and so yes the
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
simple answer to your great question is
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely high school students are
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
incredibly important they're the future
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as I'm concerned they need to
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
start understanding ending the industry
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
and the industry that needs to be much
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
more inclusive
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh which is but it needs to be even more
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
and to do that you have to go to 11 year
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
olds and uh and show them what they can
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
actually do uh and and get them started
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh from uh from there so yes and and we
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to do this we want the the New
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire name to be or the the quality
 
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
of higher education the reputation of
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
the quality of higher education in New
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not only to be maintained but
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
to be enhanced through our our efforts
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
uh because I think one of the advantages
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
we have is that we don't have any Legacy
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
structures or costs or or anything
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
everything is new and and we look
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
towards uh the future so again yes high
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
schools are incredibly important for us
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
but we're also there for professionals
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there are a lot of
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
people around the world that fly the
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
planes you fly in as passengers that do
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
not have bachelor's degrees
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh because the industry is so dynamic
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
they found jobs before they were able to
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
complete their degrees or they never did
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
um some of them if they lose their
 
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.769 align:start position:0%
um some of them if they lose their
medical

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
they they're high school graduate so a
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
lot of these people would like to have
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
this degree and again a lot of these
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
people are not just here in the US or in
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
they're all over the world and and
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to capture so
 
00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:41.299 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much for your question
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you and
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question really
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
for the expertise regarding this issue
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you were an online
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
institution based in Hollis New
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also that you do not have
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
degree granting or priority at least not
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
at this point in other states would that
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
limit students from other states from
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
taking part in this if you had say a
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts name Vermont et cetera
 
00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:08.539 align:start position:0%
resident who wanted to get a degree from
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
neaai would they still be able to
 
00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
neaai would they still be able to
um

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic question and I can
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
maybe start answering but uh executive
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
director Appleby uh can definitely um
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
answer to the the more structural issues
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of that by the way our we
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
filed our initial paperwork the five
 
00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:31.909 align:start position:0%
filed our initial paperwork the five
friends

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I I really dare to say this uh
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
because that's really we're five friends
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
that did the initial paperwork for the
 
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
that did the initial paperwork for the
Institute

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
Institute
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
um over three years ago now
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
um using uh just a residential address
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
but our address right now is uh 101
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
flight Line Road in in Portsmouth New
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's at PACE Air Force Base
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
so so this is the the base of this
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
institution of this institute is peace
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
Air Force Base which is really the
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
center it or it should be the center of
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
Aviation activity as far as the state of
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is concerned
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
um there is a uh a federal law which is
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
which called NC Sarah which we are not
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
not going to participate right away so
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
we will be available for New Hampshire
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
residents to to register initially as
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
well as residents from other states that
 
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.140 align:start position:0%
are not signatories to NC Sarah
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
we cannot participate in NC Sarah yet
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
because you have to be accredited before
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
you do the paperwork to participate in
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
NC Sarah so if a resident of a state
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
that and this will be disclosed on our
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
website but if a resident of a state
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is NC Sarah signatory
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
applies then unfortunately we won't be
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
able to admit that individual follow-up
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
please yes
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
are so this is New England's
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
aeronautical Institute are the other New
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
England states a part of that and would
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
the students from those States be able
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative so uh the the Sarah
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
agreement encompasses 49 states
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
currently uh the state of California is
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
not a signatory to the agreement and
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
really what what Sarah allows
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
institutions uh to do is not go state by
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
state to receive approval for their
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
degree uh in the in the case of any AI
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to enroll students from
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they would need to seek
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
approval from the state of Massachusetts
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
it isn't degree granting approval like
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
this but every state and we have the
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
same process here in New Hampshire every
 
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.769 align:start position:0%
same process here in New Hampshire every
state

00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
um has their own framework shall we say
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
and rules around approving out-of-state
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
programs if they're signatory to Sarah
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
and the institution that's remote to
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
that state is a signatory to Sarah well
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
then that's all that needs to happen and
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
they're approved to operate in that
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
state however for us we get a
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
significant number of california-based
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
Institutions will want to offer an
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
online program here in New Hampshire and
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
the higher education conducts a review
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
of that program and then approves
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
or doesn't approve that program to be
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
offered in New Hampshire but that's just
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
California every other state is a member
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
of Sarah and so in the case of any AI if
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
they did not yet have
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
um accreditation and therefore could not
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
be a signatory to Sarah they then would
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
seek approval individually state by
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
state okay so and that's an additional
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
process more paperwork that's yep and
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
they would go and that would involve us
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire except to confirm
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
what we've already done right but other
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
than that it's up to Massachusetts
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island and so forth
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%

group of main recommendations
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
when you're cheering this how would you
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
rate this application in terms of some
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the other situations we've gone
 
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.750 align:start position:0%
of the other situations we've gone
through

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations or
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
issues that she received or seen well I
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
think we look at each other these
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
institutions a little bit differently as
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
we look at it I will say this about this
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
is definitely a startup and I think we
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
looked at it as a startup it's
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
it's got issues that we are going to
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
have to be dealt with with uh faculty
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
and it's got issues it's going to have
 
00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:38.059 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with financially
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
but we looked at the board we looked at
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
the all the elements of how they did
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
their plan
 
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.340 align:start position:0%
and we asked a lot of questions
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
also had to do with what their financial
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
situation is and I think that's a
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
bootstrap in some ways as it goes
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
forward but I want to tell you after we
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
had a discussion we voted for it
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
unanimously so how would I rate it
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
against the others it's so different
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
than some of the other institutions that
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
we consider that it's sometimes
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to do a comparison from one or
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
the other what we really look at is what
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
results of the study and what have they
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
done to prepare to be able to offer a
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
good solid education for their students
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
and when we went through that they
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
looked very good but they're still to be
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
proven I mean this is really an early
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
process I I don't want to mislead
 
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
anybody to say this isn't like an
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
established institution somewhere
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
wanting to start something in New
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is an institution that is
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
really starting pretty much from the
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
ground up but with a lot of skill sets
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
brought from a lot of different areas to
 
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:58.460 align:start position:0%
make it so that we felt like as a as a
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
commission that they had brought the
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
skill sets together to be successful in
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
their Endeavor and they also feel what
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
we consider to be a whole in some of the
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
educational environment that's out there
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
so the combination of what they were
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
doing the novelty of of how they're
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
approaching it the need in that area and
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
the quality of the individuals they have
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
brought together to run and set this up
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
assured us that they had what was needed
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be successful now we're going to have
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
to check with them from time to time to
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
monitor their progress but I think it's
 
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:42.020 align:start position:0%
hard to compare it against another
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
institution that might want to do some
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
things here because it's so original in
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
its idea and concept but I think they
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
are well prepared for what they're
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and do
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
again for uh for joining us uh here this
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
morning and and uh and I know you have a
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of things on your your agenda a
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
lot of things to do
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
um uh just a couple of a couple of
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh one of them actually when
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
did I guess when do you expect to
 
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:21.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
we are going to start accreditation for
 
00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
we are going to start accreditation for
us

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.269 align:start position:0%
us
um

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
right now or I think internet
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
accreditation is twofold one is Aviation
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
accreditation uh there is uh an
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
organization called Abby Aviation
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
accreditation board International uh
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
we've already started a discussion with
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
them uh and uh to be able to actually
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
start the process of accreditation you
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
have to have at least one graduate so
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's not something that can happen
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
overnight uh and the other one is
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
business education commission and the
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
process is uh also very similar so our
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
effort starts
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
has already started towards these two
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
accreditations that will be uh important
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
but it will be a process just like uh
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory process here uh it's going to
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
be a process but we're prepared for it
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
by the way I'm a member of the Board of
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
Trustees of of Abby uh and I've worked
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
on nature accreditation before uh very
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
successfully for also another startup
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
institution I worked on and my my
 
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues also the academics are very
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh with this process
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
um so uh it should be yeah it's it's a
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
process and uh we have to have at least
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
one graduate to get it started okay and
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
then and then a follow-up to that Mr
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
chair actually I think um goes to uh Dr
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Burks or um or Mr Appleby with respect
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
to the the higher education uh
 
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.629 align:start position:0%
to the the higher education uh
commission

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
um uh doctor you talked about how you
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
you follow the
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
um the schools that have applied for um
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
granting Authority you know through the
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
process because obviously this is
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know one of the one of the early
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
steps and there's a lot more year
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
potentially years more
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
um uh steps
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
ahead of us and you've you've described
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
um uh any AI as a startup and I think
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
that's a fair a fair
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
um uh way to describe it and without
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
making any you know negative aspersions
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
on things I've been involved with
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
startups before some of them take off no
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
pun intended uh others um you know I
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
will avoid using the the crash word but
 
00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:43.550 align:start position:0%
will avoid using the the crash word but
uh

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.470 align:start position:0%
uh
um

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
but um but but should things not
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um you know you know not continue down
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
the road
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
um how do what what what steps does the
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
higher education commission
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
um take at that point now that the state
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
has has approved degree granting
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
Authority and I'm just wondering what
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
what happens when during the breakup
 
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
what happens when during the breakup
start

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
I'll let Steve say some more but I'd say
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
from our perspective this is like the
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
first or second bite out of the Apple
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and what we have to do is track that
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
process and and see how they're
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
succeeding as time goes on I think we
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
have another session later in the year
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
where we get together with them so
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
um it's not an unfamiliar process that
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
we go through to check out institutions
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
because there are institutions that have
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
struggled from time to time and we
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
review them and make suggestions and
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
then we make decisions on how to go
 
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:47.060 align:start position:0%
forward uh Stephen
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question all they
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
would add to to that is we have a number
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
of Institutions both in state and out of
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
state that we require an annual report
 
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.069 align:start position:0%
state that we require an annual report
from

00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
for the commission and that in your
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
report you know could be just a and even
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
current institutions that have a new
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
program that's a new degree outside of
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
their their functional area
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
um they provide us a new report that
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
talks about how many students finances
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
um outcomes and that annual report gets
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
filed with the commission every year and
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the in this case it would be a rather
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
extensive report versus just one
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
particular degree from an existing
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
institution which might be two pages you
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
know we would expect to see a multi-page
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
report really addressing every single
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
standard in our administrative rules and
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
how their progress is tracking towards
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
those standards and those are the
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
standards that line up with netchi
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
standards as well and then just just to
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
make sure I I understand this again this
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
really has nothing it's not specific to
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
any AI but I I think it's more more
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
specific to the process of approving
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
um degree granting Authority since we
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't do this very very much in this
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee I mean we've we've probably
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
heard 300 bills since um since the last
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
time over the period of years here in
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
the 15 years I've been here we have
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
approved a number of authorized yeah a
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
number of Institutions and working with
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
the commission and the commission
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
members uh are are folks which come from
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
all our Public Schools the presidents
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have non-public higher ed
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
involved folks appointed by the governor
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh it's a really
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
um uh uh professional a knowledgeable
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
commission which we've tagged this huge
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to so so I do it yeah so
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
the the question here
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
um is and and I think
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair you you you you laid it out
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
really well when you talked about over
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
the years we've we've had a number of
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
applications uh you know I think uh
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
certainly prior to my time on this
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee and maybe prior to my time
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
being in the legislature I had I had
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
um seen some news reports on on colleges
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
that were granted degree granting a
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
given great degree gramming Authority
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently folded and I was
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
wondering is there a point at which the
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
higher education commission says no long
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
you can no longer operate with any
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm just
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
thinking through
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um there's one example in my 18 years I
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
was on the commission for 10 years prior
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
to coming to the department
 
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:38.300 align:start position:0%
we had one we had one case
 
00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:41.339 align:start position:0%
back around probably a dozen years ago
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
now it was the Italian
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
College I don't know if you were even on
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that was for you so it
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
was a while ago and I'm trying to recall
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how we handled that situation
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
if I recall we never actually approved
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
them as a commission they had applied
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
they had trouble fulfilling requests
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
they had trouble proving finances
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and this went on over the course of
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
several high-red commission meetings But
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
ultimately they were never given degree
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
granting approval
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
um it never even came to the legislature
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
it didn't get out of the commission so
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
should something happen to a to an
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
Institute that has received degree
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
granting approval does that have like
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that that that it gets
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
rescinded by the legislature does it
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
could it be rescinded by the higher
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
education commission this yeah there's a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
couple different points these issues
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
weren't too prevalent maybe 10 years ago
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
they've become a very big part of the
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
accreditation process for every
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
institution right now I think netchi is
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing maybe 100 institutions that
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
are in some state of struggling so as
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
they go through the accreditation
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
process there's not only going to have
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
us looking at them but they're going to
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
have other institutions that are
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
accrediting them looking at these exact
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
issues because
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
they've become such a part of higher
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I just it's kind of an
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
interesting question
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
um why do you call it an Institute
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
rather than a college or a university
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
I've noticed that that there's a
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
aeronautical Institute out of Washington
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
DC and it just seems like to separate
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
yourself you would be a college or a
 
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.849 align:start position:0%
yourself you would be a college or a
university

00:41:30.849 --> 00:41:30.859 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
we focused on on tradition and we wanted
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
to reinstitute
 
00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:39.619 align:start position:0%
the New England aeronautical Institute
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
which was and is known to be a New
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire institution with a long
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
tradition so that's why we called it a
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
an Institute there was no other reason
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever perhaps in the future as NAIA
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
became Daniel Webster we may consider
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
renaming it but it's only for historical
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
reasons and and for no other reason
 
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.210 align:start position:0%
reasons and and for no other reason
whatsoever

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know why is RPI called RPI
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
so yes representative portiello thank
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you all but I
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly who to direct this to
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
um since you're seeking
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know a bachelor degree status
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
um obviously this is not just a
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
technical program
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so what I would like to just hear
 
00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:34.700 align:start position:0%
more about is sort of the
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
non-aeronautical aspects of the
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum sort of do you have a Core
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
Curriculum what does that consist of
 
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.589 align:start position:0%
Curriculum what does that consist of
so

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's uh the curriculum is
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
broken down in three parts very
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
conventional in terms of higher
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
education and the federal guidelines I
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
have been followed in regards to
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
building the curriculum in regards to
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
the proportion of general education
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
versus uh Major versus specialization
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
and these are the three components so
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
one-third of the curriculum is general
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
education one-third is what we call core
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
and the other one third is the uh is the
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
major so gen Ed I'm sure you're very
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with it uh it takes a very uh
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement type approach to um to
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
general education I think it's very
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
forward thinking uh we have arts and we
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
have Sciences as part of that
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
um critical thinking very important
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
history so on and so forth and the
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
second piece is uh the um the the the
 
00:43:46.809 --> 00:43:46.819 align:start position:0%
major the core which is basic basically
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
what everybody
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
just the the general knowledge as far as
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
Aviation is concerned how an airport is
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
run how neural land is run how Air
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
transport management is run about safety
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
risk management security and so on and
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
so forth and the third piece focuses on
 
00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:07.819 align:start position:0%
more specialized
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
information that has to do with flight
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
operations again it has to do with
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory structures it has to do with
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
flight Dynamics aerodynamics things like
 
00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:25.150 align:start position:0%
flight Dynamics aerodynamics things like
that

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's almost ready to Institute
 
00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:30.020 align:start position:0%
the three-minute rule well
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's quick I just I just want
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
clarification and maybe I missed this is
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
this like 100 online now that you're
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
proposing do you have any anticipation
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
of any kind of brick and mortar when I
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
think of like airplanes and stuff I kind
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
of think of like maybe Hands-On
 
00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:44.530 align:start position:0%
of think of like maybe Hands-On
um

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:44.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's only the uh the theoretical part
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
it's only the academic part that we're
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
actually actually focusing on so yes it
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
is online and it's not just online it's
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
as synchros online to be able to uh to
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
focus on that
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
good question thank you so again nobody
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
who graduates
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
will be a pilot just because of
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
graduation they may be a pilot already
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
or they may be somebody who is training
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
to be a pilot and is doing that is doing
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
the theoretical piece
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
um together with that but uh the only
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
actually the only
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um uh course which is
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
um challenging in this type of an
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
environment it's the Physics course it's
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
none of Aviation courses
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
um it's the Physics course and we
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
actually have uh have built a virtual
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
lab for for the Physics course because
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a fundamental very important
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
part of um of general education uh and
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
board International in terms of how this
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
knowledge is structured how these uh
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so too I think related
 
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.290 align:start position:0%
thank you so too I think related
questions

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
how many students do you think you need
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
to be a viable operation and then I'll
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
connect that to the other
 
00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:19.250 align:start position:0%
connect that to the other
um

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
the business model we are using is one
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
that focuses on variable costs there's
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
very little in terms of fixed costs that
 
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:31.460 align:start position:0%
are associated with um with the school
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
so even so every course to be able to
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
run successfully and make a profit needs
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
three students at least three students
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
because all the costs are associated
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
with the instructors instructors get
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
paid by the student and not by the
 
00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.309 align:start position:0%
paid by the student and not by the
course

00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
are a lot of schools in Europe a lot of
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
universities in Europe do that uh and um
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a way to do it so basically
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
if you have 10 students you get paid for
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
10 students you have three students you
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
get paid for three students because you
 
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
don't show up in a classroom and spend
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
an equal amount of time you spend enough
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
time individually with with each of the
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
students going through a um and right
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
now I mean higher education is all about
 
00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:18.980 align:start position:0%
deep expertise it's not about lecturing
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh and you know I hold the knowledge the
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge is everywhere you have to
 
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
guide the students so that's really our
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
our model there so uh to be more direct
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of answering your your question
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh we believe and and the the financials
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
are are available uh that the commission
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
has them uh there's a five-year budget
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's a five-year plan I'm sorry
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's a budget uh there's startup
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
costs and then operational costs that
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
are factored in technology and so on and
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
so forth we expect to be um
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
uh to break even after three years of
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
operation uh with approximately 50
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
students uh and and anything beyond that
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh should be
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
um should be profitable and this profit
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
as a not-for profit will be reinvested
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
in in building this institution because
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
we already have as Strategic Management
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
Theory tells us we already have in our
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
mind a growth plan I mean we actually
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
want to move into uh some other areas of
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
Aviation that we believe we can actually
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
serve but have to start from somewhere
 
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:31.490 align:start position:0%
serve but have to start from somewhere
so

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
related to that then
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
are you confident of the availability of
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the faculty that you need for those
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
numbers of students because I know in
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
unrelated areas of higher ed say nursing
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
lack of Faculty is inhibiting enrollment
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
of students absolutely we are and we
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
already have a Cadre of Faculty which
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
are from from all over the world
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually they're they're uh they're
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
based here in the United States they're
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
based in New Hampshire uh in other
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
states in the U.S in Europe
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh yes uh and because our
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
approach it's not geographically
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
confined and that's why it's easier to
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
be able to uh to tap the talent that we
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
actually need
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.770 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
and

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
as soon as I get hooked up here
 
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
as soon as I get hooked up here
um

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
do you have Provisions already for
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
students transferring say from community
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
colleges and other places to do various
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
parts of your program uh yes sir we do
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
and they are part of our institutional
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
catalog these policies have been written
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
they've been vetted and they've been
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
approved by the higher education
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
commission so the clear answer is
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes and we actually expect
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
quite a few students like that perhaps
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who already has again a
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
commercial pilot's license and no degree
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
they can transfer credit based on that
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
on that license uh somebody coming from
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
a community college or or a high school
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
student who has taken advanced placement
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
courses can can enter in uh so we have a
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
policy that holds its water in terms of
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
the commission as well as in terms of
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
Nazi I mean we took Neches guidelines in
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
regards to uh minimum amount of credits
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh every part for graduation maximum
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
amount of credits transferred uh so so
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's already there
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
questions Representative
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
no three-minute rule applies
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
um so I I was just looking up Abby on
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
the um on online and and looking at
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
their trustees and they've got quite a
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
few trustees obviously representing a
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
lot of very
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
um well-recognized institutions and and
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
companies but I was just wondering is
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
there a concern I know I I see Dr
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
Fleury's name also on the list of
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
trustees and I was wondering is there
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
any conflict given the accreditation
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
being a trustee on the board that is
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
accrediting the the new um uh uh
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
Institute there is not uh because
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm not part of the proceeding if my
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
institution uh goes up for accreditation
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
then I I have to recuse myself and
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
actually interestingly enough uh their
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
their recusals uh even if you uh
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
somebody there let's say is now the dean
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
not uh at Purdue University but got
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
their degree from memory riddle when
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
Embry Riddle is up for pre-acretation
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
that being from Purdue recuses herself
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh because uh she has a degree from an
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
institution that is going up for
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
accreditation so yeah it's a matter of
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'm on the curriculum committee as well
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
so if if anything comes up
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I've I've been I've set
 
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
up like partnership agreements with like
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater State University in
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when they go up for
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
accreditation I recuse myself because
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
I've I've done business with them so but
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
and and that's not really a typical Don
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're president of PSU you are a
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
trustee you are chair of this Commission
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
any conflicts yeah yes you could say
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty incestuous in this
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
head stat there's only so many of us and
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
we serve on these various groups so uh
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
just to use an example nache Keen uh
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
president Melinda serves on that CCA
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
just went through a review process had
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
to recuse herself you know as she went
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
through that process so very usual
 
00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:42.059 align:start position:0%
because they want to have the best
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
expertise on these boards that we're all
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
involved in some ways or another but uh
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
we try to do it in a way in a process so
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
that we not only recuse ourselves but we
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
have to be response to the process and
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
when we go through an accreditation
 
00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.630 align:start position:0%
when we go through an accreditation
process

00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
we bring together experts from all
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
across the universities that are part of
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
us that uh bring all sorts of different
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
viewpoints I just did a review myself
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
and uh I can tell you uh the process and
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
the expertise you bring from different
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
directions uh sure is a pretty balanced
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
review of accreditation
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%

01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would like to
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
introduce a minor amendment to SB 135
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1411h which I did not pass out
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
yet I will do now we have enough oh I'm
 
01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:49.149 align:start position:0%
yet I will do now we have enough oh I'm
sorry

01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
's going around just to be a Time Saver
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
at the bottom all I've added here is uh
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
two sentences
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution shall not
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
be initiated by the state or local
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
Education Agency in circumstances in
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
which the parent Guardian wishes to
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
refuse Services entirely and shall be
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
discontinued upon such refusal and this
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
is just a small
 
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
um change I wanted to make to head off
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
one potential problem I could see I can
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
see a lot of good things in this bill
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
but I have heard from some constituents
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
that because their schools may have
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
decided that they wanted to try to do an
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
IEP or something along that line but a
 
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
parent did not want that to happen that
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
this that in some circumstances the
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
schools have attempted to negotiate with
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
and convince them with over a period of
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
time to do it anyway and I can see this
 
01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:55.340 align:start position:0%
potentially resulting in a circumstance
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
where the school says well we don't have
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
to do it right now but let's just keep
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
talking about it and let's just keep
 
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:05.219 align:start position:0%
talking about it as a something that
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
could happen over a long period of time
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
to draw this out when a parent it really
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to happen so I just I want
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
to make that clarification that if a
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
parent says no that's the final word
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee on
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
that bill representative cascadden
 
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair there's no need for
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
this language because I don't know if
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
you know the IEP process or the special
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
ed process but parents when they don't
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
want to go through a dispute they can
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
sign and refuse Services there's already
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
a form and a process for a parent to
 
01:27:39.719 --> 01:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
a form and a process for a parent to
deny

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
deny
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
either continued Alternatives or
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
continued discussions
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
so there's no need for it
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes I wanted to ask you about that
 
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
um you specifically
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
because you're familiar with this
 
01:28:00.179 --> 01:28:02.209 align:start position:0%
because you're familiar with this
um

01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
in the dispute resolution you know the
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
the law that's in there the the
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
and it does say if it has been rejected
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
by the parent
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
then it establishes a 30-day period for
 
01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.330 align:start position:0%
then it establishes a 30-day period for
discussion

01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
but if the parents is so
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
I guess that made it unclear to me that
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
the parent could absolutely say no and
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't go to this dispute
 
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.570 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't go to this dispute
resolution

01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:37.250 align:start position:0%
resolution
automatically

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
parent can sign a refusal of services at
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
any time based on that and that's very
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
end of it
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
unless they come back and say well now
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
we think they need speech now they
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
should have this they should have that
 
01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.610 align:start position:0%
should have this they should have that
right

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I like and that is
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
my understanding as well
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
um although there are some situations
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
you know may not be capable of making a
 
01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
decision for the but then you wouldn't
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
be really in a dispute situation like
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
this but I in all the years as a school
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
principal I've never experienced a
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
situation if a parent does want to move
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
forward they don't move forward with
 
01:29:15.179 --> 01:29:16.490 align:start position:0%
forward they don't move forward with
anything

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
Becky do you have anything on that at
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
all because you were a director and this
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
we we uh you see was there was there a
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
second on year did you put the the
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
yes I believe I motion the second that I
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if we had a second okay we
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
need that before we can have any
 
01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
discussion on that Amendment we really
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
need to have a second on the amendment
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
did you second it Alicia all right or I
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
oh I can so we can discuss discussion
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
purposes okay
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead Becky uh good morning
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
for the record Becky Wilson director of
 
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
governmental relations for the New
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association uh
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
previously a special education director
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
here in the state for about 20 years
 
01:30:09.010 --> 01:30:09.020 align:start position:0%
um I want to reiterate representative
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
cascadden's point which is
 
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
um there are specific rules around going
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
to due process when there is a
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the parents and the
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
school district for the very first
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
initial evaluation of the child or the
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
first identification the school district
 
01:30:29.689 --> 01:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
has not allowed to pursue due process in
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
that case so if it's the very first time
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
a child's ever been referred you go
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
through the referral process you want to
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
offer the student an IEP and the parent
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
says no you cannot go to due process for
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that it's legally not allowed there are
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
also sometimes though where the district
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
is obligated to get a resolution
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
through the special ed rules so there
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
are times where you can't just let a
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
disagreement hang out there you have to
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
pursue due process in order to get
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
resolution to meet your obligation as a
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
school district so there are very
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
specific situations in which you can and
 
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
cannot as a district file for due
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
process and that would be the only time
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
that a district would pursue something
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
even if the parent didn't want it in
 
01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
terms of resolution not necessarily in
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
terms of doing what the district wants
 
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
versus what the parent wants if that
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
and is this all based on premise on idea
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's based off the federal law and the
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rules also supersede and
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
go beyond sometimes the federal law in
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we exceed a lot of
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
the federal idea with more options from
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr just to clarify when you
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
say due process you're referring here to
 
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
the alternate dispute resolution process
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question the dispute
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
resolution process has multiple parts to
 
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.390 align:start position:0%
resolution process has multiple parts to
it

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
um if a district is going to go to
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
mediation or a parent wants to go to
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
mediation it's still part of the dispute
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
resolution criteria so there was
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork that the parents and the
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
district both have to fill out
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to file for the due
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
process as part of that you would check
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
off as a district and as a parent
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
whether you're willing to try mediation
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
before you go to a due process hearing
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
most often people will do that because
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's a very good chance that you can
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
resolve whatever the issue is in
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
mediation without going all the way
 
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
through to a due process hearing but
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
that's all part of the dispute
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
resolution options
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead just follow up on that so so
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
ultimately there there is no way under
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
current law that should a
 
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
parent refuse or refuse in IEP but the
 
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
school wanted to do it that the school
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
local Education Agency could then
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
initiate the alternative dispute
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
resolution process to try to negotiate
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
um thanks for that question so
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
the district does have an obligation
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
called child find to seek out and find
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and ensure
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
that they are appropriately evaluating
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
those students to the extent that they
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
can with parental consent to offer that
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
child whatever Services they might need
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
to to in order to access their education
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
as part of you know annual evaluations
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
and things that are happening at the
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
classroom level there is a chance that
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
if they've already found that there's
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
some concerns for that child's education
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
they've referred the child they've gone
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
through that process and the parents
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
have said no thank you that the next
 
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
year so to speak maybe there's more
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
evaluations that are done you know as
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
part of classroom learning and there's
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that are again brought up the
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
school district has to respond to the
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
concerns they can't just say well you
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
know three years ago the parents said
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't want this so we're never
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
going to bring it up again that would
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
put the district in a position where
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
they're not really meeting their
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
obligation for that student they would
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
have to at least talk to the parent
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
about their ongoing concerns but the
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
parent still to Repco Adam's point would
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
have to give consent for further
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
evaluations or anything like that the
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
district though for its own liability
 
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
would need to document that they've at
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
least expressed to the parent that
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns in that area so
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
that when that child turns 16 18 they're
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
not saying you know you let us go our
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
entire School career without giving us
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
for represent Woodcock hey chairman this
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
is probably for you sir I just want to
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
be sure
 
01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
um that uh the amendment doesn't negate
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
on the original Bill lines 15 through
 
01:34:34.679 --> 01:34:41.030 align:start position:0%
on the original Bill lines 15 through
19.

01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
I'm specifically concerned about uh with
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
right so this this is only for two and
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't it it's going to be clear it
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
those three lines that's only per
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
section two row number two section two
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
is not changed by this amendment okay
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
the the correct the number the the
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
non-roman numeral two correct I just
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that under in on this
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
initial bill is uh Rook on 7th 1819 then
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
you should agreeable 30 days is still in
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
there it's not the Leader by or negated
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
by this one
 
01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
by this one
right

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Becky you're welcome
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
here I want to make sure I just did not
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
hate that so we have before us the
 
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.450 align:start position:0%
hate that so we have before us the
amendment

01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the men I will
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
just chime in on and support what I as a
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
principal for all those years
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I agree with rep uh representative
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
cascadden that this is a process that if
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
the parent says no that's the red light
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and this is we're done and done
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
yeah this is not yeah so the um so under
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that edition of the
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
the the uh designation of no no more
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
basically is already in law by by
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
federal law by the fair refusing uh and
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
and has nothing to do with I mean this
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
is just like repetitive and not needed
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
the parent walks out of that IEP meeting
 
01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:25.139 align:start position:0%
it is done they sign off right it's done
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
would it be your opinion then it's cheer
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
that those three lines are repetitive
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
well it's it's my opinion and it's just
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
just myself alone that as all those
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
years in school uh teaching in in
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
principleship where we did the
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
intervention process and when the IEP
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
process and
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
we did this regularly and and it was the
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
schools of 400 600 kids uh as a
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
distinguished National principal I have
 
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.610 align:start position:0%
distinguished National principal I have
no

01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh understanding why that would be
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
needed seeing that a parent can say no
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
and that unless there's some extreme
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
situation like the the parent is
 
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and there's you have a
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
foster parent taking your care or
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
something but that parent is treated the
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
same then the state is there so I I
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't understand I don't think it's I
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
think it's duplicate of what we already
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
have in law
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
reps and electives
 
01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.890 align:start position:0%
reps and electives
oh

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
so in making sure that you agree as well
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
and that everybody agrees that there is
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
no way
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
to enter into this alternative dispute
 
01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.410 align:start position:0%
to enter into this alternative dispute
resolution

01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
by anybody if the parent says no
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
it takes two to dance that's what I
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
wanted is that that didn't seem to be
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
exactly what she was saying and so I
 
01:37:53.649 --> 01:37:53.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
but to say all in
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be some
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
exceptions and some situations which
 
01:38:02.159 --> 01:38:03.830 align:start position:0%
exceptions and some situations which
occur

01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
you have something else to add
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
inspirational Services they're not going
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
to pitch it or it says no no because
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
special ed has a lot of hard fast rules
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
but it's also a lot of thinking like
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
special ed as opposed to everything fits
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
in a box
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
the concern I would have personally
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
about the amendment is I understand the
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
intention of that Amendment and I think
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
99 of the time
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
that could not happen however the
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
federal idea and your New Hampshire
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
special ed rules require the district to
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
resolve things sometimes and sometimes
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
the only Avenue the district would have
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
would be to file for due process if the
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
parent was extremely non-responsive if
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
the parent was
 
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
um you know put If the child had already
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
been identified and the school district
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
felt that there was something else that
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
needed to happen and there was just no
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
resolve the district has obligations
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
under Federal idea to make sure that the
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
situation is resolved it's not
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily to force the parent to agree
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
but it is to resolve
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
or have somebody else resolve whatever
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
the disagreement is you can't just as a
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
district say well you know I'm going to
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
wash my hands clean of this and just
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
walk away you have an obligation to that
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
Stu to that student so there are
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
very few situations where the district
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
would file for
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
due process and as part of that maybe
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
mediation which is what this bill is
 
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:39.890 align:start position:0%
mediation which is what this bill is
about

01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:40.850 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
but the if the parent didn't respond to
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
that or didn't want to do it they would
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
never even go to mediation right the
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
mediation is an agreed upon thing that
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
both sides agree to and I believe the
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill is that sometimes
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
it takes longer than the 30 days to go
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
through the mediation process and if
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
you're on a good run between your the
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
district and the parent and you're
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
getting somewhere and it's the 31st day
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
the bill wants to give you more time to
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
resolve it that way so that you're not
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to a due process hearing
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my confused
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
question so if a parent is not
 
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.550 align:start position:0%
question so if a parent is not
responsive

01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
um that means they're already in the
 
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
process because you created the IEP and
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't signed him brought back all
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
right because they're already in it
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
that'd be a non-responsive parent a
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
responsive parent or would not I'm not
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
responsive parent wouldn't be in this
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
category because they're refusing that
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
is their response so they'd be out of
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
the IEP process at that point not not uh
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
omitting your the next year the teacher
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
wants it done puts in but that's that's
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
a whole different issue yeah thank you
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the question to representative
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
cascadden's Point earlier if the child
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
is in the already in the special
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
education umbrella under that umbrella
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
and there's things the parent doesn't
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
want or wants there's a process for them
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
to refuse those services and document it
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
and that would meet the district's
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
obligation to document that they've
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
offered and the parent doesn't want it
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
and it's documented and you would just
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
go on without worrying about that
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
I kind of equate this to what we just
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
finished doing with the first bill we
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
exec today
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
um we were not there when we did it the
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
first time and we needed to schedule
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
some technical advice and that
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes will happen in in
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
disputes which you see you might want a
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
doctor to come down that doctor might
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
not be able to come one week or two
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
weeks what three weeks from now but if
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
you want to make the best decision on
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of that child and family you go
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
ahead and you try to extend this would
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
allow us to do that and get the
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr just to
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
just to fully clarify because if I
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly then it may not
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
be necessary but I want to be 100. so if
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
a parent it goes through the process
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
early on before this happens before this
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
would happen and goes to the process of
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
refusing IEP signs whatever paperwork is
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
necessary does that then there is no way
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
in which the local Education Agency can
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
file for alternative dispute resolution
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
against the parent to try to get that
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
IEP and then potentially extend that
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
conversation with the parent beyond that
 
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
30-day timeline to ask them to continue
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I'll say what I often used to say to
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
students always and never very maybe
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't ever say always and never there's
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
probably always a circumstance somewhere
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
hidden that would be you know not
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
predictable if a parent has refused
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
services or refused an IEP and they have
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
documented that and the district has
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
that in writing and they've gone down
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
the appropriate process to document all
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
of those things then no the district
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
would not pursue any kind of mediation
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
because what would you be mediating you
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
just the parent said no and that's the
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
end of it
 
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
we had a situation in school I had where
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
we were in a dispute resolution
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
situation and the child did have an IEP
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
the parent wanted that IEP parent wanted
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
more from the IEP than we could deliver
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted a total neurological
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
examination done up at Humana and
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
Anchorage and we were down 365 miles
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
down in Homer Alaska we had a hospital
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
right there we had the neurologist right
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
there and but it had to be the one in
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
Anchorage well you know we said no it's
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be that it's going to be
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
the person we have right here in town
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
and so that's what oftentimes the only
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
times I've been in this is for that were
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
you trying to figure out
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
get to the service you want to provide
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
to the student that students already has
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
an IEP
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
well I've been in Lea to sign off on all
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
of these special ed processes and
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is the duty I mean we're dealing with
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
children there is no right there's no
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
wrong it's not clean cut black white
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
every child is different every parent is
 
01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.109 align:start position:0%
every child is different every parent is
different

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
and the school is responsible as
 
01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:13.629 align:start position:0%
and the school is responsible as
educators

01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:13.639 align:start position:0%
educators
 
01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:17.780 align:start position:0%
to offer and work with a parent to the
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
ninth degree a parent is not always
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
receptive to the IEP process okay but
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
you're responsible to say what we think
 
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
we offer we have this we think this will
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
help that student growth parent
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
disagrees all right well if you need
 
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
some time to think about it
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
you have a right to refuse services
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
and if you want to think about it and
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
then explore yourself or don't agree
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
with an evaluation you have the right to
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
have your own evaluation maybe it proves
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
us wrong that's an option too
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
but this sentence
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
pegs the school against the parent in
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
his language that puts the parent in
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
complete Authority and you know what
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
because they participate if they're good
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
parents in their child's education
 
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
another option they may go back and say
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
gee I heard at that private school my
 
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
child can get a classroom of five or six
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
students because they're over stimulated
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
in your public environment well then
 
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
come back in we'll meet the team if
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a better placement
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
because goals and objectives placement
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
two different things
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
then let's talk and let's go visit that
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
site and talk to that school and see if
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's a better fit for that child to
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
meet their needs
 
01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:45.179 align:start position:0%
and then the school pays tuition if in
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
fact it agrees that that's
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
the model
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
but you can't just forget about it
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
you've got a kid out there that probably
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
has significant learning disabilities or
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
and a parent can choose not to get any
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
help whatsoever the school must then
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
make accommodations to continue to
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
provide what they can for that child
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
under the parents supervision or
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
agreeing the parent might agree to an
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
accommodation rather instead of a
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
separate program they might agree to an
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual Aid within the regular
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
classroom versus having the child this
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
is a common one parents often don't want
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
their child to leave the regular Ed
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
classroom but they need to to get a
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
specialized say the Wilson Reading
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
Program because they're so they're
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
having difficulties
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
so if the parent disagrees with the
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
child leaving the regular classroom
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the district will offer
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
provide an aid so that they can
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate within the classroom so
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
there's a number there's no one
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
situation that's going to fit for all
 
01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
kids they're all individual but as a
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
public school and an educator
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
we have to show good faith effort to do
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to check to educate that
 
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.030 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to check to educate that
child

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
in any way possible but we cannot do it
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%

representative McDonald's would you like
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
to speak to your emotion yes this bill
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
would extend a process in existence that
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
would allow associate degree nurses if
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of completing a
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree to continue their work
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
in schools this is critical to
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
addressing a worker's shortage and like
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
I said this program has been in
 
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:37.820 align:start position:0%
existence so this would be to renew this
 
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
availability this option I'd like to
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
take a second to thank all nurses who
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
are practicing a New Hampshire including
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
my mother and also all those that came
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill School nurses in
 
01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
particular especially those who came
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
from the Salem and the surrounding area
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
was your mother listening to this stream
 
01:51:06.649 --> 01:51:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
rep Santana do you have anything to add
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I would just say that this is a
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
compromise bill that I think really
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
addresses the problems that we've had
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that I would definitely second that
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
School nurses in particular have done a
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeoman's job and
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%

01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
they've done through all the years but
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%

01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%

representative

01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment would you please
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
present your amendment I will uh this
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
amendment strictly just changes the
 
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
effective date and the effective date is
 
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
upon passage we heard there were two
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
problems one with the current nurses
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
with their six-year window is going to
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
close so that's immediate problematic
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
could be and then in the fall when
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
they're trying to hire new nurses it
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
allows them to
 
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
um have a a greater pool of applicants
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
so okay so is there a second okay
 
01:52:18.609 --> 01:52:18.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay so further discussion repson Hall
 
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:23.460 align:start position:0%

01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
already okay
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%

01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
that represent Myler yeah
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%

01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.310 align:start position:0%

01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
on you know goes to the floor consent is
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
there a way where we can um expedite
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
this through the enrolled bills process
 
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:47.940 align:start position:0%

Aladdin second by represent uh uh miler
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to speak to the motion uh I
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
believe and always have that the issue
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
of civics education is drastically
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
needed in this state in this country and
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
from talking and hearing from those that
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
propose this bill for the Professionals
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the field that are recommending that
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
we uh require uh Civics taught as it's
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
recommended in the elementary school by
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
integrating this program into these
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
areas where it can be integrated or
 
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.430 align:start position:0%
areas where it can be integrated or
embedded

01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
embedded
 
01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
um I think that's excellent and we can
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
start right off in the kindergarten
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
where everything you need to know is
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
taught in the kindergarten so we make
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure we hit the kindergarten and getting
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
up into the middle school years as well
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh with the program as it spells that
 
01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.750 align:start position:0%
uh with the program as it spells that
out

01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
get my Amendment or the bill right here
 
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and again uh into the high school
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
where this required one half year of
 
01:56:53.159 --> 01:56:54.350 align:start position:0%
where this required one half year of
civics

01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
civics
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh and that that instruction is very
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
very important as a requirement for
 
01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:01.669 align:start position:0%
very important as a requirement for
graduation

01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
um all this is necessary as well as and
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to negate as Senator Carson
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
had mentioned we asked her when she
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill what about those
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
other subjects like government and
 
01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:15.659 align:start position:0%
history which and they are also we're
 
01:57:17.689 --> 01:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
not trying to you know do away with that
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
in fact we're trying to maintain what
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
we're doing there uh so I I think this
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
is a good step forward Civics is has to
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
be uh emphasized in our schools more
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
just for a Civic society that we can
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much uh a split Society
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
right now and it's time to be able to
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
listen to each other and work together
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
and try to come to closure and if we can
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
teach this in the schools and teach our
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
Democratic process I I think we're going
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
to be successful and come out of this
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
Tunnel able to speak with each other and
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
have a society that respects our
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution and respects all that
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
stands for
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Miler uh thank you uh Mr
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
chair I mean historically
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
I've taken the position personally that
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
this committee should not be demanding
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
local curriculum that should be up to
 
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:12.649 align:start position:0%
local curriculum that should be up to
the

01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
up the local school district to do this
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
I take exception to that historic
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
position on this issue
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
I take exception to it because I think
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
the bill has developed is very
 
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.169 align:start position:0%
the bill has developed is very
comprehensive

01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I want to reiterate a point that
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd mentioned I'm very
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about the disability
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
in our uh
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
culture at this point in time
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the inability for people to come
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
together and to talk
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
and to share ideas and
 
01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:50.780 align:start position:0%
try to dissuade people in a civil manner
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
respective positions
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
I think that this does provide an
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide to heighten the
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
of the need to create a civil society
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes beyond content it goes be it
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
really is about people coming together
 
01:59:11.570 --> 01:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
and be able to talk with one another uh
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
in a in a way that is not uh
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
antagonistic I mean we've often said you
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
know we can we can disagree but we don't
 
01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
have to be disagreeable
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what I'm looking
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
forward to and I think by having this uh
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
not just in the high school level but
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
beginning at the elementary level where
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
kids can have a chance to come together
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to problem solve
 
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
I mean that's one of the problems we
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
have now is how do you don't just go to
 
01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
respective corners and come out fighting
 
01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
but how do you come to the center of the
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
ring and be able to say how do we solve
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
these problems that are facing us now
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that this uh this really is
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that and I've got
 
01:59:54.649 --> 01:59:54.659 align:start position:0%
high hopes but that as a result of this
 
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
as those children who started in
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten in first grade in second
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
grade by the time they get to high
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
school and behind they become young
 
02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
adults they will be able to change
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
what's happening right now in this
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
country which I am very disappointed in
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I totally support this thank you Mr
 
02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:15.129 align:start position:0%
so I totally support this thank you Mr
chair

02:00:15.129 --> 02:00:15.139 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I I respect and
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
admire the comments of both of you on
 
02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:22.940 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
just a a question uh in this committee
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
we generally come out against
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
high-stakes testing
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
as as a requirement for leaving a
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
program just I will make the point that
 
02:00:41.209 --> 02:00:41.219 align:start position:0%
we now have added another high stakes
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
test writing it on top of this so that
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
at this point there are two tests that
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
you have to pass in order to do this uh
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
one will be the locally produced
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
assessment test that each School
 
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
District bus through and we are still
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
stuck with the naturalization test and I
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
would leave it up to you to decide which
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to also hand the gavel
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment 1394 which is an amendment
 
02:01:25.089 --> 02:01:25.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
and okay okay I'll take it back second
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
okay okay so now we have a a Amendment
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
two two one six it is 11394 and I'd like
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to that now
 
02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.169 align:start position:0%
to speak to that now
um

02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to reflect a little bit on
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
what I saw yesterday when we had 130
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
pink slips handed into us and I saw a
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
hearing which was conducted in a way
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
that there are many Divergent positions
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
presented and we did it in a manner in
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
which I think we got through that
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
everybody had an equal opportunity to
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
present their position people listened
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is all about and
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
this is what Civics is now what I've
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
done in this amendment that you have in
 
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
front of you I've also looked at Roman
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
numeral one which is in this bill which
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
is language that's currently there but
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
part of that has been struck the part
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
that was struck says such instruction
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
shall not later than the beginning of
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
the eighth grade and shall continue in
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
all high schools is a component of what
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
one credit course of instruction
 
02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
required for high school graduation in
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
the United States and New Hampshire
 
02:02:39.179 --> 02:02:40.430 align:start position:0%
the United States and New Hampshire
history

02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
and a one-half credit course of
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
instruction and it goes on in the United
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
States government New Hampshire
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
government and Civics this bill is is
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
integrating into our statutes Civics
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
education and the bill that the
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm proposing does nothing to
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
change anything in the bill as it came
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
to us from the Senate
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
what it does do it adds one component in
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
there which reflects back in Roman one
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
here and it's listed as One D here a
 
02:03:15.169 --> 02:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
one-year course of instruction in
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
history government and constitutions
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
United States and New Hampshire in high
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
school required for high school
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
graduation that's spoken to enrollment
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
one right now but we struck out the part
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
which talks about that one year course I
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose that I do not want to
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
see any part of the social studies
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum being at history our
 
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
government our civics
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
left out
 
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
and it's all important and I'm not
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
trying to negate Civics I I'm 100 behind
 
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
that but what this does it's put it puts
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
back in that one small component excuse
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
me and on one C down below uh in the the
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was presented to us
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
is spoke to
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
a school district shall develop an offer
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
the United States New Hampshire
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
government course under paragraph one
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
and Civics course under paragraph 1A
 
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's how it's written down this will
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
simply say a school district shall
 
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
develop an office the United States and
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire history government and
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
constitutions course and Civics course
 
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
courses under paragraph 1A
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh so it offers both of these courses
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
but it also mentions the components
 
02:04:35.689 --> 02:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
which are in the first line of Roman one
 
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
which were not negated
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so this puts them back in the bill
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
so it means we're going to do the whole
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
nine yards here rather than ensuring
 
02:04:47.570 --> 02:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
that we do a component a new component
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
the half year course in Civics at the
 
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
high school level we're also going to
 
02:04:55.129 --> 02:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
have to have that year requirement in
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
the history and the government of our
 
02:04:59.330 --> 02:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
country as well and of our state
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
so that's nothing new it's just just
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying in in the so I won't speak
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
any more to that
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
um are there other discussion on the
 
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:09.950 align:start position:0%
um are there other discussion on the
amendment

02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
but you did second it I understand that
 
02:05:12.179 --> 02:05:14.930 align:start position:0%
but you did second it I understand that
Mel

02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you represent cascadden
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
I just want to add to what
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Miler said um I really
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
oppose curriculum that's driven from the
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
legislature versus from local control or
 
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
from the field
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
um but this bill is different I know
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
that this comes from work done by social
 
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
studies teachers and that's different to
 
02:05:43.729 --> 02:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
me than something that's done from a
 
02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
legislative body that doesn't have the
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
experience it doesn't walk the walk uh
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little appalled it has to come
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
to that point
 
02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:57.659 align:start position:0%
because my perception would be if it has
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
to be a law it's because somebody's not
 
02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:03.179 align:start position:0%
doing it and they need to do it so I
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know I I'd like to just respond to
 
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
that a little bit and then represent
 
02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:14.209 align:start position:0%
that a little bit and then represent
McDonald

02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
McDonald
 
02:06:14.219 --> 02:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
McDonald
um

02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
I was a social studies teacher I was an
 
02:06:19.070 --> 02:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher I wrote the main
 
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum project for the state
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
of Maine as New Hampshire and it had a
 
02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
component of all these subject core
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
areas we also had in Title 20 in the
 
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
state of Maine it was also part of our
 
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
statutory language there are some states
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
which do write social studies
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
goals you might say into statute we've
 
02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
sort of done that here uh to a degree we
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
put some major themes in there but we're
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
not I think it'd be wrong for us to get
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
down and say okay we're going to load it
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
up with a lot of this this this this and
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
this that is where the professional
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
field comes into play and that's where I
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
as a teacher came into play too and and
 
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I I've met a lot of our teachers that
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
are teaching social studies in fact we
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
have a fantastic social studies teacher
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
up in Woodsville he does military
 
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
history he does civics and he makes it
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
come alive and it talks about some of
 
02:07:16.609 --> 02:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
the skills that are in this Civics
 
02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
component right here where it teaches
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
people how to analyze and strategize and
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
to use the rhetoric that we were the
 
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
thinking skills that we've just recently
 
02:07:30.010 --> 02:07:30.020 align:start position:0%
put into our adequacy
 
02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
a statute so so that along with coupled
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
um the the communication skills or
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me the logic was we put in the
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
rhetoric is the communication with those
 
02:07:44.689 --> 02:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
two I think this matches up very closely
 
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
to rhetoric and and logic and uh so I'm
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
all for this
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's needed and I think
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
it also gives our social studies
 
02:07:56.689 --> 02:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
teachers out in the field the strength
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
and the backup that they need right now
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
social studies unfortunately I believe
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's been put in the back seat since we
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
no longer
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
um uh address it the same way we do
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
reading right an arithmetic
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
furthest discussion represent McDonald
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I just wanted to
 
02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
add on and respond to what you said
 
02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you this Civics
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
instruction has not been taught or at
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
least to the extent that it should and
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
it should be taught in speaking to your
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
point Mr chairman I would agree with
 
02:08:29.810 --> 02:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
that as well that it's not necessarily
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
the fault of our teachers because they
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
have other priorities in focusing on the
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
stem courses or science or math reading
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
and writing so in this bill the intent
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
is to put more time on Civics and just
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
emphasis for this and I think you
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
covered what I was going to say but it's
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
really to support the backbone of our
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
social studies teachers and it's
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
necessary at this time so
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden and
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
representative Damon just wanted to add
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the issue of the naturalization test
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's being given last Friday I had a
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
group from my high school for
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
representing Youth and government and we
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
had conversations about what the kids
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
were doing and whatnot
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
but the teachers were very anxious to
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
say to me
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
but we're getting ready to give that
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
immigration test and we need to get rid
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
of that we'd rather do our own
 
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
and know where the kids stand versus
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
taking that because of the time factor
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it takes and it's another thing so
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Ellison to
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
really kind of look at that at some
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
point to repeal it thanks represent
 
02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.950 align:start position:0%
point to repeal it thanks represent
Damon

02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to remind everybody in
 
02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
case with the large number of emails
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
we've all been receiving that we did
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
receive a follow-up email from Janet
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
Ward who has been involved with the New
 
02:09:52.689 --> 02:09:52.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics Coalition
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
reminding us that they will provide a
 
02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
variety of curricular materials at no
 
02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.570 align:start position:0%
variety of curricular materials at no
cost

02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
for all the grade levels to any District
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
that wants to access them so there's no
 
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
added cost to obtain materials for this
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
that is one option anyway
 
02:10:12.649 --> 02:10:12.659 align:start position:0%
um and I want to just say that it is
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
such a pleasure to talk about Civics as
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan need and topic with this
 
02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.970 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan need and topic with this
group

the intent here though rep Cornelia is
 
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
not here today is to make minor
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
modifications that
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that do truly
 
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um reflect the the bipartisan interest

um and the introduction of this bill
 
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
and I think the language that you will
 
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
find in this along with the values that
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
it recommends to be implicated including
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
honor humility Integrity contribution
 
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:54.420 align:start position:0%

um 1A it retains the same list but it
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
changes the the language and the
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
specific requirements within the list
 
02:13:56.089 --> 02:13:56.099 align:start position:0%
for what is taught within the Civics
 
02:13:56.099 --> 02:13:58.189 align:start position:0%
for what is taught within the Civics
education

02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
and what lines are that is that on that
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
would be page one lines
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.619 --> 02:14:19.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:19.450 --> 02:14:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
basically defines what Civics means
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes it defines what Civics means
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
within that within that section as well
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
I think that's the biggie is that where
 
02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
it breaks it out
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically just giving a
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
definition of what Civics means in
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.169 --> 02:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
okay and and this one right here you
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's it does not include
 
02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
non-public and private Incorporated
 
02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.129 align:start position:0%
non-public and private Incorporated
schools

02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
that Service public schools in the state
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.290 --> 02:15:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
and up in Roman 1 we speak specifically
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
to public and non-public
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah in Roman one it has public and
 
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
non-public yeah with the original bills
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's possible that in the private school
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
the non-public schools that is left more
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the non-public schools to determine
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
when and how they're going to do it but
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the public schools since that's what
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
we have oversight over
 
02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
as this body we are saying
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um these are the things or this is
 
02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
you're going to make sure that you do it
 
02:15:46.729 --> 02:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
in elementary school middle school and
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
okay this is from rep cordelli
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
um this amendment does four things one
 
02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
it maintains in section one that all
 
02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
public and non-public schools in the
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
state there shall be given regular
 
02:16:11.410 --> 02:16:11.420 align:start position:0%
courses of instruction and history
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
government and constitutions of the
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
United States and New Hampshire
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
it removes however all the requirements
 
02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
for course requirements in grade levels
 
02:16:24.589 --> 02:16:24.599 align:start position:0%
and Civics components for non-public
 
02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
schools in
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one ABC it also removes
 
02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
the Civics test graduation requirement
 
02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:36.599 align:start position:0%
for non-public schools in Roman numeral
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
two on page two
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that the state should
 
02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
be imposing those criteria on non-public
 
02:16:43.139 --> 02:16:45.049 align:start position:0%
be imposing those criteria on non-public
schools

02:16:45.049 --> 02:16:45.059 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
number two it modifies Roman numeral 1B
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
Civics program comments it changes C to
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
specify freedom of speech and religion
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
number three it adds a component of
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
civics virtues as D the inclusion of
 
02:17:05.209 --> 02:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
Virtues as a primary education comment
 
02:17:08.410 --> 02:17:08.420 align:start position:0%
goes back to Aristotle
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
our Constitution Article 38 says a
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
frequent recurrence to the fundamental
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
principles of the Constitution and a
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
constant adherence to Justice moderation
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
Temperance industry frugality and all
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
the social virtues are indispensably
 
02:17:28.969 --> 02:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
necessary to preserve the blessing
 
02:17:31.549 --> 02:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
of Liberty and good government
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
a 2021 report titled educating for an
 
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
American democracy included this
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
challenges facing constitutional
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
democracy in the United States and the
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
need to set high expectations for the
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge skills and Civic virtues of
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
American citizens this report was led by
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the organization I Civics founded by
 
02:17:57.770 --> 02:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
a report from the Bill of Rights
 
02:18:02.810 --> 02:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
Institute stated Founders counted on
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
citizens to live out virtues like
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
justice honesty respect humility and
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility I believe to leave virtue
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
out of civics would be to leave out what
 
02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
our constitution says is a fundamental
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
principle and certainly was considered
 
02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
by our founders
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
and number four
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
adds a new section 2 on the last page it
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
adds Federal Constitution Day September
 
02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:32.700 align:start position:0%

02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
state to ratify it
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
these facts should be a source of honor
 
02:20:21.050 --> 02:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
and pride to every New Hampshire citizen
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is fitting and proper that New
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%

I will conclude by quoting from a 2010

all New Hampshire Public School students
 
02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
should study Civics starting in
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and continue the study of
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
civics through the 12th grade by the
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
time they graduate from high school
 
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
students should have gained the basic
 
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge experience and inspiration
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
they will need to engage meaningfully in
 
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Civic lives of their communities
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
their state and their Nation I ask you
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
consider my Amendment but I ask you to
 
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:35.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative

thank you chairman
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I have difficulty with this amendment
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
for a host of reasons the first is one
 
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the things we just talked about a
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
minute ago how fortunate we were that we
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
weren't hamstring local school committee
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
Local School departments with the
 
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
individual chapter reverse of what
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to put into their
 
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
curriculum we're allowing the local
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
school to do that and this is totally
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
obvious of that I'm not particularly
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
excited about we probably passed the
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
building includes all schools in New
 
02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we take out non-republican
 
02:22:06.370 --> 02:22:06.380 align:start position:0%
private school
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and thoroughly uh
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
the section two at the end really seems
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't I don't understand it as
 
02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
also a socialite teacher chairman that
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
at one point how we teach these these
 
02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:25.340 align:start position:0%
virtues uh uh in a bypass away line 33
 
02:22:28.250 --> 02:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's just it's really putting
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
teachers in difficult spaces uh and then
 
02:22:33.410 --> 02:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
to conclude numbers at the end so I'll
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
make this one comment uh prior to at the
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
end of Page Three uh it's telling you
 
02:22:41.929 --> 02:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
exactly what we have to discuss the
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
history of the pleasure leads and what
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
they mean what the pledge allegiance to
 
02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
me or the Star Spangled Banner means as
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
individual content areas and then tell
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
them how they're going to prescribe
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
these patriotic exercises
 
02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.790 align:start position:0%
these patriotic exercises
laughs

02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.929 --> 02:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
as a veteran
 
02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
and as a social studies teacher I don't
 
02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
agree with this thank you
 
02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
represent Miler yeah I would I would
 
02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
concur with uh representative Woodcock I
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
believe this is a bit prescriptive and
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
we've we have a bill before us right now
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
and that has been worked uh through a
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
number of different uh entities
 
02:23:26.809 --> 02:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
including uh teachers Etc and the Civics
 
02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
organization within the organ within the
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
state and I I just believe that this
 
02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
goes a bit too far uh and and would
 
02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Woodcock so I
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
I will be voting no on this amendment
 
02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:43.500 align:start position:0%

those remarks because I think they were
 
02:23:54.290 --> 02:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful and and in particular
 
02:23:56.809 --> 02:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
the uh the concluding remarks that say
 
02:23:59.690 --> 02:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment but pass the bill
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%

Madsen for um uh for leading this um
 
02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
this effort this bipartisan effort uh I
 
02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:18.500 align:start position:0%
know it's included a whole lot of people
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh like uh like former Congress uh
 
02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
congressman and um and chief justice
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
Chuck Douglas
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
um was also the um the um uh I think
 
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
attorney for the for for our uh uh New
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives four
 
02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
years ago and uh and I think that
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group has really taken on an
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
incredible uh role to to lead us in a
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan way of providing Civics and
 
02:24:51.469 --> 02:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
instruction throughout the state and um
 
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
and you know we we talked about I think
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
a couple days ago how how the New
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house comes up with thousands
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
of great ideas every year and uh and I'm
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
sure we'll continue to to do that but as
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
it relates to Civics instruction I think
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
it would be tremendously valuable to uh
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
to vet those ideas through New Hampshire
 
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
Civics through through
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
um um um Ms madsen's uh organization and
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and leverage their expertise
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
their nonpartisan expertise in this area
 
02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the benefit of all our
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
kids so so thank you guys very much
 
02:25:33.170 --> 02:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative yeah
 
02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
the comment and a question uh the
 
02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:39.020 align:start position:0%
comment is
 
02:25:41.929 --> 02:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
understanding of Civic virtues including
 
02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
I would hope that all of our Civics
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
teachers could do that given that my
 
02:25:50.889 --> 02:25:50.899 align:start position:0%
band teacher in grades three through six
 
02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
instilled these ideas in all of us kids
 
02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
at school I would hope a Civics
 
02:25:59.410 --> 02:25:59.420 align:start position:0%
instructor would not have an issue with
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
helping us understand the Civic Virtues
 
02:26:04.610 --> 02:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
Of Honor humility Integrity contribution
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
and responsibility
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's my comment my question though is
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
with regards to all of the things that
 
02:26:16.849 --> 02:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
were mentioned in paragraph 1C
 
02:26:16.859 --> 02:26:19.070 align:start position:0%
were mentioned in paragraph 1C
I

02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
I is this not already in law except for
 
02:26:25.849 --> 02:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
the addition of Declaration of
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
Independence and then down further it
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
says this section instead of paragraph
 
02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
says this section instead of paragraph
one

02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
and public school or chartered public
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
school added in I mean I thought just
 
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
the bolds were the added things and the
 
02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
rest of it was already in the law so
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's my question is that am I mistaken
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.969 --> 02:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
I was I taught Civics also and you know
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
I I think that some of these uh
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
um items which are mentioned by uh
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli honor humility
 
02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli honor humility
Etc

02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
of course I recall duty honor and
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
Country when I served and I think that
 
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
that is covered already in the uh the
 
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill when you talk about Civic life and
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
how life and the individual may be
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
involved in Civic life I think these are
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
basic understandings and I think what
 
02:27:32.929 --> 02:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
we're doing by starting to you know
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
those terms which are identifying the
 
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
these these virtues
 
02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of like the Boy Scouts
 
02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
Creed Duty you know all that I can
 
02:27:47.450 --> 02:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
remember having to memorize all that
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
stuff as a kid and that that's just when
 
02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
we get down into that business we are
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
getting down into what a Civics teacher
 
02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.050 align:start position:0%
getting down into what a Civics teacher
is

02:27:57.050 --> 02:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
takes that Praxis for and takes those
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
courses for it comes to school prepared
 
02:28:03.969 --> 02:28:03.979 align:start position:0%
that's what I expect
 
02:28:07.849 --> 02:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
the these will be integrated into you
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
know humility yeah you're gonna you're
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
gonna incorporate that into your
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
everything you do in school
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
um responsibility yeah you get your
 
02:28:16.849 --> 02:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
homework in on time
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and just all those I I think when we
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
start starting to make a laundry list
 
02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
there's always something on the laundry
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
list you leave out
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and we've experienced that in
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
statute so many times I'm getting to the
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
point where you know I I kind of learned
 
02:28:35.809 --> 02:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
something the other day too when I came
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
in with an amendment on Friday and I
 
02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
said well we need to put in the
 
02:28:40.849 --> 02:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
Constitution first constitution in
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
America the constitution of New
 
02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well we start making this
 
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
laundry list and and we got sort of a
 
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
little laundry list in there as this
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
right now which the Senate put in there
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
but uh I I I I I don't know if it's
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
really even necessary to do that
 
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
um so I think we can't get too
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and this is getting very
 
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
prescriptive uh so I I I'm gonna have a
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
hard time voting for this as well
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that I look at the the
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
signatories to this bill I look at the
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
front side there and it's pretty evenly
 
02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
split between Senators that are
 
02:29:20.809 --> 02:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
Republican Senators that are Democrat in
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
there and there's a hefty load of them
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
there in fact this is all Senators that
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill
 
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
I want to turn around and say to them
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
you guys got it right this time it's the
 
02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
you know this time uh so
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm gonna just try to leave the
 
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
bill as much as possible to the way
 
02:29:43.370 --> 02:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
we've done it and the deal with the
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment which just tried to take part
 
02:29:47.929 --> 02:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
of Roman one and put it down below uh so
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm good the way we we have it
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
presented to us I'm not really
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
interested in in furthering this at this
 
02:29:55.859 --> 02:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
interested in in furthering this at this
time

02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:29:59.450 --> 02:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman I
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
said I wasn't going to say anymore but
 
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
we just just got to some of it today and
 
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
I see and this this is the part that I I
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
find disturbing when we get three pages
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
of amendment the final four on it uh to
 
02:30:13.969 --> 02:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
get all the little pieces off add it in
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
quietly in my opinion on line 26 what is
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
the edition of page one of the cordelian
 
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
moment is the addition of and religion
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
it was no and religion in the original
 
02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:28.010 align:start position:0%
it was no and religion in the original
bill

02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
and when you put using historical
 
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
references I mean we went through Garden
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
schools last year
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
and I just think this I think
 
02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think just seeing this go through
 
02:30:40.270 --> 02:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
adding religion into this pot
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to everyone is questionable
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
as well and that's line 26 on the
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
Cordelia moment
 
02:30:48.359 --> 02:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
Cordelia moment
representative

02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
line 23 sorry page two line 23. it says
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
that that's current law that's current
 
02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:21.290 align:start position:0%
that that's current law that's current
law

02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
he's on page one
 
02:31:23.399 --> 02:31:32.750 align:start position:0%
he's on page one
yeah

02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
glorified section D in the original 26
 
02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
no not sorry
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher I think I'd just
 
02:31:49.010 --> 02:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
like to clarify on that particular point
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I think there perhaps could have
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
been worded or perhaps a comma and
 
02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
another word in the right spot I think
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's simply referring to freedom of
 
02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
religion and the importance of freedom
 
02:32:00.349 --> 02:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
of religion which I don't think anybody
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
yeah which again okay any further
 
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
discussion so we have an amendment in
 
02:32:19.090 --> 02:32:19.100 align:start position:0%
front of us right now
 
02:32:23.929 --> 02:32:23.939 align:start position:0%

comments for uh after that particular
 
02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:56.690 align:start position:0%
comments for uh after that particular
Amendment

02:33:56.690 --> 02:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I will first say there is a lot of
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
very much like within the specifics of
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
there are however a few things that I
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
have considerable concerns with
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
um not the least of which being
 
02:34:15.050 --> 02:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
page one lines 23-24 the acquisition of
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
skills such as the ability to analyze
 
02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
text in the term the reliability and
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
biases of sources now under normal
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances that may not seem very
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
objectionable but I think we need to be
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
honest with ourselves that our Civic
 
02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
institutions as they currently stand
 
02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps are not healthy enough nor is
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
our body politic in agreement enough to
 
02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
be handing over the teaching of what is
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
or is not biased material
 
02:34:45.050 --> 02:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
um outside of the home
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
that is one considerable problem I have
 
02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
because that's going to run up against a
 
02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
lot of ideological problems and it's
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to cause issues the second
 
02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.429 align:start position:0%
going to cause issues the second
significant

02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
um issue that I that I see here is not
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill itself but
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
it is something that's enabled by the
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
language of the bill we heard testimony
 
02:35:07.130 --> 02:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and we've heard that there's going to
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
be curriculum provided for free
 
02:35:11.929 --> 02:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
uh to fill these Civic requirements now
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
we are expanding the Civics education
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill and we're hearing that
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
this curriculum is going to be provided
 
02:35:19.849 --> 02:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
I did quite a bit of research on this
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum and I have to be honest this
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum is anything but nonpartisan
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
and non-biased
 
02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
this curriculum makes assumptions
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
such as this country is a progressive
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy with a living document
 
02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
Constitution that is to be reinterpreted
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
according to the times
 
02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
both of those are debatable matters and
 
02:35:46.610 --> 02:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
political matters I would I would take
 
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
issue with both those personally I think
 
02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
the proper way to interpret the
 
02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution lies somewhere between
 
02:35:53.929 --> 02:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
originalism and textualism not a living
 
02:35:53.939 --> 02:35:55.130 align:start position:0%
originalism and textualism not a living
document

02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
so this we're running up against issues
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
here that were we know we're going to be
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
instituting a certain curriculum
 
02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
and through this research I've
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
discovered this curriculum
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
is is not nonpartisan and the only thing
 
02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
worse than being Not educated is being
 
02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
miseducated and I want to see students
 
02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
educated properly and I think a real
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort that at this would
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
have to remove those biases from this
 
02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:26.110 align:start position:0%
have to remove those biases from this
program

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
bye

02:36:33.170 --> 02:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
bye
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Miler yeah you know
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
we can look at alternative uh realities
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
all we want to
 
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
but this program was developed through a
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan approach you've heard who's
 
02:36:48.170 --> 02:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
been involved in this thing
 
02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
and you've got people from the right
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
people from the left who came together
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to create this
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm not about to sit here and try to
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
create an alternative Universe here
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I think what has been created
 
02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
here is an approach
 
02:37:04.849 --> 02:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
that is in fact bipartisan whether you
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
like it or not
 
02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:07.550 align:start position:0%
like it or not
and

02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to move forward with
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
this and it's about time that we provide
 
02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:14.030 align:start position:0%
this and it's about time that we provide
uh

02:37:14.030 --> 02:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
students from early elementary through
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
High School an opportunity to really
 
02:37:23.690 --> 02:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
begin to hear the various viewpoints
 
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
around how this country was formed and
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
how Civility and Civics should be
 
02:37:32.929 --> 02:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll make one last comment yeah I
 
02:37:38.270 --> 02:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
like everybody look at the bill on page
 
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
one uh not page one but on the first
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
page where it says Senate Bill 216 and
 
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.660 --> 02:37:50.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:37:50.170 --> 02:37:50.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
ERS are truly
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan split you know of the
 
02:37:59.929 --> 02:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.809 --> 02:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
they're all supporting this bill
 
02:38:02.819 --> 02:38:05.270 align:start position:0%
they're all supporting this bill
unanimously

02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I I cannot understand why then that
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be looking at it the same
 
02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
way knowing where it's come from the
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
work that's gone into it and there is
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's even places in this law book
 
02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
here where the Constitution has to be
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
provided to schools for instruction we
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
have that in there in the statute
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh so I I I I I think that Civics
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
instruction is going to be taught by you
 
02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
know as a principal I'd look for the
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
best Civics teacher I could find
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
and when I did the interviewing process
 
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
I would ask them to explain
 
02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
some things about Civics just like I
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
used to say to teachers coming in want
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
to teach elementary Reading well I'm a
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
great reading teacher well tell me a
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
couple thematic reading books that you
 
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
use in your classroom some that said
 
02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
they were great readers couldn't tell me
 
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
one title
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
and so you know that was easy to Wade
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
through that so uh you know I think uh
 
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
what's taught in schools
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
is a result of top down that your
 
02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
supervision your school your principals
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
in a school your school board the one
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
the set the tone and and uh right now
 
02:39:15.469 --> 02:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
that to say that we're going to let the
 
02:39:18.050 --> 02:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
the teacher in the classroom Wag the Dog
 
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's like that
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
you know I was in the classroom
 
02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
observing the non-tenure teachers three
 
02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
evaluations every year three
 
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
observations for each evaluation and
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
then when we got to the other part when
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
they were then tenure teachers
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
same deal not as often and we had some
 
02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
kinds of different plans where a teacher
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
could work with other teachers and doing
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
the valuation there's a lot of different
 
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
ways of doing it and so you know I I
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
have to have faith in in the folks which
 
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
are are teaching yes everything's not
 
02:39:54.170 --> 02:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
the way I'd like to see it and if
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reasons why it's not
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of it's our fault because we have
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
so many rules and regulations and we're
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
telling everybody how to do things and
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
we are putting more on the plate than
 
02:40:07.010 --> 02:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
the plate can hold so I for one am going
 
02:40:09.889 --> 02:40:09.899 align:start position:0%
to very much support this bill
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
the way it's been presented and the way
 
02:40:14.690 --> 02:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
we've amended it thank you
 
02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:16.250 align:start position:0%

pattern now
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
Noble Gray Court yellow for the work you
 
02:41:35.090 --> 02:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
did yesterday
 
02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
I mean this was this was a very
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
difficult hearing some of you have not
 
02:41:42.889 --> 02:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
had the experience of being in front of
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
a crowd that's passionate on both of
 
02:41:49.370 --> 02:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
their sides and I just think I think it
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
was conductive I was just proud of this
 
02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
committee and the way it was done and
 
02:41:56.090 --> 02:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
and David and I were talking on the way
 
02:41:59.330 --> 02:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
home this piece was something new that
 
02:42:01.610 --> 02:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
never happened before and so when you
 
02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
when you said at begin no no clapping or
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
anything when this began to go like this
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
I thought that was kind of cool because
 
02:42:12.290 --> 02:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
it didn't break it didn't break the
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
protocol but it allowed people to kind
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
of say where they were on those issues
 
02:42:19.130 --> 02:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
and my sense is that we may have started
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
a new new tradition uh in in that when
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
their hearings in that house but but I I
 
02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
I just think you guys did a great job
 
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate the leadership
 
02:42:31.370 --> 02:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
that you all provide thank you very much
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and we
 
02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
learned another thing at that when you
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
hand the pink card in the eye ideas to
 
02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
hand the pink card in the eye ideas to
communicate

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
and when it's scribbled in such a way
 
02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:43.370 align:start position:0%
and when it's scribbled in such a way
that

02:42:43.370 --> 02:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
Katie and I are over there trying to
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%

02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:52.880 --> 03:34:55.210 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:34:55.210 --> 03:34:55.220 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:35:01.969 --> 03:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.889 --> 03:35:05.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I had a pencil Mark there too
 
03:35:12.650 --> 03:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
and so we'll start on the top of page 26
 
03:35:12.660 --> 03:35:15.050 align:start position:0%
and so we'll start on the top of page 26
then

03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.210 --> 03:35:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
I have a stop right in the bottom page
 
03:35:50.580 --> 03:35:53.090 align:start position:0%
I have a stop right in the bottom page
25.

03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
25.
 
03:36:03.410 --> 03:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.210 --> 03:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
so you're increasing from four to five
 
03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:06.349 align:start position:0%
so you're increasing from four to five
years

03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:36:07.849 --> 03:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with the federal law
 
03:36:09.650 --> 03:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
so Essa requires
 
03:36:11.450 --> 03:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
um a revaluation of the plan every five
 
03:36:12.650 --> 03:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
years so if we're going to do it every
 
03:36:13.969 --> 03:36:13.979 align:start position:0%
five years we should do the state and
 
03:36:20.090 --> 03:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
now the legislative oversight committee
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
was there
 
03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:25.670 align:start position:0%
was there
this

03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I and I think this is actually a
 
03:36:29.690 --> 03:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
mistake that the department made so when
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
we first started working on this we were
 
03:36:33.050 --> 03:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
using an older version of the law that
 
03:36:34.849 --> 03:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
didn't have the oversight Committee in
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
it so I think we should actually put the
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
oversight committee back in there
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay so that's fine we'll put that back
 
03:36:41.220 --> 03:36:42.290 align:start position:0%
okay so that's fine we'll put that back
there

03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:36:42.300 --> 03:36:45.830 align:start position:0%
there
okay

03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.450 --> 03:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
everybody agreeing to that okay
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
I think the just the oversight committee
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
it's in that responsibility list of the
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
oversight there's no real way to do it
 
03:37:07.610 --> 03:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
to the general court and get any no that
 
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
would take years right and you would
 
03:37:12.769 --> 03:37:12.779 align:start position:0%
never get agreements right so we would
 
03:37:14.330 --> 03:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
prefer to be the oversight committee as
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we didn't really make any changes to
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
these sections at all except some just
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
Clarity and language and whatnot and
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
things like where it says the
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner we had to change it to the
 
03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:37.190 align:start position:0%
commissioner we had to change it to the
Department

03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
Department
 
03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:39.650 align:start position:0%
Department
um

03:37:39.650 --> 03:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
your determination year clarification
 
03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:45.469 align:start position:0%
your determination year clarification
there

03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between a second
 
03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:48.889 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between a second
uh

03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
consecutive determination year versus
 
03:37:54.170 --> 03:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
the second year because we don't do
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
determinations every year so the next
 
03:37:59.210 --> 03:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
year there wouldn't so if somebody were
 
03:38:01.969 --> 03:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
to be identified as a CSI school
 
03:38:04.969 --> 03:38:04.979 align:start position:0%
um today we wouldn't do a determination
 
03:38:07.130 --> 03:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
for three more years so there would be
 
03:38:09.050 --> 03:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
no additional data in that time period
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do a redetermination in the
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
next year so we would need to do
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
determination years and not consecutive
 
03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
same thing consecutive years
 
03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner Department yeah okay
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner designee for that one
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
everybody good with addressing me
 
03:38:46.010 --> 03:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
.

03:38:53.710 --> 03:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.190 --> 03:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is probably not going
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
to be the person that actually presents
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the reports of the State Board of
 
03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
Education it will likely be me or Nate
 
03:39:08.210 --> 03:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
or whoever is in those positions but the
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
person that's doing the technical work
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.490 --> 03:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
the commissioner sells does not would
 
03:39:17.929 --> 03:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
not be there probably the appropriate
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
person to to be presenting on some of
 
03:39:23.290 --> 03:39:23.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.170 --> 03:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
these are the your these are the reports
 
03:39:46.969 --> 03:39:46.979 align:start position:0%
required for schools that fail to
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
provide a radical education by the
 
03:39:51.290 --> 03:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
definitions of either ibass or pfas so
 
03:39:52.969 --> 03:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
there's three years or three consecutive
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
years of reporting versus or termination
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
years of reporting so each year the
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
first year the school has to do a
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
certain plan the next year the school
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
has to do a certain plan
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
03:40:08.929 --> 03:40:08.939 align:start position:0%
um so the commissioner has to provide uh
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
updates right now to the State Board of
 
03:40:14.809 --> 03:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
Education on how how that is going and
 
03:40:16.130 --> 03:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to commissioner or
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
designee that would be providing that
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
information to the State Board
 
03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:25.210 align:start position:0%
information to the State Board
foreign

03:40:25.210 --> 03:40:25.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
that may very well be prepared by by you
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
know you Caitlin and Nate or others but
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
um but if we've got
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
um uh schools that are unable to
 
03:40:39.769 --> 03:40:39.779 align:start position:0%
demonstrate adequacy for three
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
consecutive years I think the
 
03:40:43.190 --> 03:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner should be the one to answer
 
03:40:46.250 --> 03:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
to the state board for that and um and
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know I think some could say that
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
following yesterday uh we need to have a
 
03:40:54.530 --> 03:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner that that does actually
 
03:40:57.769 --> 03:40:57.779 align:start position:0%
understand what the um you know what
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
what the expectations are and what the
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
requirements are for schools to meet
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
um to provide an adequate opportunity
 
03:41:08.450 --> 03:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
for an education so so I get it that you
 
03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
guys will be up there with the
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner but I think it I think it
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
is the commissioner
 
03:41:16.090 --> 03:41:16.100 align:start position:0%
um who's responsible to the state board
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and accountable
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
um you know in this area and and but it
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
could be the Deputy Commissioner why why
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
not right but I think the accountability
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
goes to the commissioner and the
 
03:41:28.439 --> 03:41:29.690 align:start position:0%
goes to the commissioner and the
commissioner

03:41:29.690 --> 03:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:41:31.610 --> 03:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's important that the
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner be versed in in the
 
03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
commissioner be versed in in the
requirements

03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
um to provide an opportunity for an
 
03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
adequate education be able to explain
 
03:41:45.290 --> 03:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
why us why a school hasn't for for three
 
03:41:47.150 --> 03:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
consecutive years and what the
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
department has done to to try to correct
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that situation and be accountable for
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
the failure of the department to let it
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
represent cascaden I'm stretching no I
 
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:42:08.330 --> 03:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
um no it the thought crossed my mind
 
03:42:10.729 --> 03:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
that how else I don't have a problem if
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're the designees because you prepare
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
it you know it you walk it
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
but how would the commissioner know
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
the situation in the nuts and bolts
 
03:42:23.590 --> 03:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to even to converse about it
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't
 
03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:28.979 align:start position:0%
do that last step of the presentation
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
how would he is there another means
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
where he would learn it would he I I
 
03:42:35.690 --> 03:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
don't know what that answer is but to me
 
03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
if he was doing the final presentation
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
along with the team he would at least
 
03:42:41.760 --> 03:42:43.490 align:start position:0%
along with the team he would at least
know

03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:42:46.729 --> 03:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
about those details because as a I don't
 
03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
know my perception is
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
he should know all the nuts and bolts of
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
everything whether he's the one that's
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
presenting or not
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
how would he learn that how would he do
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
that you know what I'm saying and I
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
think representative Luna raised the
 
03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
point that
 
03:43:05.330 --> 03:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
if that's the final step of who the
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
reporting goes to or the accountability
 
03:43:11.929 --> 03:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
and maybe it better be him so he would
 
03:43:14.330 --> 03:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
know it otherwise
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't know it I guess unless
 
03:43:19.729 --> 03:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
there's another means for him to
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
to know of that and yeah sometimes there
 
03:43:25.570 --> 03:43:25.580 align:start position:0%
might need to be a designee I mean
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
whoever the commissioner is if they're
 
03:43:30.650 --> 03:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
incapacitated or away or can't meet that
 
03:43:30.660 --> 03:43:31.490 align:start position:0%
incapacitated or away or can't meet that
meeting

03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
then the Deputy Commissioner should be
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
able to step in those shoes and be able
 
03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
to be just as knowledgeable
 
03:43:37.380 --> 03:43:39.530 align:start position:0%
to be just as knowledgeable
so

03:43:39.530 --> 03:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is provide reports provide them so
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could sign it does this
 
03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner have to be the one
 
03:43:49.969 --> 03:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
providing it or can that be done by
 
03:43:52.849 --> 03:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
a deputy or a designee like tomorrow I'm
 
03:43:53.950 --> 03:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
03:43:57.170 --> 03:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
acting on behalf of the speaker
 
03:44:00.170 --> 03:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
or in because I'm his designee right at
 
03:44:02.809 --> 03:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
the trustees so but I do come back and
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
tell him what transpired right and he
 
03:44:07.790 --> 03:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
tells me beforehand what he'd like or
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
not on a certain issue
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's as an administrator
 
03:44:13.969 --> 03:44:13.979 align:start position:0%
you don't always have
 
03:44:16.610 --> 03:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
yeah but you better be able to talk
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
about it yeah in detail and I mean we
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
saw a witness yesterday
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know that was reported that the what
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
there weren't some answers provided when
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
there should have been so it's a it's a
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
no situation if you're an expert in the
 
03:44:31.319 --> 03:44:32.389 align:start position:0%
no situation if you're an expert in the
field

03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
field
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
then you should know it
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know and I understand it's okay for
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
them to report it but I'm just looking
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
at who's responsible in the end if
 
03:44:43.610 --> 03:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
there's an era
 
03:44:43.620 --> 03:44:45.769 align:start position:0%
there's an era
somewhere

03:44:45.769 --> 03:44:45.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
who has to take the brunt of it so I'm
 
03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
completely you can delegate all the time
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
but the one that's still responsible is
 
03:44:55.130 --> 03:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
the person delegating that's true
 
03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
so if the commissioner delegates you're
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
going to take you know do this report
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah the commissioner knows he's still
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
responsible he better darn well know
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
what's in that report well you would
 
03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
what's in that report well you would
think

03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:45:07.929 --> 03:45:07.939 align:start position:0%
well you know I
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's all about leadership
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know what represent Tanner
 
03:45:16.370 --> 03:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
go back on this a little bit
 
03:45:18.889 --> 03:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and you see what actually you know
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
the all the different things that that
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
the department is doing you know assess
 
03:45:27.050 --> 03:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
a sign require require the Department's
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
doing all that and then it kind of comes
 
03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
doing all that and then it kind of comes
down

03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:45:32.809 --> 03:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh to the last and meet quarterly with
 
03:45:34.190 --> 03:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
school officials in the affected school
 
03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
to assess the progress and then as the
 
03:45:38.530 --> 03:45:38.540 align:start position:0%
as the culminary
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
Coleman well culminating thank you
 
03:45:44.690 --> 03:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
culminating thing the commissioner or
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner shall provide
 
03:45:48.769 --> 03:45:48.779 align:start position:0%
progress reports annually to the state
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
school board I think that's like the big
 
03:45:52.610 --> 03:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
thing at the end I don't think it's
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
something that that
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
um you know Department represent
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
Representatives or whatever just meet
 
03:46:01.250 --> 03:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
with the state school board I think this
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
is a a big thing so I would agree that
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's either the commissioner or the
 
03:46:06.980 --> 03:46:06.990 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:08.950 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner
[Applause]

03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
03:46:11.330 --> 03:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're happy to leave it
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner I mean I I don't think we
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
should really you know spend all day
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:22.250 --> 03:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
no no I I agree with that I mean we're
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
going through this to understand what
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
what changes are to 266 and to come up
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
with with I you know you know questions
 
03:46:32.210 --> 03:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
and yeah I think I put a question mark
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
in circle of the word commissioner we
 
03:46:36.410 --> 03:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
can work yeah we can vote for let's move
 
03:46:38.450 --> 03:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
on no I mean and I think your your point
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
is you know well taken and we hadn't
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
thought of those scenarios so
 
03:46:42.359 --> 03:46:43.849 align:start position:0%
thought of those scenarios so
yeah

03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
because it does run the next chair it
 
03:46:49.130 --> 03:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
does add more credibility however in
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude to that type of third report
 
03:46:53.690 --> 03:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner is doing it I
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe the destiny be more
 
03:46:57.050 --> 03:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
effective I didn't say it wouldn't be
 
03:46:59.769 --> 03:46:59.779 align:start position:0%
more effective that may be as well
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
but if they're also going to be taking
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
direction from the state board that's
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner taking direction from
 
03:47:08.330 --> 03:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
the state board not you know okay let's
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
put a circle around it and a question
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
mark and we'll come back let's go on
 
03:47:14.750 --> 03:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
page 29.
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee this is
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
where we moved the oversight committee
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
to from rsa193c which was about just
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
assessment to here
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
um same language uh we just thought this
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
was better positioned in this this
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
section of the statute rather the
 
03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
assessment section I know representative
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
you had some questions about blue Vega
 
03:47:34.610 --> 03:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
and the hierarchy of moving it so well
 
03:47:36.349 --> 03:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:47:38.990 --> 03:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
you uh if you reuse that whole section
 
03:47:40.849 --> 03:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
reference for something else
 
03:47:43.610 --> 03:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
so the question oh yeah so yeah so okay
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so we didn't we didn't get ready so
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't disappear no no okay I didn't
 
03:47:49.450 --> 03:47:49.460 align:start position:0%
change it
 
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah it did disappear
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
before and actually when we first
 
03:47:55.370 --> 03:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
started working on drafting this it
 
03:47:57.170 --> 03:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the law that we were using
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
because you had put it back in in
 
03:48:01.130 --> 03:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
between so yeah like oh it's just gone
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
then then much too hard to say
 
03:48:09.889 --> 03:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
you gotta buy more Green books yeah
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
we could put that law in this section
 
03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:12.849 align:start position:0%
we could put that law in this section
yeah

03:48:12.849 --> 03:48:12.859 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
well we you just testified on it
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
yesterday or yesterday yeah
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay page 30.
 
03:48:22.969 --> 03:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
so there is again just legal references
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
to from rsa193h to this chapter okay
 
03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:31.849 align:start position:0%
to from rsa193h to this chapter okay
so

03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.859 --> 03:48:33.769 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
this chapter refers to
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
well hold on you moved it to H right we
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
moved it from H so we combined e and H
 
03:48:45.170 --> 03:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
together and so
 
03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
um now all of this section is so the way
 
03:48:49.969 --> 03:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
it kind of it was choppy before because
 
03:48:52.010 --> 03:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
it talked about the accountability so
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
now all the accountability is at the
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
same piece and so now the oversight
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
committee is talking about the
 
03:48:59.210 --> 03:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
accountability in this chapter in 193 e
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
right which consolidates e and H down
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
Foley thanks
 
03:49:04.800 --> 03:49:07.450 align:start position:0%
Foley thanks
okay

03:49:07.450 --> 03:49:07.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:12.370 --> 03:49:12.380 align:start position:0%
that's 30 31 same thing
 
03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so I believe just from moved this
 
03:49:31.849 --> 03:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
um we didn't know why the accountability
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
um the legislative oversight commission
 
03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:36.779 align:start position:0%
for accountability was reviewing Sasa
 
03:49:36.779 --> 03:49:38.570 align:start position:0%
for accountability was reviewing Sasa
number

03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:49:40.190 --> 03:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
um information about our unique people
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
identifier system we were just very
 
03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
confused about the linkage of that in
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
general except for the fact that it kind
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
of falls under RSA 193e
 
03:49:52.130 --> 03:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
because this the unique identifier
 
03:49:54.170 --> 03:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
system is as we all know is a SAT I mean
 
03:49:56.690 --> 03:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
maybe this was appropriate 15 years ago
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
when the identifier system was invented
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
but it we just feel like there was a lot
 
03:50:04.130 --> 03:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
of Need for this yeah I think there's
 
03:50:06.530 --> 03:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
still a question well
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you last year we even
 
03:50:11.809 --> 03:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
you know realized or whatever had
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
happened that the the unique people
 
03:50:16.190 --> 03:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
identifier hadn't hadn't been used in
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools or
 
03:50:21.769 --> 03:50:21.779 align:start position:0%
esas or you know or they were and but
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
not in law that kind of thing and so I
 
03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
don't think it's I it's definitely the
 
03:50:30.590 --> 03:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
system is the system but who it applies
 
03:50:30.600 --> 03:50:32.210 align:start position:0%
system is the system but who it applies
to

03:50:32.210 --> 03:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
um is is an issue because somebody takes
 
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
state funded money then they should have
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
of people identifier right okay I
 
03:50:44.570 --> 03:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
I mean a valid way to look at it if you
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
want that language back in I don't think
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
it does anything the Department's
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
completely impartial to that is it
 
03:50:50.929 --> 03:50:50.939 align:start position:0%
someplace else I mean so we just we just
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
took it out of that because we didn't we
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't know why the committee
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
we were doing it we've used the unique
 
03:51:00.050 --> 03:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier no okay so it should
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
they're saying it should stay yeah yeah
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
I I I get that
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's part of the responsibility yes it
 
03:51:17.279 --> 03:51:18.469 align:start position:0%
that's part of the responsibility yes it
is

03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:51:18.479 --> 03:51:24.410 align:start position:0%
is
working

03:51:24.410 --> 03:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:27.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:27.290 --> 03:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:42.130 --> 03:51:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
why are we removing security there for a
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
long time
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
is it when we get
 
03:52:02.889 --> 03:52:02.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
a data inventory and policies
 
03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:26.990 align:start position:0%
a data inventory and policies
Publications

03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Publications
 
03:52:34.429 --> 03:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
I believe the reason we actually took
 
03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
this out was because the RSA 1936 18966
 
03:52:42.050 --> 03:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
already requires the department to issue
 
03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
an annual report to members of the
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
legislators legislature
 
03:52:48.530 --> 03:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so we didn't feel they needed to go
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
to this Commission in addition to
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
um this or the appropriate placement for
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
this law right here would be under RSA
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
1989 66 RSA 190 8966 requires a report
 
03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
to already go to the State Board of
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
Education the governor the Senate
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
President the Speaker of the House the
 
03:53:10.610 --> 03:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the senate committee
 
03:53:14.570 --> 03:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and house over commissioner and doit
 
03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
so we already felt like that was mostly
 
03:53:19.610 --> 03:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
covered here in this this section of the
 
03:53:24.130 --> 03:53:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.570 --> 03:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
I kind of think it should stay there
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
simply because it's
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
fairly difficult
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
um to find the reports that go to the
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
different people uh whereas the
 
03:53:37.309 --> 03:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee is
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
something that people will
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
be able to see and hear and
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of people at the same time review
 
03:53:44.279 --> 03:53:45.229 align:start position:0%
a lot of people at the same time review
it

03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:45.239 --> 03:53:46.250 align:start position:0%
it
so

03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion this is the
 
03:53:53.929 --> 03:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
is the our assassins part of the slds
 
03:53:53.939 --> 03:53:56.389 align:start position:0%
is the our assassins part of the slds
yes

03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:53:58.729 --> 03:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this goes hand in hand with
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:54:02.809 --> 03:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
group assassin part
 
03:54:04.929 --> 03:54:04.939 align:start position:0%
do we have any indication of how many
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
reports are done yearly on uh security
 
03:54:10.370 --> 03:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
breaches I'm wondering like how what
 
03:54:12.410 --> 03:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
level does this need to be at before it
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
comes to us
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
um we very rarely have any sort of
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to us
 
03:54:24.889 --> 03:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mary really have any security
 
03:54:26.510 --> 03:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
breaches and at this time they're mostly
 
03:54:28.849 --> 03:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
handled by doit even if a school has a
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
breach they reach out to a doit they
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
don't even necessarily work with the
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't this doesn't take into
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
consideration like when
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
um an individual School District's I.T
 
03:54:47.330 --> 03:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
is hacked and taken over and you know so
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
if a school district has an issue they
 
03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
oftentimes reach out to the department
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
the department of information
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
Technologies and they have a data
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
specialist that they'll work with them
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know if they're following
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at 189 66 it says there's
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
an annual report provided what happens
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
if the report are the breaches today
 
03:55:14.330 --> 03:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
is is any kind of report going to be
 
03:55:17.469 --> 03:55:17.479 align:start position:0%
communicated regarding that breach today
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
so so this could also include breaches
 
03:55:32.290 --> 03:55:32.300 align:start position:0%
um by you know not
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
directly by the by the department or a
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
um or a school but also by like the the
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
contractor who administers the state yes
 
03:55:46.729 --> 03:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
challenge we've never had a breach from
 
03:55:51.769 --> 03:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
our assessment vendor right right but
 
03:55:54.170 --> 03:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
but clearly we have in statute and we
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
saw yesterday right so yeah or a couple
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
well I'm not on one on 189.66 it says
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
well like you said Rick we don't have to
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
solve it today but I think identifying
 
03:56:20.330 --> 03:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
this is just a question concern area
 
03:56:22.610 --> 03:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
Yeah question mark yeah
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
let's keep moving
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
um so this is just a new section
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
um we actually proposed to OLS creating
 
03:56:37.969 --> 03:56:37.979 align:start position:0%
a whole new reporting section in general
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
but they didn't love that plan
 
03:56:42.170 --> 03:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
um something that
 
03:56:44.450 --> 03:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
this committee may want to consider is
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
having a reporting section of law that
 
03:56:48.889 --> 03:56:48.899 align:start position:0%
refers to all reporting that is required
 
03:56:51.290 --> 03:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
by School Districts I think it's very
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
hard that they have to flip through this
 
03:56:54.769 --> 03:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
book and guess which reports are
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to to be submitted at various
 
03:56:59.389 --> 03:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
different times but for the time being
 
03:56:59.399 --> 03:57:01.010 align:start position:0%
different times but for the time being
OLS

03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
um just uh came up with rsa193 k
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
and so uh this is where they moved uh
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
the slds language that was previously
 
03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.469 --> 03:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
one thing that we found was funny is we
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
all know what the word SAS it is but
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's no actual definition of sassadin
 
03:57:43.010 --> 03:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
law so I thought that was should be
 
03:57:48.889 --> 03:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:52.490 --> 03:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
looks like Jen did catch a typo from OLS
 
03:57:54.969 --> 03:57:54.979 align:start position:0%
those need to be assigned not assigned
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
back on page 32 does the definition of
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
Chartered Public School include
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
variations of Chartered Public Schools
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
so RSA 193 184b is all-encompassing
 
03:58:11.090 --> 03:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
that's the charter school law so it
 
03:58:14.570 --> 03:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
talks about conversions oh okay uh so
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's that of all charter schools
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
are there no no like like so you're
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
referencing back to 194b colon 1 to
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
Roman four
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
are you also addressing chart or gift
 
03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
card Charter conversion School
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a charter well yeah it is so
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
Charter's conversion School locally
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
sponsored Charter and safe one responses
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
Charter are all contained in RSA 194b
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
yes and they're all subject to state
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
board approval correct right so yeah
 
03:58:44.160 --> 03:58:45.710 align:start position:0%
board approval correct right so yeah
yeah

03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not a state board Charter
 
03:58:48.600 --> 03:58:51.530 align:start position:0%
so it's not a state board Charter
necessarily

03:58:51.530 --> 03:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
um on page 34 the after your assassin
 
03:58:57.469 --> 03:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
um the definition of that I understand
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be putting it out
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
unless you rfps on uh maybe other
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
organizations that are going to be
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with that money other than the
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
children's scholarships organization and
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
they may not have scholarship
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
organization in their name so
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
word that we could use there rather than
 
03:59:26.689 --> 03:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization the RSA and
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
establishing education Freedom accounts
 
03:59:30.050 --> 03:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
requires the use of a scholarship
 
03:59:32.570 --> 03:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
organization so for that purpose of that
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
program scholarship organization has
 
03:59:36.889 --> 03:59:36.899 align:start position:0%
already identified in law I do actually
 
03:59:38.870 --> 03:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
want to say I believe this is a typo I
 
03:59:41.170 --> 03:59:41.180 align:start position:0%
believe uh RSA
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
194e is actually Innovation school so it
 
03:59:46.969 --> 03:59:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so we should make that as a
 
03:59:50.809 --> 03:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
correction um but it specifically
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
requires scholar scholarship
 
03:59:54.410 --> 03:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
organization so that's what that is
 
03:59:56.030 --> 03:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
there okay because I thought I thought
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
required this a scholarship organization
 
04:00:02.929 --> 04:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
because it actually named the children's
 
04:00:04.370 --> 04:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
it does not name the children's
 
04:00:06.530 --> 04:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation no it says it
 
04:00:07.849 --> 04:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
requires the use of a scholarship
 
04:00:07.859 --> 04:00:09.410 align:start position:0%
requires the use of a scholarship
organization

04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:00:11.689 --> 04:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
so maybe I don't
 
04:00:11.699 --> 04:00:13.429 align:start position:0%
so maybe I don't
well

04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
I was going to think a non-profit
 
04:00:17.450 --> 04:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
organization is unique people identifier
 
04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.160 --> 04:00:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.050 --> 04:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
because we changed the word to Assassin
 
04:00:27.060 --> 04:00:31.729 align:start position:0%
because we changed the word to Assassin
okay

04:00:31.729 --> 04:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
does there have to be for folks to
 
04:00:35.809 --> 04:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
really understand the change how they
 
04:00:37.010 --> 04:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
can understand that change when they
 
04:00:40.250 --> 04:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
look up unique people identifier yeah we
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
Define we defined it purposely I'd
 
04:00:44.689 --> 04:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
actually say that people have a more
 
04:00:46.490 --> 04:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
relationship with the word sasid number
 
04:00:47.689 --> 04:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
than they have a unique of people
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
identifier so if you were to talk about
 
04:00:51.050 --> 04:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
that people will do I don't know what
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
that is but if you said sassa Denver
 
04:00:54.769 --> 04:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
like oh okay that and that was actually
 
04:00:56.450 --> 04:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
part of the confusion because people all
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
the time would say I'm looking for the
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
law that establishes Sasa numbers where
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
is it you'd Google that you couldn't
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
come up with it and so okay
 
04:01:04.920 --> 04:01:08.030 align:start position:0%
come up with it and so okay
foreign

04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.040 --> 04:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
35

04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're again using changing unique people
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
that are virus acid again we and then we
 
04:01:23.570 --> 04:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.290 --> 04:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know why this is out we talked
 
04:01:35.210 --> 04:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
about how it's possibly why is it
 
04:01:35.220 --> 04:01:36.410 align:start position:0%
about how it's possibly why is it
removing

04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
removing
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so Nate and I talked about this we
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
think this is a mistake
 
04:01:42.650 --> 04:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
um mistake this shouldn't be added back
 
04:01:44.769 --> 04:01:44.779 align:start position:0%
it should be added over there
 
04:01:48.650 --> 04:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
on page 36 e
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
when we went through this copy neither
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
Caitlin or I had removed that sections
 
04:01:54.410 --> 04:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
we were surprised to see that was
 
04:02:00.250 --> 04:02:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
so it just somehow it just disappeared
 
04:02:06.769 --> 04:02:06.779 align:start position:0%
yes yeah there are multiple versions
 
04:02:09.410 --> 04:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
that were sent to OLS and came back from
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.319 --> 04:02:15.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:15.290 --> 04:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:22.370 --> 04:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
12 36. yeah that's why I was going 36 37
 
04:02:26.340 --> 04:02:37.090 align:start position:0%
12 36. yeah that's why I was going 36 37
but

04:02:37.090 --> 04:02:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.100 --> 04:02:38.769 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:02:38.769 --> 04:02:38.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
I think anybody that searches for a Sasa
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
number is going to record somebody who's
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
searching for assassin number
 
04:02:48.889 --> 04:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
so if I were to go in and search for
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
Assassin's number I would say Caitlin
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
Davis search for assassin number in our
 
04:02:53.450 --> 04:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
system it wouldn't be you wouldn't be
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
able to do it anonymously it would
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually maintain a
 
04:02:56.760 --> 04:02:57.590 align:start position:0%
actually maintain a
um

04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
like an audit like a technical trail
 
04:03:00.359 --> 04:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
like an audit like a technical trail
that

04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
so the system is
 
04:03:06.359 --> 04:03:08.050 align:start position:0%
so the system is
just

04:03:08.050 --> 04:03:08.060 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:03:11.170 --> 04:03:11.180 align:start position:0%
I mean that's what it is
 
04:03:13.130 --> 04:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
acid numbers it's a random number
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
generator so we have new students yeah
 
04:03:15.479 --> 04:03:16.610 align:start position:0%
generator so we have new students yeah
yeah

04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:03:18.050 --> 04:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
but we could we could change it to this
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
acid system or something like that yes
 
04:03:21.849 --> 04:03:21.859 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:03:24.290 --> 04:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
right right and that that actually that
 
04:03:27.969 --> 04:03:27.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
unique people identifier everywhere it's
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
in statute to different I believe we
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
tried to do that so what about the ball
 
04:03:38.929 --> 04:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
on page 36 probably bottom line yes sir
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
yep that's a miss so yes I should say
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:44.800 --> 04:03:48.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
unless they were concerned earlier about
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
people actually mucking with the random
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
Generate random number generator and
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure that uh if
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
anybody went into muck with it they
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
would know
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
including you know whatever programmers
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:05.160 --> 04:04:09.610 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:04:09.610 --> 04:04:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:12.050 --> 04:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
but the generator so it's no longer
 
04:04:12.060 --> 04:04:15.110 align:start position:0%
but the generator so it's no longer
random

04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.600 --> 04:04:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
what is meant by Educational Services
 
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's a broad term
 
04:04:56.830 --> 04:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
random number generator occurs again on
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the next day I would have to just do a
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
control F on that one and uh double
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
check on those
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do that yeah it just in case they
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
were meaning the random number generator
 
04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
you might want to check with the data
 
04:05:13.500 --> 04:05:27.530 align:start position:0%
you might want to check with the data
people

04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.540 --> 04:05:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating the person we
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
so that you want the whole system to be
 
04:05:56.050 --> 04:05:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
all the other information that's
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
personally identified with both source
 
04:06:01.859 --> 04:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
personally identified with both source
okay

04:06:04.250 --> 04:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:11.340 --> 04:06:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:15.790 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:06:15.790 --> 04:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
so the whole idea about the staff is so
 
04:06:19.020 --> 04:06:20.410 align:start position:0%
so the whole idea about the staff is so
bad

04:06:20.410 --> 04:06:20.420 align:start position:0%
bad
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
information could be sent that it's not
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
personally identified right and so once
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has the the mapping of ass acid
 
04:06:32.929 --> 04:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
and a name like Steve Woodcock well now
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
so so the whole idea is to is to ensure
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
anonymity and protection of of
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
um personally pii so
 
04:06:43.859 --> 04:06:47.710 align:start position:0%
um personally pii so
thanks

04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
it is relatively broad so the intent of
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
the paragraph is to ensure that things
 
04:07:02.330 --> 04:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
outside of Education don't have an
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
ability to require individuals to
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
provide a sasset as a condition of doing
 
04:07:06.060 --> 04:07:07.130 align:start position:0%
provide a sasset as a condition of doing
business

04:07:07.130 --> 04:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
so education here in the term of
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
Educational Services is exempt because
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
SAS is often used in the provision of
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
many different kinds of educational
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
services but for example if a student
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
were applying for a job at a local
 
04:07:20.330 --> 04:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
restaurant that restaurant would be
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited from requiring a sasset as a
 
04:07:23.929 --> 04:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
condition of employment
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
but I agree the word or the term
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
Educational Services itself is not
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.000 --> 04:07:37.010 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:07:37.010 --> 04:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
I don't know
[Music]

04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
so the cross of Medicare is is specific
 
04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
to a federal law that will enable that
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we would have to apply for a waiver
 
04:07:52.150 --> 04:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
so under this HHS would not get Sasa
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
numbers and would not collect Sasa
 
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
numbers it's the Department of Education
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
that would do that matching and maintain
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
that matching we would get a file that
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
had names and whatnot but but they don't
 
04:08:09.290 --> 04:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
have any assassin information so it
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be affected by this
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay I had a question about that term
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
too Educational Services what are some
 
04:08:20.150 --> 04:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
examples where you would give out the
 
04:08:22.490 --> 04:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
student's name or they would be able to
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
get the student's name versus the
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
Assassin number or I mean what are some
 
04:08:27.720 --> 04:08:28.910 align:start position:0%
Assassin number or I mean what are some
examples

04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
examples
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
um specifically relative to the efas so
 
04:08:34.969 --> 04:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
those the EFA needs assassin number to
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
be able to apply for a Sasa number they
 
04:08:38.570 --> 04:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
need to okay so then the student of
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
course because the family name what
 
04:08:42.530 --> 04:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
about the scholarship fund
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
so efas are managed by the scholarship
 
04:08:47.809 --> 04:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
fund so yeah it does get the number and
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
the student name yes
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
because they are generating assassin
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
just like the schools are generating
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
Assassin of course they try to collect a
 
04:08:58.250 --> 04:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
Sasa number
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and if they're unable to collect this
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
asset number then they'll go in and
 
04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
generate assassin number in the exact
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
same way a school will and the
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
application goes to the scholarship fund
 
04:09:08.330 --> 04:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's why they would need it
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Caitlin do you see any
 
04:09:13.490 --> 04:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
any possible breach on that with the
 
04:09:16.130 --> 04:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
with the Career Technical head that that
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
assassin because these kids are
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know working out in the field I
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned like a restaurant
 
04:09:24.349 --> 04:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of you know where they're
 
04:09:26.809 --> 04:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
actually through the school working
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
in an automotive shop or something
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
through career Ed is there any any way
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
they don't get sassered at all
 
04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
they would end um and I don't
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they would need it okay
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
um well unless money was exchanged there
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
somehow right but it still that wouldn't
 
04:09:48.110 --> 04:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
be necessarily the educational service
 
04:09:49.490 --> 04:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
provider they wouldn't be the one that's
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know issuing the credit and whatnot
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
we could work on a definition of
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
Education Services maybe that's what
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be here okay just just as a
 
04:10:00.000 --> 04:10:06.490 align:start position:0%
needs to be here okay just just as a
definition

04:10:06.490 --> 04:10:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'm patreon right now I was talking with
 
04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
Aaron yeah
 
04:10:11.220 --> 04:10:16.010 align:start position:0%
Aaron yeah
37.

04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
did you get a definition of uh Education
 
04:10:18.779 --> 04:10:21.290 align:start position:0%
did you get a definition of uh Education
Services

04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
it needs one
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
I actually
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that we do and I'm not sure
 
04:10:28.370 --> 04:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we are the ones that took this out
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
we'll have to double check this it could
 
04:10:31.250 --> 04:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
probably just put the legal reference
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
back in what is yeah okay yeah yeah I
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that it I don't know that
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
that needs to be removed I think just
 
04:10:41.330 --> 04:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
putting back there I think maybe when
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
all of everything got moved around I
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
think that's potentially why that got
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
changed okay but yeah that makes sense
 
04:10:52.010 --> 04:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
anything else on page 37
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's go at 38.
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
that looks pretty clean I really don't
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't we didn't think it
 
04:11:25.490 --> 04:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
meant anything relative to this chapter
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
do we need to have something like you
 
04:11:32.100 --> 04:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
do we need to have something like you
know

04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get them to talk with
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that uh
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
but we don't think that this law enables
 
04:11:48.530 --> 04:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
well they're sharing transcripts and the
 
04:11:52.969 --> 04:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is not involved
 
04:11:55.010 --> 04:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
in that but the community college system
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
four-year system shares information
 
04:12:04.210 --> 04:12:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that's good does it continue to
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
does that does that information contain
 
04:12:12.530 --> 04:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
sacid are we still in Assassin but we're
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
taking it out right
 
04:12:17.809 --> 04:12:17.819 align:start position:0%
why are we taking it out
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh we just we didn't know what the
 
04:12:22.010 --> 04:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
purpose of it was
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
but it says it says like we're not
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
involved with their share it's
 
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
completely unrelated to the Department
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
of Ed and can people share anything of
 
04:12:33.170 --> 04:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
this information doing dual concurrent
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
enrollment where we have high school
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
kids going to community college system
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh so all that information is done
 
04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
locally yeah so all of that student
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
information is held by the local school
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
districts and that shared
 
04:12:47.689 --> 04:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
um at the permission of students and
 
04:12:48.889 --> 04:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
their families between the local school
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
district and the University Systems so
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
we're not a data pass through really in
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
any way for the University system or the
 
04:12:58.969 --> 04:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
community college system and students
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
so and and this is relative to the
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
Community College and the university
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
system being able to talk to each other
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
so now we have without asking us for
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
profession funnel through the department
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
anymore goes directly to doesn't it to
 
04:13:12.170 --> 04:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
the Community College systems so maybe
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's a cleanup we just we I have no
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
idea what this is saying and telling us
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
to do because we're not involved
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't think it needed to be here if
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
you want to leave it in here I suppose
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
you can but
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's kind of just words for the purpose
 
04:13:29.689 --> 04:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
of being words
 
04:13:31.729 --> 04:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
does does
 
04:13:35.210 --> 04:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
either does does any um any school
 
04:13:38.210 --> 04:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
Beyond any post-secondary
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
um receive information that has both
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
assassin and the student's name in it
 
04:13:47.330 --> 04:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
we don't share that with not that I know
 
04:13:47.340 --> 04:13:48.410 align:start position:0%
we don't share that with not that I know
of

04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:13:50.090 --> 04:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
right because that's the part that's
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
confidential right you either have the
 
04:13:53.330 --> 04:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
sassador you have the student name but
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
you never have both right correct yeah
 
04:13:55.560 --> 04:13:57.530 align:start position:0%
you never have both right correct yeah
yeah

04:13:57.530 --> 04:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
um but but this is still this is just
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
the university system in the college
 
04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
system right so if it involved assassin
 
04:14:06.650 --> 04:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
then there's probably something I I
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't I don't even know that they use
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
it mostly them to use that but I I don't
 
04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
think that they do I I don't know I just
 
04:14:23.809 --> 04:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
I think it could probably come out you
 
04:14:23.819 --> 04:14:26.030 align:start position:0%
I think it could probably come out you
know

04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
you got unique people identified all
 
04:14:30.410 --> 04:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
through this thing too
 
04:14:30.420 --> 04:14:35.410 align:start position:0%
through this thing too
um

04:14:35.410 --> 04:14:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:38.210 --> 04:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
they're pursuing
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so the car in law has a mistake in
 
04:14:40.319 --> 04:14:41.330 align:start position:0%
yeah so the car in law has a mistake in
it

04:14:41.330 --> 04:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:14:44.570 --> 04:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
and both o and P
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
two lines four we have unique yeah
 
04:14:50.570 --> 04:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
that's another one so does o on the
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
fourth line still has unique people well
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's all through that everywhere oh yeah
 
04:14:56.279 --> 04:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
it's all through that everywhere oh yeah
everyone

04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay anything else uh
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
I guess we have no purpose for that part
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.319 --> 04:15:11.170 align:start position:0%
 
there

04:15:11.170 --> 04:15:11.180 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
had to be something something somewhere
 
04:15:22.130 --> 04:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.250 --> 04:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
What's um on page 40 I guess we're on
 
04:15:27.650 --> 04:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
page 40. I don't know notwithstanding
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 14 colon 49.
 
04:15:32.809 --> 04:15:32.819 align:start position:0%
the department didn't add that in OLS
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
added that in so I'm not sure what that
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
reference is for I don't know it's not
 
04:15:39.650 --> 04:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
in our law book I don't think it's not
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I don't know what that
 
04:15:44.450 --> 04:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
legal reference is anybody has a laptop
 
04:15:44.460 --> 04:15:45.950 align:start position:0%
legal reference is anybody has a laptop
or

04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:15:45.960 --> 04:15:49.689 align:start position:0%
or
important

04:15:49.689 --> 04:15:49.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.889 --> 04:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
genocide so yeah I'm guessing that the
 
04:15:54.110 --> 04:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
law probably on this on establishing
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
study committees Maybe
 
04:16:00.110 --> 04:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
14 49 maybe a processor procedure or was
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.319 --> 04:16:07.389 align:start position:0%
 
or

04:16:07.389 --> 04:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.399 --> 04:16:09.189 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
1449 what limits the size and
 
04:16:15.290 --> 04:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
membership of a committee representative
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
Damon is just for you yeah that's I
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
think that's so it's saying that forget
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
about that you can
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
oh and that's you know what it's because
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
OLS actually they were concerned with
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
this because it has more than the number
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
of people that you're supposed to have
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they're saying that but because it
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
was established before that and is in
 
04:16:34.250 --> 04:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
law it's all set but going forward even
 
04:16:35.929 --> 04:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
if it's established after you'd still be
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
able because it's in law
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to fight with the drafting
 
04:16:39.840 --> 04:16:40.990 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to fight with the drafting
attorneys

04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
04:16:44.929 --> 04:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
no but that's what that's getting at
 
04:16:46.560 --> 04:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
no but that's what that's getting at
yeah

04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
amen so we made no changes to the
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.520 --> 04:17:14.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
do we have to finish this today can we
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
I think that's you know not much left in
 
04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
there I think it's good yeah yeah we've
 
04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.020 --> 04:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:17:54.000 --> 04:17:55.490 align:start position:0%
thanks
mostly

04:17:55.490 --> 04:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
04:17:58.150 --> 04:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
keeping kind of things
 
04:18:01.130 --> 04:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just I'll remind the committee
 
04:18:04.250 --> 04:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
kind of how this came about so
 
04:18:04.260 --> 04:18:04.969 align:start position:0%
kind of how this came about so
um

04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the summer slash fall
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the department
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
so about the department the division my
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
division division of Education analytics
 
04:18:17.090 --> 04:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
and resources inherited the assessment
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
program it was previously run by the
 
04:18:21.769 --> 04:18:21.779 align:start position:0%
division of learner support
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
um that's something that historically
 
04:18:25.010 --> 04:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
was together at the Department of
 
04:18:28.370 --> 04:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
Education was separated for a period of
 
04:18:30.410 --> 04:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
time and then brought back together it
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
really makes sense for it to be together
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of data exchange there's a
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
lot of the same understanding of
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
programs so that was one of the pieces
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of brought this about
 
04:18:41.689 --> 04:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
um to the second piece I kind of brought
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
this about is in the 2223 biennium
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
budget the Department of Education was
 
04:18:48.650 --> 04:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
given a position to start overseeing
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
State accountability so previously all
 
04:18:52.969 --> 04:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
of the state accountability positions
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
that are removed from the Department of
 
04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
education's budget and had have been for
 
04:18:59.570 --> 04:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
several years and so we received one
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
position and so would that person began
 
04:19:03.290 --> 04:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
doing that work and putting that
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
together for the Department we really
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
did a deep dive into the law and said
 
04:19:11.650 --> 04:19:11.660 align:start position:0%
all right well you know this makes sense
 
04:19:14.570 --> 04:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make sense and then part of
 
04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
this was um
 
04:19:16.140 --> 04:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
this was um
so

04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um there were two relatively large
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that were made that
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
were had not been implemented or tried
 
04:19:26.330 --> 04:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
or tried to be implemented by the
 
04:19:28.610 --> 04:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
department until this time and so
 
04:19:30.889 --> 04:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
um those changes were the change of the
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
state pbas the performance-based
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
accountability system from going from
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
something that was designated in state
 
04:19:38.929 --> 04:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
law to um tying it to the federal
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
accountability system
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so that happened in 2017 and 18. so
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
even though the law change in the
 
04:19:48.110 --> 04:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
department hadn't implemented because we
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have to have the staff to do that
 
04:19:53.330 --> 04:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
and then the other legislative change
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
that happened was the change from
 
04:19:59.450 --> 04:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
a school being required to demonstrate
 
04:20:00.650 --> 04:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
that they're providing an adequate
 
04:20:04.370 --> 04:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
education through either ibas or pvas to
 
04:20:06.110 --> 04:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
having to demonstrate it through both
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
imass and pbas so that's when we kind of
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
sat down and tried to do all of that
 
04:20:14.090 --> 04:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
work with the with the combination of
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the assessment
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
um working this uh assigned to my
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
division and then also that position and
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
so we've done all that work in in
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
culmination or together and really come
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
up with all right well there are some
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
things that just made no sense about the
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
law or something that just were just
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
very unclear we were kind of confused by
 
04:20:37.969 --> 04:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
or we thought that there were sections
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
of law that weren't necessarily doing
 
04:20:39.779 --> 04:20:41.450 align:start position:0%
of law that weren't necessarily doing
anything

04:20:41.450 --> 04:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and so actually I went back and read
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
my notes and I saw it after our
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee meeting last week and I saw
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
the word competency and who are very
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
concerned that the word competency was
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
deleted but my notes had said that we
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
didn't actually use the word competency
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
throughout this so that's kind of where
 
04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
all this came from so it was kind of a
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
pet project of Nate and I to try to get
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves a law that actually made sense
 
04:21:07.370 --> 04:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
that we could Implement
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
um with the limited resources that we
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
have at the department right now to best
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
leverage our federal funds to kind of do
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
some of this work and then our state
 
04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
funds but then also be able to implement
 
04:21:22.969 --> 04:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
A system that we could communicate to
 
04:21:25.010 --> 04:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
the schools that so that's really where
 
04:21:26.809 --> 04:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
we are here at the department
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
um we've been implementing the
 
04:21:29.929 --> 04:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
assessment program this spring Nate has
 
04:21:31.969 --> 04:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
done a ton of work with that um and we
 
04:21:34.010 --> 04:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
felt that it's gone very well
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um and we are going to begin to do some
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the asset uh the accountability work
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
this fall um we intend to anyways
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
assuming this enabling legislation will
 
04:21:45.420 --> 04:21:46.670 align:start position:0%
assuming this enabling legislation will
pass

04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:21:49.610 --> 04:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and we should hopefully kind of start
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
rolling that out and communicating with
 
04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
the schools so we have some uh technical
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
assistance advisory that we would like
 
04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
to provide to the schools this spring
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
letting them know about what the
 
04:21:59.929 --> 04:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
accountability schedule for the fall is
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
but we it's kind of contingent on
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
knowing where the committee wants to go
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
with some of this work do you have this
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
report I can't see that you can't see
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
um this has within it
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
um text of current statutes not
 
04:22:26.090 --> 04:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:29.760 --> 04:22:33.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:33.370 --> 04:22:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.050 --> 04:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
it is just kind of the first few pages
 
04:22:41.530 --> 04:22:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
 that one right there and then and
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
um you know where the
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
three chapters are repealed and
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
reenacted or 193h is just repeal and
 
04:22:56.590 --> 04:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
with those sections that I didn't locate
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
within the new versions of the chapters
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
um and I just pasted those sections
 
04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
again at the end in their articles
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
so you don't have a copy of that I I
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't with me the first part is the
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
and it's continued here continued on the
 
04:23:21.130 --> 04:23:21.140 align:start position:0%
next page
 
04:23:22.969 --> 04:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
there's areas which have been
 
04:23:26.210 --> 04:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
Incorporated but others that are just
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
there's holes
 
04:23:28.199 --> 04:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
there's holes
um

04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
maybe you need to have a copy of this
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
because there's about
 
04:23:35.929 --> 04:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
yeah it must be about six or seven pages
 
04:23:39.889 --> 04:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
here on areas which are not included did
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
you already know well because I can I
 
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.010 --> 04:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:01.010 --> 04:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot that was removed only
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it was duplicative of the
 
04:24:04.969 --> 04:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
federal law there were a lot in the
 
04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
federal law that just was pasted into
 
04:24:10.010 --> 04:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
the state law and we Nate and I felt
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
that was not necessary
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so if that
 
04:24:16.729 --> 04:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
if that's the kind like I know first
 
04:24:18.769 --> 04:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
example in College and Career Readiness
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
indicators were listed in the state law
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
well they're compliant with the federal
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
program so if we were to add a new
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicator
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
to the federal program in the federal
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
plan now all of a sudden the state law
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
is not going to tie to that so that's
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
but you know this page right here which
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
has all those indicators of a delivery
 
04:24:41.150 --> 04:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
delivering an opportunity for an
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
as a Litany of of areas which uh we get
 
04:24:49.969 --> 04:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
information back on the number of kids
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
doing this the number of percentage of
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
kids doing that number of kids that do
 
04:24:56.929 --> 04:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
the ASVAB it just no those are the yeah
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
those are the College and Career
 
04:25:00.410 --> 04:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
editingness indicators that um so we
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
refer back to the federal law on that so
 
04:25:05.150 --> 04:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
all that we refer back to these I look
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
at these all the time right and all of
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
those are still there and we will
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
collect all of that information they're
 
04:25:12.650 --> 04:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
all part of the performance-based
 
04:25:14.330 --> 04:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
accountability system
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
so so in order to when we are looking at
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
CSI designations for example College of
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
kubernetes indicators are part of the
 
04:25:24.410 --> 04:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
CSI determination at this at the high
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
school level and so we would be
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
collecting and determining that
 
04:25:27.239 --> 04:25:28.490 align:start position:0%
collecting and determining that
information

04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
um that is part of the whole the whole
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
definition and in our federal our
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
federal plan
 
04:25:36.110 --> 04:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
and so we agree we're not we're not
 
04:25:38.090 --> 04:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
trying to eliminate that at all
 
04:25:40.010 --> 04:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
I think part of the problem of not
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
putting those in here is that a lot of
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
us just look in the state laws to see
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
what the state laws say and we don't
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily have easy access to the
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal laws or know even where to look
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
for the particular thing so if
 
04:25:58.370 --> 04:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
if it's laid out in here
 
04:26:01.729 --> 04:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
well and and so to mitigate your concern
 
04:26:03.710 --> 04:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
we specifically have added references
 
04:26:05.809 --> 04:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
into the state plan and defined what the
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
state plan is before there wasn't some
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
of that information and we felt that
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
that was really important to have a
 
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
definition of Essa and what smnn and the
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
definition of esea and the plan and and
 
04:26:19.849 --> 04:26:19.859 align:start position:0%
whatnot so if
 
04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
so if we just have this
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
are there sufficient references so that
 
04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
anything that's in state law and that's
 
04:26:31.370 --> 04:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
in federal law that we would need to
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
know this would have references to that
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we would be able to find that we
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.319 --> 04:26:50.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:26:50.290 --> 04:26:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's all the stuff that was
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
so this report right here is a
 
04:27:04.610 --> 04:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
requirement of not just the feds but
 
04:27:07.010 --> 04:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
also the state correct
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
so if we as a state are saying we want
 
04:27:11.889 --> 04:27:11.899 align:start position:0%
to have this information
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
for every school district
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
where would we go you know where would
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
we go to get this information
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
are you collecting this information we
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
are yes
 
04:27:25.260 --> 04:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
are yes
yes

04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
now if we take that out is there going
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
to be any information there at the
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
districts and say we're not required to
 
04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
do that now no well so right now the
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
state law says you're required to do
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the in the plan
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
so in the plan in the plan not in
 
04:27:44.929 --> 04:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
statute no it says in the plan well the
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
so our concern really was that we didn't
 
04:27:52.969 --> 04:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
want one changing without the other
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
change and we kind of there was a while
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
that we were living with that even
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
though the department wasn't
 
04:27:58.610 --> 04:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
implementing it and we were having we
 
04:27:58.620 --> 04:27:59.630 align:start position:0%
implementing it and we were having we
had

04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
State CSI oh sorry we had State local
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
education Improvement schools or
 
04:28:07.130 --> 04:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
something like that we had cities this
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that though this
 
04:28:12.410 --> 04:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
is inadequacy so that that was was
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
inadequacy before yeah because we want
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
that information from everybody it's an
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
indicator of having an opportunity for
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
an adequate education right and and so
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
we we the department in 2017 or 18 we
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
actually tied our adequacy law to the
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
federal plan
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
so that so wait so the list of data and
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty extensive list of data
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
there that's all required to be
 
04:28:40.729 --> 04:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
collected by federal statute as well and
 
04:28:41.929 --> 04:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
that's what the performance-based
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
accountability system is so in the state
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
statute when you look at P bass at the
 
04:28:48.110 --> 04:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
two different parts of accountability
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
ibas and bass pbas is that collection of
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
data indicators there and that's all
 
04:28:57.050 --> 04:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
detailed out on the state Essa plan so
 
04:28:58.610 --> 04:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether we list it here in
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
the stature or not we the department is
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
required to collect all that data under
 
04:29:04.849 --> 04:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
federal statute as well what we've done
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
here is we've we've tied that list of
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
data and indicators to the pbas so by
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
telling districts you have to meet the
 
04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're saying you have to provide all of
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
this federally required data and show us
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
that you're meeting certain benchmarks
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
and expectations when it comes to
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
measuring the performance of a school
 
04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
so it's in a way it's not that it's it's
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
missing or gone we still have to collect
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
the data no matter what we've just
 
04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
identified here in the statute that an
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
adequate education is tied to pbas and
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
pbas is a collection of these indicators
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
which is in the state as a plan and I
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
think to Caitlyn's point one of the
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
problems is when we list out indicators
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the state law and we have the
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
indicators listed in federal law we have
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the indicators in our state asset plan
 
04:29:53.090 --> 04:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
anytime one of those changes now we're
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
out of compliance across three different
 
04:29:56.570 --> 04:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
areas so that's part of the problem
 
04:29:57.889 --> 04:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix here is by
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
referencing the performance-based
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
accountability system and our federally
 
04:30:03.889 --> 04:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
required data which matches this list
 
04:30:05.450 --> 04:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
then if the feds at some point change
 
04:30:07.969 --> 04:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
that or if the state decides we need to
 
04:30:09.649 --> 04:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
submit a new state plan because some
 
04:30:11.630 --> 04:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
other statute has changed the list can
 
04:30:13.969 --> 04:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
stay consistent but the data will always
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
be collected by the department
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
but you see when we were had to study
 
04:30:23.170 --> 04:30:23.180 align:start position:0%
Commission on funding back
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.969 --> 04:30:30.979 align:start position:0%
and I can remember Val who was fanchak
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at the Bia the
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
business industry Association we're also
 
04:30:37.610 --> 04:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
looking at Career Technical education
 
04:30:40.729 --> 04:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
and he opened up his his book here
 
04:30:43.250 --> 04:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
and he said look at this this is what
 
04:30:45.290 --> 04:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
one two three four different places that
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned CTE underneath adequacy
 
04:30:51.769 --> 04:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
and under these indicators right here
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
that is identified but if this doesn't
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
appear in statute and it's in an s a
 
04:30:58.439 --> 04:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
appear in statute and it's in an s a
plan

04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be captured by a
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
person like Val who was trying to
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
justify in that conversation we had why
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
we should be funding CTE more
 
04:31:11.809 --> 04:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
or through adequacy
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so I it's to me where it is in
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
statute it's easy to find it's there and
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
people see it but if it's an Essa
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I never pull this up so the the
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
problem with doing that and having them
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
listen separately is if there's changes
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
and now we have slightly different
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
versions of each one now we're going to
 
04:31:36.769 --> 04:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
have slightly different lists of schools
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
that are low performing schools so we're
 
04:31:41.330 --> 04:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
going to have Federal low performing
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
schools and then we're going to have
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
state low performing schools even though
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're the same students in the same
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
measurements and same metrics
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so that's when we tie them all
 
04:31:52.010 --> 04:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
together that's what we are trying to
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
avoid because we didn't want to have
 
04:31:55.490 --> 04:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
schools that were not finding adequate
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
education but seemed fine federally or
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
schools that seemed failing federally
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
but were considered providing an
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
adequate education so I don't know what
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is
 
04:32:10.969 --> 04:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
um as far as you know making sure that
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
they all shift together
 
04:32:15.729 --> 04:32:15.739 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:32:18.530 --> 04:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
because if we change one and then we you
 
04:32:19.969 --> 04:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
know there's a whole process of changing
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
our federal plan we you have to ask you
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
know permission for the feds it takes
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
months on end for them to review but
 
04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
there has been like a lot of a lot of
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
conversations around for example those
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
College and Career ready indicators and
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
if we should be changing those or not
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
and then so what happens if now we just
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a stateless of College and Career
 
04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicators and then a
 
04:32:39.659 --> 04:32:40.670 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicators and then a
federalist

04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
federalist
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
but isn't it our responsibility as a
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
state to decide what it is that we want
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
and not just uh whatever the federal
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
government says and if we take it out
 
04:32:57.410 --> 04:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
then it's just whatever the federal
 
04:32:59.889 --> 04:32:59.899 align:start position:0%
government says and we no longer have
 
04:33:03.789 --> 04:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
that say as far as we may want
 
04:33:08.029 --> 04:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
stronger recommend you know we may have
 
04:33:10.730 --> 04:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
want to do something stronger or
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
whatever than the federal government is
 
04:33:13.680 --> 04:33:14.510 align:start position:0%
whatever than the federal government is
um

04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
you do have that Authority as a state
 
04:33:18.051 --> 04:33:18.061 align:start position:0%
but that is not what the intention of
 
04:33:19.730 --> 04:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
the state law currently is the state law
 
04:33:21.650 --> 04:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
the intention is to have them tied
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
together and that's also partially
 
04:33:25.250 --> 04:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
because of resources that the Department
 
04:33:27.410 --> 04:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
of Education because we don't have
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
anybody that's paid with State funds to
 
04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
do I know you have this accountability
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
work and so without having those
 
04:33:34.250 --> 04:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
staffers we're basically getting a
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
two-for-one deal we're paying somebody
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
with a federal money to do the
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
calculation but we're using it for State
 
04:33:40.609 --> 04:33:40.619 align:start position:0%
purpose as well so we're going to need
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
somebody to run a state list and a
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
federalist simultaneously going forward
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
so that's another concern
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:33:47.939 --> 04:33:49.609 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
so

04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
so uh you know along you know I I
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand why your intention here and I
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
think I think it makes sense but um but
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
at the same time you know I wouldn't
 
04:34:01.730 --> 04:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
want to see us lose
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
um data collection because maybe a
 
04:34:05.810 --> 04:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
change is made at the federal level that
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
no longer collects certain data because
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
they don't see it necessary for all 50
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
states and um and maybe in New Hampshire
 
04:34:15.890 --> 04:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
we we want to see it necessary and and
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that's worth having a debate
 
04:34:21.650 --> 04:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
every few years when the um when the
 
04:34:23.890 --> 04:34:23.900 align:start position:0%
when the um the federal
 
04:34:26.449 --> 04:34:26.459 align:start position:0%
where when there are changes made at the
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
federal level whether we want to adopt
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
those changes or whether we want to Inc
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know include some of the things that
 
04:34:36.529 --> 04:34:36.539 align:start position:0%
we have historically collected
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and and you know I guess right here
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
we're we're you know based on what you
 
04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
know you you've said that what we're
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
eliminating is what contained at the um
 
04:34:51.170 --> 04:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
at the US Ed you know in US Ed rules but
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
um but we won't know when those us rules
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
change because we don't have a usn rule
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
law book you know so it's actually it's
 
04:35:02.929 --> 04:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in the control of New
 
04:35:05.209 --> 04:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than that and I probably I
 
04:35:06.890 --> 04:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
think I did a poor job explaining it the
 
04:35:09.890 --> 04:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
first time so the whatever we write into
 
04:35:12.051 --> 04:35:12.061 align:start position:0%
our state Essa plan is what we're held
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
to by the federal statute and so
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
different states may have different
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
lists of data and indicators and so it's
 
04:35:21.410 --> 04:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
only if our state plan change like if we
 
04:35:23.689 --> 04:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
decide New Hampshire decides to rewrite
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
our state plan that's when that list of
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
data and indicators would change it
 
04:35:28.369 --> 04:35:28.379 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be a change
 
04:35:30.769 --> 04:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
initiated by the federal government and
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
when we talk I think there's a section
 
04:35:34.131 --> 04:35:34.141 align:start position:0%
in the legislative oversight committee
 
04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
that talked about the performance
 
04:35:37.369 --> 04:35:37.379 align:start position:0%
targets so this list of data in the
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
state Esso plan has Associated
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
performance targets which can be
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by that
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee so my
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
guess is there would be some involved if
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
any kind of change were to be
 
04:35:49.369 --> 04:35:49.379 align:start position:0%
recommended to the state as a plan
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
they'd probably be involvement by this
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
legislative body in terms of any of
 
04:35:55.310 --> 04:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
04:35:57.170 --> 04:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
so in that sense we're lucky because the
 
04:35:58.730 --> 04:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
feds can't just come in and change that
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
list we defined that list and we took
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
essentially what was in our state
 
04:36:03.769 --> 04:36:03.779 align:start position:0%
statute and we stuck it into our state
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
plan and that's why they match is we we
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
did an intentional effort to make the
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
match if that if that's helpful yeah I
 
04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
mean I think that's I think that's
 
04:36:16.250 --> 04:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
helpful Nate but um you know
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
but but I I I I think losing them from
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
the Essa plan isn't in statute the Essa
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
plan is is is what was what the is
 
04:36:28.369 --> 04:36:28.379 align:start position:0%
developed by the department in
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
consultation with the um with the
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
oversight committee I think that was one
 
04:36:34.490 --> 04:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the things
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
um in the in the list uh but having them
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
in statute I think
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
I I think I I don't want to speak for
 
04:36:44.449 --> 04:36:44.459 align:start position:0%
Rick but I think you're
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're concern is that you you you you
 
04:36:48.529 --> 04:36:48.539 align:start position:0%
want them in
 
04:36:51.289 --> 04:36:51.299 align:start position:0%
having them in statute has some meaning
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
well I think we got to be accountable
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
not just to Essa but we got to be
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
accountable to as the legislative body
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
responsible for developing and
 
04:37:04.490 --> 04:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
identifying what an adequate education
 
04:37:04.500 --> 04:37:05.810 align:start position:0%
identifying what an adequate education
is

04:37:05.810 --> 04:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
we are responsible to the people of the
 
04:37:10.750 --> 04:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
state to provide that and these are the
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
indicators that we are delivering them
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a place where we can
 
04:37:18.170 --> 04:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
reference these indicators other than in
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
a federal application or plan for Essa
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
so somewhere there's this stuff's you
 
04:37:25.490 --> 04:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
know it took us years to put this
 
04:37:27.410 --> 04:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
together it used to be much shorter we
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
could probably make a list that's twice
 
04:37:31.010 --> 04:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
that length and indicator so I'm sure
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
but but you know I can just remember
 
04:37:35.209 --> 04:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
Mary Gile talking we got to have
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
something about expulsion and suspension
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's in there
 
04:37:39.000 --> 04:37:40.250 align:start position:0%
that's in there
um

04:37:40.250 --> 04:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
I I just I I I'd hate to see this
 
04:37:46.849 --> 04:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
disappear and I hate that then as a
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
state legislature to hand this over to
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education
 
04:37:54.529 --> 04:37:54.539 align:start position:0%
to make that decision based upon
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that you have to report to
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
the feds it seems to me that we should
 
04:38:01.730 --> 04:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
be able to do both
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
right and and if you know and I
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously there's a lot of Court
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
action right now and and the school
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
funding formula may change I'm sure
 
04:38:12.529 --> 04:38:12.539 align:start position:0%
we'll change again down the road but she
 
04:38:14.929 --> 04:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
may change totally yeah and and you know
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
we've you know we we
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
um sponsored a bill co-sponsored a bill
 
04:38:21.600 --> 04:38:22.369 align:start position:0%
um sponsored a bill co-sponsored a bill
um

04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
last year that took into consideration
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
attendance rates and and um number of or
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
percentage of graduating high school
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
students and things like that so being
 
04:38:33.769 --> 04:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
able to reference some statutory
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
language you know in a school funding
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
formula uh I I think has has
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
significant Merit because now the
 
04:38:44.570 --> 04:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
funding formulas require requiring those
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
metrics as well as the statute that
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're referencing
 
04:38:49.199 --> 04:38:52.010 align:start position:0%
they're referencing
um

04:38:52.010 --> 04:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.020 --> 04:38:54.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:38:54.490 --> 04:38:54.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:38:57.051 --> 04:38:57.061 align:start position:0%
I'm absolutely fine with building an
 
04:38:59.090 --> 04:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
actual State accountability arm of the
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
department but the legislature just
 
04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
really needs to realize that that's a
 
04:39:03.410 --> 04:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
commitment they need to make and have
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
people that are designated to do that
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
work for State purposes rather than just
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
for federal purposes and that's a
 
04:39:09.769 --> 04:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
separate conversation that we're not
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
we're trying to not have as part of this
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill but that's a real concern is we
 
04:39:17.449 --> 04:39:17.459 align:start position:0%
don't have designated people and staff
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
at the department to oversee State
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
accountability and state and ensure
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
schools are providing an adequate
 
04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
and see we we went that route too when
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
we were doing our assessments too we
 
04:39:33.769 --> 04:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
didn't have the people we didn't have
 
04:39:36.289 --> 04:39:36.299 align:start position:0%
the test for social studies so we bagged
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
that down to the local level
 
04:39:41.090 --> 04:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
you do it local
 
04:39:45.650 --> 04:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
um so it's I guess that I'm trying to
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
maintain program and it seems that we're
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've always designed our program around
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
the dollar that's available to support
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
program so it's not program budgeting
 
04:39:57.890 --> 04:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
we're just budgeting based upon a
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
limited dollar and I hate to see us then
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
start developing our policy or our
 
04:40:06.770 --> 04:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
statutes based upon limited dollar uh we
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
should have had we should set that bar
 
04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
where we want to set the bar and I agree
 
04:40:13.130 --> 04:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
we got to fund it if we want that
 
04:40:16.490 --> 04:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
information and that data but I I think
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
it'd be wrong to take this stuff out of
 
04:40:21.410 --> 04:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
law right now uh I think I think we make
 
04:40:23.390 --> 04:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
a dreadful mistake and maybe not pay for
 
04:40:24.770 --> 04:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
it now but maybe three or four years
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
down the road we would and then the
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
other thing too is there's some of the
 
04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
federal information that's in the law in
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
the state law but not all of it so
 
04:40:32.208 --> 04:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
there's probably needs to be more
 
04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive information in the state
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
law so the state law is not prescriptive
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
enough to really get to where we need it
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
to be so probably all of the state law
 
04:40:42.890 --> 04:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
really needs or all of the state plan
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be in law
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah some of this on the second page
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
talks about level one two three and four
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's fed stuff there but we use it we
 
04:40:56.448 --> 04:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
use it and to determine
 
04:40:58.430 --> 04:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
could it best be served in minimum
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
standards in the ad rules
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
resist serves as a guidance of all the
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
data collection
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
if it were in the Ed rules
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
which is sort of what you follow to make
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
sure your
 
04:41:14.750 --> 04:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
would that solve anything to to make it
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
in rules I I mean it it's I mean rules
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
are just as inflexible as a law I would
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
say actually as of lately I think the
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
law is let is more flexible than the
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
rules just given the process okay notice
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
the department collect this data right
 
04:41:30.360 --> 04:41:32.390 align:start position:0%
the department collect this data right
now

04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:35.810 --> 04:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
um the indicators uh we yeah we have a
 
04:41:38.090 --> 04:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
form and it's a Sasa number one two
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
three four five and we ask the schools
 
04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
how many of those indicators each
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.690 --> 04:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
so would you not be able to do that if
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
we left those left leaves in no oh we're
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
required to do it by the federal law so
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing it regardless
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
so then what is the additional money
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about if you're
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
doing it anyways we have nobody that's
 
04:42:05.930 --> 04:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
doing it for the state side of things so
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
realistically if you're going to have
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
two different systems two different
 
04:42:11.090 --> 04:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
accountability systems then there should
 
04:42:12.530 --> 04:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
be some people that are focusing on the
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
state stuff and some people that are
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
what are those superintendents say do
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
they have an opinion on that do you know
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
on I'm aware of those ones keeping this
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
in statute versus not well I mean the
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents have to do it regardless
 
04:42:31.128 --> 04:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
because they know they have to do it for
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
Essa so they don't care whether they
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say anything but I'm guessing
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
they don't care whether they have to do
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
it the difference from the state or the
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
federal they still have to do it yeah
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's not like the work
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
changes for them
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to resolve this mess
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
that this information
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
is needed I believe
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
and it says right here that Department
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
of Education shall development in a
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable schedule to collect the
 
04:43:04.810 --> 04:43:04.820 align:start position:0%
reporting of data required by the state
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
and federal law
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
now if we're going to take the state out
 
04:43:10.970 --> 04:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
of the business here
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
we might as well just let the feds tell
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
us how to do everything
 
04:43:17.208 --> 04:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
now I'm going kind of extreme there but
 
04:43:19.010 --> 04:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
you know I understand there's a lot of
 
04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
dollars come down from the feds and I
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
understand that what seventy percent of
 
04:43:25.610 --> 04:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
your staff over there are paid through
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
federal dollars I don't know what the
 
04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
percentage off my topic yeah
 
04:43:31.020 --> 04:43:32.510 align:start position:0%
percentage off my topic yeah
so

04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:32.520 --> 04:43:34.850 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:43:34.850 --> 04:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I I think that we can't just let the
 
04:43:39.770 --> 04:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education start
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
developing this stuff without having it
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature involved with it I mean
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you that Nate and I believe
 
04:43:49.250 --> 04:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
that there should be a strong State
 
04:43:51.650 --> 04:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
accountability system and you know we
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
would love to designate as many
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
resources to it as possible
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
um this is work the department should be
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing and would like to be doing and
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to implement the law the
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
best we possibly can given the resources
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
that we have to do it
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um but we have a lot of opinions on what
 
04:44:09.050 --> 04:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
we can we could be doing
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
um first and what we should be doing and
 
04:44:13.730 --> 04:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's there's better ways to do all of
 
04:44:13.740 --> 04:44:14.750 align:start position:0%
there's there's better ways to do all of
it

04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:44:17.628 --> 04:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
so if if we're collecting it anyways and
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
if it is virtually the same
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
would not the same reports can't work
 
04:44:27.770 --> 04:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
for both so my point right now yes today
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
we can do a two for one but the second
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's a slight change we can't do a
 
04:44:34.730 --> 04:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
two for one anymore and this kind of
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
thing is changing frequently I mean
 
04:44:38.930 --> 04:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
there very well could be so if this bill
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
isn't going to pass a right now and it
 
04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
goes then we start doing something again
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
next fall or whatever or a year out and
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
we might have changes and we might need
 
04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
to do different different systems and
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to avoid
 
04:44:52.850 --> 04:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
without because we don't have adequate
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
resources to run multiple systems
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and you're talking about
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
changes in the in the federal rules for
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
the plan or the or the state or the
 
04:45:05.448 --> 04:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
state plan so I I think because what a
 
04:45:07.250 --> 04:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
good one is is we've had a lot of
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
conversations about we should go back to
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
the field and work with the field and
 
04:45:11.330 --> 04:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
look at the college career I need this
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
indicator list which is that list that
 
04:45:14.690 --> 04:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad just brought up
 
04:45:16.010 --> 04:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of you know
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
superintendents have brought to us and
 
04:45:18.410 --> 04:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
said oh well what about this or why
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
isn't this on the list and we agree the
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
list was put together in 2015 and it
 
04:45:24.350 --> 04:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
probably could be looked at since we're
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
almost eight years down the road on that
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
um but uh so if that were to happen we
 
04:45:32.448 --> 04:45:32.458 align:start position:0%
would work with stakeholders to
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
potentially change that list we would
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
get approval from the U.S Department of
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
Education we would modify our data
 
04:45:38.930 --> 04:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
collection but now we'll have the state
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
plan or the state law that requires us
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
to collect the old list and then the
 
04:45:43.850 --> 04:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
federal collecting the new list so we'll
 
04:45:45.410 --> 04:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
have two separate data collections that
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
are required to be done by the school
 
04:45:48.830 --> 04:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
districts and then we'll need kind of
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
people to monitor both of those separate
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
data Collections and then two different
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
designations we know we're going to be
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing a CSI designation for the federal
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
level based on a federalist and a CSI
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
designation on the state level but date
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
so you know one concrete example is this
 
04:46:12.890 --> 04:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
past legislative cycle there was
 
04:46:14.448 --> 04:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
requirements added in around the FAFSA
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh where schools now have to make sure
 
04:46:18.650 --> 04:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
that students are filling out the FAFSA
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the last data point out here letter
 
04:46:23.390 --> 04:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
O under that list of data indicators is
 
04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
the number of percentage of graduating
 
04:46:26.448 --> 04:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
high school students provided in-person
 
04:46:29.208 --> 04:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
assistance in completing the FAFSA so
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
those were all new requirements added to
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
State Statute but when you look at the
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
accountability plan under the pbas pbas
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't include that language because we
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
pull that from our state as a plan so
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's an instance right now where
 
04:46:43.970 --> 04:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's one data requirement in the
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
state plan tied to adequate education
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
but our accountability system is the CSI
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
school system which does not include
 
04:46:52.850 --> 04:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
that data requirement so each time one
 
04:46:55.250 --> 04:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
of these areas changes either we have to
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
go and change the back end of it or we
 
04:46:59.930 --> 04:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
have to somehow make the two systems
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
comply with each other
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's where the
 
04:47:05.090 --> 04:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
implementation side of it gets difficult
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the Department because
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
it there there's two systems essentially
 
04:47:13.010 --> 04:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
the state and federal system and it's to
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn's point I think the more one
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
changes versus the other one the more
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be running to
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
simultaneous but different systems and
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have multiple sets of
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
staff to do those
 
04:47:27.770 --> 04:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
right right but but you know again you
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
know the um
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
you know the federal accountability is
 
04:47:34.010 --> 04:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
you know there there's about what 200
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars that comes along from
 
04:47:37.850 --> 04:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
um to put that in context a billion
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
dollars from the state of New Hampshire
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
and two billion dollars from local
 
04:47:45.170 --> 04:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers so I think the state
 
04:47:45.180 --> 04:47:46.550 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers so I think the state
accountability

04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:47:50.208 --> 04:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
part is really assuring
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
um that that our own taxpayers money is
 
04:47:57.170 --> 04:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
being used in a way that's um that's you
 
04:48:00.650 --> 04:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
know yielding good results and and and I
 
04:48:02.930 --> 04:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
think our school funding formula uh
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully is migrating in a direction I
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
think we made some very strong changes
 
04:48:09.288 --> 04:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
to it um this year in the the house
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
budget Senate doesn't mess around with
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
it well we're going to make sure of that
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
and uh and that that that moves Us in
 
04:48:21.050 --> 04:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
that direction uh as well but um but in
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
order to to to be able to do that we're
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to need to make sure that we're uh
 
04:48:29.930 --> 04:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
collecting the information we need to uh
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
to not just not just be accountable to
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
the lowest performing you know schools
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
but to all schools
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
um you know across the state so so you
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
know that that sort of uh where are we
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
at the five percent cut or the 7 percent
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
cut or whatever it was the other um
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
Monday when we were talking about this
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't think that cuts it
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
for the um you know for the state and um
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
and so I I'd be I'd be very
 
04:49:06.550 --> 04:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
04:49:09.288 --> 04:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe not all of this
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
needs to remain in statute but maybe a
 
04:49:13.850 --> 04:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
lot of it does
 
04:49:15.890 --> 04:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
I mean a lot of it is it's it's
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
information it's gives us feedback
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
for example like the concurrent dual
 
04:49:23.090 --> 04:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
enrollment indicator where we want to
 
04:49:24.590 --> 04:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
know the number of kids that passed at
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
least one course concurrent dual
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
enrollment now I know that may be
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to attain senior we're now
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
working with the Community College
 
04:49:34.368 --> 04:49:34.378 align:start position:0%
pretty closely on that the another
 
04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
indicator right down here where you know
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
the number of kids that are completing
 
04:49:40.610 --> 04:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh International Baccalaureate program
 
04:49:43.010 --> 04:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
or a AP course
 
04:49:43.020 --> 04:49:44.810 align:start position:0%
or a AP course
so

04:49:44.810 --> 04:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.770 --> 04:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
department when we work with the
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2017 to tie the two
 
04:49:55.368 --> 04:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
together was so we had the same system
 
04:49:57.890 --> 04:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
for both I don't think it makes sense to
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
have two very slim similar but slightly
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
different systems they should be exactly
 
04:50:04.128 --> 04:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
the same or we should have just a state
 
04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
accountability system and maybe the
 
04:50:07.730 --> 04:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
decision of this committee is that we
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
should go in and say what is important
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of State accountability
 
04:50:12.650 --> 04:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
and actually design a state
 
04:50:15.410 --> 04:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
accountability system that is not just a
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
shadow system of the February honest
 
04:50:20.208 --> 04:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
with you Caitlyn when I looked at that
 
04:50:24.170 --> 04:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 my intent was to get
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
information back which would let me know
 
04:50:29.930 --> 04:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
whether we are delivering this adequate
 
04:50:29.940 --> 04:50:31.610 align:start position:0%
whether we are delivering this adequate
education

04:50:31.610 --> 04:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:50:31.620 --> 04:50:33.050 align:start position:0%
education
I

04:50:33.050 --> 04:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:50:35.570 --> 04:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
my I had less intent and I probably
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have any intent regarding the the
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
Essa stuff the stuff that goes to the
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
feds I was more concerned that we are
 
04:50:46.368 --> 04:50:46.378 align:start position:0%
getting back some measure that says that
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're providing that opportunity
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education I think if we
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
take these indicators out we're going to
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:50:57.650 --> 04:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know where I'll end up it's all
 
04:50:59.208 --> 04:50:59.218 align:start position:0%
going to be an Essa plan nobody's ever
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to see it
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that we just want to
 
04:51:03.170 --> 04:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
remember too the only thing we're
 
04:51:04.970 --> 04:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
talking about here is a College and
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
Career Readiness indicators for seniors
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
in high school we're not talking about
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're not talking about uh
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive accountability system so
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
we should talk about what it means for
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
all grades and accountability looks like
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
for all things it was underneath
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
adequacy underneath the topic delivery
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education
 
04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
to me that says yes career Readiness is
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that came out of the
 
04:51:33.530 --> 04:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
era back then 2015-17
 
04:51:35.930 --> 04:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
started with Ross cattell pumping that
 
04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
stuff and then here we are now uh uh I I
 
04:51:43.730 --> 04:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
I I just you know I'm fearful that if we
 
04:51:47.208 --> 04:51:47.218 align:start position:0%
don't do maintain some of this uh does
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
the the federal program want to know the
 
04:51:50.208 --> 04:51:50.218 align:start position:0%
number of kids go off the military
 
04:51:50.218 --> 04:51:51.948 align:start position:0%
number of kids go off the military
experience

04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:51:53.810 --> 04:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
the mirror of the federal program right
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
now this all these things in here are
 
04:51:58.010 --> 04:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
weird when we wrote this bill in 2017 we
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
copied and pasted the federal plan into
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
this so you get the information right so
 
04:52:04.368 --> 04:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
why are we taking out a statute because
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
what we what we didn't want is visit is
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
what's in the plan to be slightly
 
04:52:10.610 --> 04:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
different from the state that's that's
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
the only reason why we didn't want there
 
04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
to be too too slightly different lists
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
one a federalist and one estate list we
 
04:52:19.850 --> 04:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a difference right now no
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.208 --> 04:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
no no we would ideally we would never
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
rewrite it again and it would just
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be a system that's
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the field
 
04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
um we did make some indentments and
 
04:52:37.610 --> 04:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
changes to it over the past two years as
 
04:52:39.230 --> 04:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
a result of the pandemic
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
um because there was one year where we
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
didn't run the state assessment there
 
04:52:43.250 --> 04:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
was one year where we ran the assessment
 
04:52:45.410 --> 04:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
but there was limited accountability but
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
those were addendums based upon the
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the pandemic outside of
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
that we we have the discretion as a
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
state to determine when we want to
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
rewrite that plan
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
and then the funding is tied to that
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
right through American Rescue and
 
04:53:02.570 --> 04:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
Recovery Act whatever do you know if
 
04:53:05.448 --> 04:53:05.458 align:start position:0%
there's a Sunset date for that
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know about the recovery funds
 
04:53:09.770 --> 04:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
specifically but all title funds are
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
tied to that Essa plan so schools
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
receiving one two three four through
 
04:53:17.208 --> 04:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
Title IX all those funds are tied to us
 
04:53:18.770 --> 04:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
fulfilling our obligations of the state
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:27.288 --> 04:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
but I would think we would want to have
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
the state be the one who takes
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
precedence and any new statutes that we
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
pass be the ones that that the plan be
 
04:53:38.570 --> 04:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
changed based on our statutes not our
 
04:53:41.770 --> 04:53:41.780 align:start position:0%
statutes based on the plan
 
04:53:41.780 --> 04:53:43.490 align:start position:0%
statutes based on the plan
that

04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:43.500 --> 04:53:44.230 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:46.610 --> 04:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
might not be allowable because there
 
04:53:48.050 --> 04:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
might be a federal statute that would
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
change that would require our plan to
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
change so we would have to change our
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
federal plan based on any federal law
 
04:53:55.730 --> 04:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
even if it were to conflict in the state
 
04:53:57.288 --> 04:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
law I would consuming assuming we would
 
04:53:58.730 --> 04:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
want to continue to participate in the
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
federal programs
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so I know Caitlin has talked a
 
04:54:08.810 --> 04:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
little bit about resources so the bureau
 
04:54:09.890 --> 04:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
that I've receive is the Bureau of
 
04:54:12.050 --> 04:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
assessment and accountability in terms
 
04:54:13.850 --> 04:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
of positions I have one person in that
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
Bureau that does accountability so that
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
person's job is to oversee the Essa
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
Federal plan that we have for CSI TSI
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
and ATS schools and that's part of why
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
we mirrored the state accountability
 
04:54:29.448 --> 04:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
with the state Essa plan because we have
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
one staff member of the department that
 
04:54:33.170 --> 04:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
must oversee both
 
04:54:36.050 --> 04:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so we don't want to have two
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
different competing systems that have to
 
04:54:42.770 --> 04:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.780 --> 04:54:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:54:52.030 --> 04:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:55.810 --> 04:54:55.820 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill that's an HP too
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
a data analyst alone is not required is
 
04:55:02.690 --> 04:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
not necessary so I'm just saying yeah so
 
04:55:03.890 --> 04:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
let me kind of I can talk about the
 
04:55:04.850 --> 04:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
people that are paid by the federal
 
04:55:06.288 --> 04:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
funding to do some of this work so we
 
04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
have um several staffers that do the
 
04:55:09.770 --> 04:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
data collection side of things and
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're known as i4c help desk folk and
 
04:55:14.690 --> 04:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
and they are on the phone 24 7 with
 
04:55:17.810 --> 04:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
schools collecting data and whatnot we
 
04:55:19.490 --> 04:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
then have data
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
um or data warehouse Architects that
 
04:55:24.410 --> 04:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
warehouse all the data do all the
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
matching do the different do all the
 
04:55:28.368 --> 04:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
different calculations we then have a
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
contractor which are hoping to have a
 
04:55:31.490 --> 04:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
position to replace the contractor
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
should considerability in cell that does
 
04:55:34.970 --> 04:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
all of the calculations is in charge of
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
all the business rules actually sorry
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
two contractors that do that work and
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
then we have at least one internal
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
position that oversees the reporting
 
04:55:46.250 --> 04:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
side of things we then have another
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
contractor that that all this is all
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
paid by federal funding that oversees
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
all of the federal report cards that are
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
required to be put out where we put all
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
of this data out
 
04:55:57.770 --> 04:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
a couple but we're talking about quite a
 
04:56:01.610 --> 04:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
bit of Staff resources are paid by
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
we don't need to fix it today I was just
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to say we don't need to fix it
 
04:56:16.560 --> 04:56:17.448 align:start position:0%
going to say we don't need to fix it
today

04:56:17.448 --> 04:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:56:19.490 --> 04:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and if this stays in the law it's not
 
04:56:21.288 --> 04:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
going to be the end-all be-all you can
 
04:56:23.330 --> 04:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
put it back in it's just a little bit
 
04:56:25.490 --> 04:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
messy and we have potential issues by
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
going forward by leaving it this way if
 
04:56:28.850 --> 04:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
there are changes
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
um because the department will probably
 
04:56:32.090 --> 04:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
begin to work with the field about
 
04:56:33.410 --> 04:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
changing the College and Career
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicators at a minimum going
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
forward and potentially some other CSI
 
04:56:41.330 --> 04:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
School designations but they're there
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
probably should be somebody some more
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
staff at the department focused on state
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
accountability I I don't know that
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
most people would disagree with that
 
04:56:52.850 --> 04:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
statement if it's an important
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
work that the Department's doing how
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
many people you're talking about
 
04:56:58.128 --> 04:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out what to say if
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
we were to have a state accountability
 
04:57:00.530 --> 04:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
system that looks different than a
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
federal we would have to see what that
 
04:57:03.050 --> 04:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
system looks like
 
04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
and what's your average cost person 140
 
04:57:12.530 --> 04:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
you'd have to add access access
 
04:57:19.010 --> 04:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
for Ells as well in the list
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
I added my notes we talked about CNS
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
Readiness um yeah CNC Readiness and
 
04:57:24.718 --> 04:57:25.730 align:start position:0%
Readiness um yeah CNC Readiness and
access

04:57:25.730 --> 04:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
for ell was it your intent to add that
 
04:57:29.770 --> 04:57:29.780 align:start position:0%
to that list
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
or just my notes what page are you
 
04:57:35.570 --> 04:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
looking at uh on the same delivery of an
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
adequate education is still on the list
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that is that is a part of the federal
 
04:57:43.610 --> 04:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
accountability system it is in there
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah when when we look at this
 
04:57:46.730 --> 04:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
particular list here this is relative to
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
just the College and Career ready data
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
so the CCR indicator but the Essa plan
 
04:57:53.810 --> 04:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
is much more Broad and there's several
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
sections in there that refer to access
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
testing and English language proficiency
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is part of the larger system
 
04:58:05.448 --> 04:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
so we have to have as a minimum what the
 
04:58:05.458 --> 04:58:06.410 align:start position:0%
so we have to have as a minimum what the
Federal

04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
04:58:10.128 --> 04:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
guidelines are if we want the money but
 
04:58:11.810 --> 04:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
we could add
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
over above that if we want more but if
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
we had this other person would they be
 
04:58:19.310 --> 04:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
able to own with
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
could they use all of the federal stuff
 
04:58:23.448 --> 04:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
that we have and just look at whatever
 
04:58:27.610 --> 04:58:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.690 --> 04:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard to talk about a
 
04:58:31.128 --> 04:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
theoretical accountability system
 
04:58:32.690 --> 04:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
without saying what it may or may not
 
04:58:36.170 --> 04:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
look like but potentially
 
04:58:39.650 --> 04:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I anytime there's duplication we try
 
04:58:41.330 --> 04:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
to be as efficient as possible with
 
04:58:41.340 --> 04:58:42.708 align:start position:0%
to be as efficient as possible with
duplication

04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
duplication
 
04:58:44.330 --> 04:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and duplicative efforts to collect
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
data and whatnot we we've we've even
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
tried to do it two for one when we were
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
talking about cynics we said oh should
 
04:58:52.610 --> 04:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh Civics be a college degree Readiness
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
indicator because we're just literally
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do a two for one with that one
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
um but that's just not you know what
 
04:59:02.690 --> 04:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
we're doing so
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
I think we could go round and round for
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
a long time since we have on this I just
 
04:59:09.708 --> 04:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if there is no need
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
to update the asset plan or you don't
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
foresee it because it's been approved
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we wait and see moving forward I
 
04:59:20.090 --> 04:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
mean maybe in six months they'll be I
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
just do I think I know what you're
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
trying to do and it makes sense yeah I I
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
think the thing coordinate does we
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
probably didn't put enough of the slang
 
04:59:27.958 --> 04:59:28.970 align:start position:0%
probably didn't put enough of the slang
like

04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:59:30.830 --> 04:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's not enough of the Essa language
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's in the state law that you could
 
04:59:33.948 --> 04:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
do it without reading the plan so
 
04:59:34.930 --> 04:59:34.940 align:start position:0%
there's probably
 
04:59:37.368 --> 04:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
more information that needs to be added
 
04:59:38.930 --> 04:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
in the state law to actually be able to
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
implement it if you wanted to be able to
 
04:59:42.890 --> 04:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
do it independently of the federal plan
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
so it was we yeah it was just too short
 
04:59:46.560 --> 04:59:50.330 align:start position:0%
so it was we yeah it was just too short
essentially

04:59:50.330 --> 04:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.208 --> 04:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
on this uh sheet going beyond the
 
04:59:56.810 --> 04:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
indicators that uh Jen's provided us uh
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that portions which deal
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
with performance-based accountability
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
system and then performance-based School
 
05:00:04.610 --> 05:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
accountability system verification
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
process all that's been left out
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
which one would be G1 well I'll look at
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
page nine the last page
 
05:00:16.550 --> 05:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall work with school
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
officials and faculty from selected
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
schools to implement the performance
 
05:00:23.208 --> 05:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
Space School accountability program and
 
05:00:25.010 --> 05:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
to develop a data collection system
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
which will allow schools to easily
 
05:00:29.090 --> 05:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
report results to the department for
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
analysis and Reporting it's all the
 
05:00:35.448 --> 05:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the commissioner
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
well I I think that this language is
 
05:00:41.090 --> 05:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
written prior to
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
the existence of I think this was the
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
enabling language that allowed the
 
05:00:46.670 --> 05:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
department to collect the data
 
05:00:49.490 --> 05:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
collection or to to establish the data
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
collection systems that we have right
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
now and so we didn't feel like this was
 
05:00:54.410 --> 05:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
necessary because we already have those
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
systems in place so the the
 
05:01:01.368 --> 05:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
uh we already have those I I mean if you
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
want to put it back in there what
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
happens if we change and we do something
 
05:01:04.560 --> 05:01:05.810 align:start position:0%
happens if we change and we do something
different

05:01:05.810 --> 05:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:01:05.820 --> 05:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
different
um

05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
would we have to reference back to this
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
to say what the commissioner
 
05:01:13.810 --> 05:01:13.820 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
for future purposes if we're not using
 
05:01:19.610 --> 05:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
it right now maybe we will in the future
 
05:01:20.930 --> 05:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
I've been looking last time we
 
05:01:25.730 --> 05:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.010 --> 05:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
so most of the system
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of hate to keep saying it
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
but that the performance-based school
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
accountability system the pbas system is
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
all detailed really extensively in that
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
state plan and so that's why some of
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
these sections were pulled out because
 
05:01:42.170 --> 05:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
much of that is in the plan itself so
 
05:01:44.330 --> 05:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
when we when you look at the bill as
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
proposed now the pbas system identifies
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
CSI TSI and ATS schools as being those
 
05:01:52.368 --> 05:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
underperforming schools that are not
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the criteria for
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
inadequate education but the process by
 
05:01:59.570 --> 05:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
which those schools are identified is
 
05:02:01.970 --> 05:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
all detailed out in the state asset plan
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
and the current sections of Statute here
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
are more vague than the specifics that
 
05:02:11.090 --> 05:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
are actually in the state Essa plan so I
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
can understand the concern of well it
 
05:02:13.610 --> 05:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
looks like we're pulling that section
 
05:02:15.170 --> 05:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
out and we're not replacing it with
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
anything but what's actually happening
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
is we're taking those sections out
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
because the really detailed language of
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
what the system looks like what the
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
checks and balances are what the data
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
collection is is all in that state Essa
 
05:02:28.010 --> 05:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
plan which is you know really it's about
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
a hundred plus pages of you know the
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
actual process the department follows
 
05:02:34.970 --> 05:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
for identifying those underperforming
 
05:02:34.980 --> 05:02:36.110 align:start position:0%
for identifying those underperforming
schools

05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
so they're sort of almost like two
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
branches that I feel like we could go
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
here a little bit is you know what we've
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
tried to do is take out a lot of the
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
vagueness in current statute and
 
05:02:49.250 --> 05:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
reference CSI TSI and ATS schools is the
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
ones that are the schools that aren't
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
meeting you know all of those Benchmark
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
targets that we've set in our plan
 
05:02:56.448 --> 05:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
the other thing we could do is if we
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
want that level of specificity in the
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
law we almost have to take what's in our
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
current asset plan and put that into the
 
05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
law but again you're talking about over
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
100 pages of really detailed out you
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
know accountability system and programs
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are in that plan
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
and that's where we get a little bit
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
hesitant because if you detail them in
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
both places anytime one changes the
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
other one does so it's kind of those are
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
the two paths I I think from an
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
implementation perspective you know when
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
we look at okay how do we go to our
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
staff how does the department work with
 
05:03:32.330 --> 05:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
the field to make sure they understand
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
what is the accountability system we
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're all talking
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
about the same accountability system
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
and we can detail that anywhere we can
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
detail that in State Statute we can
 
05:03:44.690 --> 05:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
detail that in the asset plan and I
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of up to this body to
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
determine we just don't end up in a
 
05:03:50.448 --> 05:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
situation where we have competing
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
accountability systems existing in both
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then trying to explain that to the
 
05:03:55.200 --> 05:04:00.470 align:start position:0%
and then trying to explain that to the
field

05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.570 --> 05:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
this works I thought
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state came up with State Statute
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
which was kind of more General
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
the department and whatever rules get
 
05:04:16.128 --> 05:04:16.138 align:start position:0%
developed about how to implement the
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
state statute and so your plan would
 
05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
have to follow State Statute so taking
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
State Statute out
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
then you no longer have the authority to
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
even do your plan do you I mean doesn't
 
05:04:34.490 --> 05:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
the statute have to stay there so that
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
you can do your plan and that's what so
 
05:04:39.650 --> 05:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
the there are still the sections of the
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
in this bill that's being proposed so
 
05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's not being removed what we've done
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
is we've cleaned it up and the language
 
05:04:49.690 --> 05:04:49.700 align:start position:0%
that is now being proposed in this bill
 
05:04:51.650 --> 05:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
references the performance-based
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
accountability system and it's so our
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
state statute says schools must follow
 
05:04:56.930 --> 05:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
the performance-based accountability
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
system which is in the state Essa plan
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
and we've defined both of those things
 
05:05:03.288 --> 05:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
in statute so then when a school looks
 
05:05:04.970 --> 05:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
at that they go oh I'm required by New
 
05:05:07.010 --> 05:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Statute to follow pbas
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
pbas is in the state asset plan and so
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
you pull that state asset plan up and
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's your 120 pages of school
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
accountability that they have to do we
 
05:05:17.810 --> 05:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
have to do it regardless because it's a
 
05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
federal requirement so no matter what
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
the state statute says we're going to do
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
the state as a plan what we try to do is
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the state statute
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
said because we're doing accountability
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
and because the department and schools
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
already have to do the state as a plan
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
let's mirror our state and federal
 
05:05:36.050 --> 05:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
accountability and when we wrote the
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
state plan we took all the indicators
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
from State Statute and put that in there
 
05:05:41.690 --> 05:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
so this list of data that includes
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
things like CTE indicators suspension
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
and expulsion data attendance rates
 
05:05:48.170 --> 05:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's all in the state's plan
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
and now the statute just says schools
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
and Department you have to do the state
 
05:05:52.260 --> 05:05:54.590 align:start position:0%
and Department you have to do the state
plan

05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
if so so the authority is there it's
 
05:06:00.288 --> 05:06:00.298 align:start position:0%
just not spelled out in detail the
 
05:06:03.050 --> 05:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
system in both places
 
05:06:07.490 --> 05:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.500 --> 05:06:08.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah so

05:06:08.890 --> 05:06:08.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
the Essa plan is I remember we went
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
through it piece by piece and voted on
 
05:06:16.610 --> 05:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
it and I just noticed I was trying to
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
find it and I just noticed that there's
 
05:06:21.770 --> 05:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
modifications that have been requested
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
um on the asset plan and yet that hasn't
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
come through the legislature as far as I
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
know is that is that
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
not what's supposed to happen or why why
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
is that happening as well
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I believe those are the the addendum
 
05:06:42.770 --> 05:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
requests that we had made as a result of
 
05:06:45.288 --> 05:06:45.298 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic um those are the most
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
recent changes that we would have made
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
to the plan
 
05:06:50.930 --> 05:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and those we had to make because the
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
state plan is based off of three years
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
worth of data and because we didn't run
 
05:06:58.010 --> 05:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
the state assessment system during that
 
05:06:59.330 --> 05:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
first year of the pandemic and then we
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
had limited data the second year we
 
05:07:03.050 --> 05:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
didn't have three years worth of data to
 
05:07:05.448 --> 05:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
hold schools accountable to so we had
 
05:07:07.970 --> 05:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
applied for some limited changes to the
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
state plan with the feds so that we
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
weren't held accountable to three years
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
of data when we didn't have three years
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
worth of data it was uh I believe it had
 
05:07:19.250 --> 05:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
been put out for public comment at the
 
05:07:21.288 --> 05:07:21.298 align:start position:0%
time when it was submitted and we had to
 
05:07:22.850 --> 05:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
have a approval through the governor's
 
05:07:24.410 --> 05:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
office as well so I know it was vetted
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office it never
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
came through the legislative branch
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
which seems like if we're the ones that
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
are doing the
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
statutes for Education should come
 
05:07:39.890 --> 05:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it seem that way
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely and especially if the um the
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
the data that you're collecting is
 
05:07:52.250 --> 05:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
conditioned on by what's listed in the
 
05:07:55.150 --> 05:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
plan if changes can be made to the plan
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
unilaterally or without legislative
 
05:07:59.448 --> 05:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
oversight then what do we know what what
 
05:08:01.850 --> 05:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
we're losing or what what we no longer
 
05:08:04.368 --> 05:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
have have access to
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I will say we didn't change
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
the system at all we just requested an
 
05:08:11.690 --> 05:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
ability to push the system the timeline
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the system forward by two years right
 
05:08:16.368 --> 05:08:16.378 align:start position:0%
right no I appreciate that but I think I
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
think what what representative Tanner's
 
05:08:20.690 --> 05:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
concern is is that is that changes could
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
be made without without legislative
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
involvement and and there's you know
 
05:08:27.530 --> 05:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
what certainly one of the things I think
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
we learned in the school funding
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
commission was the importance of of
 
05:08:36.530 --> 05:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
um you know years of of data that has
 
05:08:38.570 --> 05:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
been consistently collected because then
 
05:08:41.208 --> 05:08:41.218 align:start position:0%
you can really look at Trends and and
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
and you know and develop
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
um you know different
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
um you know mechanisms for um for
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
funding and accountability and if you've
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
got you know you know breaks in that
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
data because something's no longer being
 
05:08:57.050 --> 05:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
collected because the Essa plan has has
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
changed then um then you know then some
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
of that data may may no longer be
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
relevant for um uh for future news uh so
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know want to want to sort of tread
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
carefully on what it is we'd be losing
 
05:09:15.650 --> 05:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
by taking taking some of these or taking
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
all these out or taking some of them out
 
05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
and know exactly what um what
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature might want to continue
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
to collect for current and future you
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
know State accountability I think
 
05:09:33.170 --> 05:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn I think you you laid out the
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
right question is what do we want to
 
05:09:37.128 --> 05:09:37.138 align:start position:0%
really be doing here having a state
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
accountability plan and a federal
 
05:09:43.250 --> 05:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
accountability plan or one plan or both
 
05:09:47.090 --> 05:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
plans or you know or what is it yeah and
 
05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
I think that you know when we did this
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
in 2018 I didn't see that was 2018 since
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
that I think the intent was to tie the
 
05:09:54.410 --> 05:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
two together and it sounds like
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
potentially that was maybe a mistake but
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
if if that's what we're saying that if
 
05:10:00.890 --> 05:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
we want to run two separate systems it
 
05:10:02.570 --> 05:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
was a mistake for the department at the
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I'm not saying it was a
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
mistake to tie
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
um time together back then it probably
 
05:10:15.890 --> 05:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
got us off to a good start on um uh on
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
that but but
 
05:10:20.448 --> 05:10:20.458 align:start position:0%
yeah but you know I don't necessarily
 
05:10:24.010 --> 05:10:24.020 align:start position:0%
think that that state accountability
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
should absolutely follow Federal
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
accountability because I think you know
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're sort of being accountable for
 
05:10:33.530 --> 05:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
different things and um and staying
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
accountability is a lot greater I mean
 
05:10:37.250 --> 05:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a lot more dollars
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
involved at the state local level than
 
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
there are at the federal level and um uh
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
and then you know as as Rick mentioned
 
05:10:47.090 --> 05:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
right at the top we may want to use some
 
05:10:49.490 --> 05:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
of this data for other other purposes
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
too whether that's at the um at K-12 or
 
05:10:53.878 --> 05:10:54.830 align:start position:0%
too whether that's at the um at K-12 or
at

05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
um you know programs with the community
 
05:10:59.570 --> 05:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
college system
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like we're fighting that
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
tell them yeah yeah
 
05:11:14.770 --> 05:11:14.780 align:start position:0%
look where we are yeah
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
kind of describe where we're at some of
 
05:11:17.400 --> 05:11:18.368 align:start position:0%
kind of describe where we're at some of
those

05:11:18.368 --> 05:11:18.378 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to ask one question go
 
05:11:23.090 --> 05:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
ahead Oliver
 
05:11:25.310 --> 05:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
part of the problem for someone like me
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
who's not been in this system at all is
 
05:11:32.090 --> 05:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out to whom do I go to
 
05:11:35.330 --> 05:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
find the answer to my question and it
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me that much of what we're
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
looking and talking about would be
 
05:11:46.690 --> 05:11:46.700 align:start position:0%
made easier to think if we had an index
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
of some sort that tells me that you used
 
05:11:52.128 --> 05:11:52.138 align:start position:0%
to keep this money over here but now
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's kept over there but part of it is
 
05:11:56.810 --> 05:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
sent off to somebody else and there's no
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
road map to find out what happened so
 
05:12:01.730 --> 05:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
how do we have what I call
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
accountability which is an ultimate
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
accounting and this system calls
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
accountability well we have a process
 
05:12:11.570 --> 05:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that the is the end
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
point in the process and so it's very
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
hard to follow not having participated
 
05:12:22.730 --> 05:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
with you in this exactly
 
05:12:25.550 --> 05:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
what went where and why and what was
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
this been for and what was the result
 
05:12:30.530 --> 05:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
and how all that gets together and
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about well we sent that
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
to these people we sent that to those
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
people they can tell you what happened
 
05:12:38.810 --> 05:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
to it but
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
without asking you if the two of you
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
retired we'd have to shut down the state
 
05:12:43.920 --> 05:12:45.550 align:start position:0%
retired we'd have to shut down the state
government

05:12:45.550 --> 05:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
thanks not proposing an easy out
 
05:12:55.610 --> 05:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless you you can't buy
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
dilemma but I do I and we've had similar
 
05:13:00.170 --> 05:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
conversations I think with community
 
05:13:02.208 --> 05:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
members with parents with you know
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents and principals and
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
what's the best way of communicating out
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
all the data that the department does
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
collect I think one thing that's
 
05:13:10.610 --> 05:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
important to understand is this is a
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
relatively short list of data indicators
 
05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here it's a through
 
05:13:14.940 --> 05:13:16.490 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here it's a through
o

05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
o
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
um if you go into the I report system we
 
05:13:21.288 --> 05:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
publish a report card annually for every
 
05:13:22.730 --> 05:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
school and every District that probably
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
has over a hundred different pieces of
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
data related to each of those individual
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
schools and districts so it's a it's a
 
05:13:31.970 --> 05:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
snapshot here and I think when we talk
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
about building accountability systems if
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about really looking at
 
05:13:37.550 --> 05:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
it from start to finish you have to
 
05:13:39.170 --> 05:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
figure out what is it that we want want
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
to hold people accountable too you know
 
05:13:42.530 --> 05:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
most most of this data we're talking
 
05:13:43.730 --> 05:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
about here is really high school level
 
05:13:46.610 --> 05:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
data but we're reporting on on data that
 
05:13:48.530 --> 05:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
includes things like the number of
 
05:13:50.090 --> 05:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
classes and percentages of students
 
05:13:52.010 --> 05:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
being taught by early career teachers
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
versus experienced teachers versus
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
teachers that are teaching outside of
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
their subject area all the different
 
05:13:58.970 --> 05:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
percentages and breakdowns of all
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
different subgroups of students and
 
05:14:03.890 --> 05:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
their educational progress through K-12
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
so there's a huge amount of data that
 
05:14:07.730 --> 05:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
the department collects presents and
 
05:14:09.770 --> 05:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
reports out on on those school and
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
district report cards and part of that
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
is the accountability system right one
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
one is public transparency of having all
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
that data but the other part is you know
 
05:14:20.448 --> 05:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
what are the sections that we're going
 
05:14:22.910 --> 05:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
to say these are the the core tenants
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna you know have schools
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
report on that is tied to an
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
accountability system where we say okay
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
what are the schools that are that are
 
05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
underperforming where are the schools
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that need the most assistance how can we
 
05:14:34.368 --> 05:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
better direct things like state and
 
05:14:36.530 --> 05:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
federal dollars toward the schools to
 
05:14:37.850 --> 05:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
bring them up to where we want the
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
performance of the schools and students
 
05:14:41.330 --> 05:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
to be so I think there's some larger
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
questions here obviously about systems
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
but there's there's far more data that
 
05:14:46.970 --> 05:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
we collect and publish and put out there
 
05:14:48.770 --> 05:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
than I think is just what's included on
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.410 --> 05:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
well I I I get that too you know I just
 
05:14:56.330 --> 05:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
when I called the summer okay on asking
 
05:14:59.810 --> 05:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
you how many kids uh have IEPs requiring
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent of the time less
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
than 80 percent of Time how many are in
 
05:15:06.368 --> 05:15:06.378 align:start position:0%
uh Hospital situations or you know
 
05:15:09.170 --> 05:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
residential placements and you had that
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
information for me very very quickly
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so I I understand that I however I
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm conflicted in this right here from
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
the standpoint I feel that this
 
05:15:24.288 --> 05:15:24.298 align:start position:0%
information's important that we get this
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
from our schools from a state
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
perspective there's some state issues
 
05:15:30.230 --> 05:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
here which I'm sure may not be Federal
 
05:15:30.240 --> 05:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
here which I'm sure may not be Federal
issues

05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:15:34.128 --> 05:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
um for example when we want to know how
 
05:15:35.690 --> 05:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
many uh schools had their Emergency
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
Management plans in right and we found
 
05:15:41.330 --> 05:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
out 20 percent
 
05:15:41.340 --> 05:15:41.930 align:start position:0%
out 20 percent
um

05:15:41.930 --> 05:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
um then we had a hammer on them we got a
 
05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
little bit more when we had the teacher
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh shortage committee here wanting to
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
know how many superintendents have
 
05:15:53.810 --> 05:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
forwarded their numbers in and and Steve
 
05:15:57.890 --> 05:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
says yeah maybe 46 I got as high as 56
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
the other day he said so I I know you
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
have to chase people to get this
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
information I know you are are
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with it but I I'm just a
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
little contrary to trying to not include
 
05:16:16.930 --> 05:16:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:18.970 --> 05:16:18.980 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
and and Rick I think it it raises a um
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
you know you know based on you know some
 
05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the some of the comments that Nate
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
and Caitlin have made
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
um you know erases the question you know
 
05:16:34.010 --> 05:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
when we when we take a look at this and
 
05:16:35.810 --> 05:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
what sort of data that we want to be
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
collecting for for State purposes
 
05:16:42.650 --> 05:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
um uh you know is is this the list here
 
05:16:44.448 --> 05:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
is this the exhaustive list are there
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
other things Nate said you know they
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
collect this is probably a tip of the
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
iceberg obviously from the the data you
 
05:16:54.050 --> 05:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
collect on the doe 25 is so we're not
 
05:16:55.550 --> 05:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
even touching Financial right we're not
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
even touching this is all this is
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
student outcome data and
 
05:17:03.288 --> 05:17:03.298 align:start position:0%
and yeah and and
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and so there may be there but
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
plan it's just not demonstrated here
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
within the state law so it's kind of a
 
05:17:15.890 --> 05:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
we should put all of the information in
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
the state law so we can do a
 
05:17:19.250 --> 05:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
comprehensive or we should all learn not
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
in sort of situation
 
05:17:23.170 --> 05:17:23.180 align:start position:0%
that's something to consider yeah
 
05:17:25.550 --> 05:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
but we're not saying get eliminate while
 
05:17:28.070 --> 05:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
we eliminate no so let's put the rest in
 
05:17:29.930 --> 05:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
it though and we're not we're not coming
 
05:17:31.610 --> 05:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
forward and saying hey we want to add
 
05:17:34.128 --> 05:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
more of these indicators in here when I
 
05:17:36.410 --> 05:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
met with this uh the commissioner when
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
we did this back well 2000 whatever 21
 
05:17:43.250 --> 05:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
20 we've done it so often
 
05:17:45.650 --> 05:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um he and I sat down and we we could
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
drop a list of 25 just like that
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and we put in what we thought was
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
necessary concurrent dual enrollment and
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that really you
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
know give us information which was
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
usable and good information we know knew
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
we'd need it when we're designing
 
05:18:02.810 --> 05:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
budgets when we're chasing the
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
additional dollars and that does help us
 
05:18:07.550 --> 05:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
that helped us when we were able to
 
05:18:09.730 --> 05:18:09.740 align:start position:0%
obtain the extra
 
05:18:12.410 --> 05:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
3.25 million dollars
 
05:18:14.448 --> 05:18:14.458 align:start position:0%
this year for each year the buying in
 
05:18:16.010 --> 05:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
for a concurrent dual enrollment from
 
05:18:18.410 --> 05:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
1.5 I think it was
 
05:18:22.250 --> 05:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's but without that information
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have Finance certain
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
around us to say what do you you know
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
show us why you need it well we have the
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
number of kids we can show why and I
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear we're not
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
proposing that we wouldn't continue to
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
collect that information we we would
 
05:18:34.850 --> 05:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
continue to collect that information
 
05:18:42.788 --> 05:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
are there any things in here which are
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
not federally required yes no those all
 
05:18:52.330 --> 05:18:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of these were state oriented they
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for FAFSA information do they
 
05:18:59.570 --> 05:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
that so it's our federal plan that's
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the Fed so we as the state
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that so what we
 
05:19:05.930 --> 05:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
did was we took the information from our
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
plan that's approved by the feds and put
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
that into state law
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
do you have to put all these in the
 
05:19:12.890 --> 05:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
federal plan we didn't have them in the
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
estate plan right here
 
05:19:15.718 --> 05:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
estate plan right here
so

05:19:19.610 --> 05:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.288 --> 05:19:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
but don't we only because we allow it to
 
05:19:28.970 --> 05:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
be the same because we're pumping this
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
stuff in
 
05:19:33.530 --> 05:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah because we put it there
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
but don't we put it in the Essa plan
 
05:19:41.330 --> 05:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
Ting ones and the federal government and
 
05:19:43.080 --> 05:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
Ting ones and the federal government and
said

05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:19:46.490 --> 05:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know this is what we want to do no
 
05:19:48.288 --> 05:19:48.298 align:start position:0%
the federal the federal plan came first
 
05:19:50.090 --> 05:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
and then we put it in the state plan so
 
05:19:51.770 --> 05:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
what we did was a whole different p-bas
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
system that was in state law in 2017. if
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
you have an old law book in that room
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
over there I'd go grab it because it
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
might be helpful
 
05:20:00.530 --> 05:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
um in this conversation
 
05:20:01.970 --> 05:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
um but there was a whole different p-bas
 
05:20:03.770 --> 05:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
system that was in place and then in
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
that time we said you know what let's
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
not have two different accountability
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
systems with the same assessments of the
 
05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
same kids one of and then two separate
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
lists of which schools are not
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
um are are not providing an adequate
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
education or a bottom five percent of
 
05:20:20.090 --> 05:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
schools so that's when we went in and
 
05:20:21.410 --> 05:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
tied the two together but the federal
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the clinical plan came first and then
 
05:20:27.288 --> 05:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.050 --> 05:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
sort of like my teacher in the law class
 
05:20:31.610 --> 05:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
where we were just taught the federal
 
05:20:33.830 --> 05:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
government makes rights all this stuff
 
05:20:35.810 --> 05:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
and the state just says okay put it in
 
05:20:38.448 --> 05:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
state law that's what we did in this
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
situation yes
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to put all this you
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have to put the number of New
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire scholars in
 
05:20:46.368 --> 05:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
did you
 
05:20:48.288 --> 05:20:48.298 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to put any of those in so
 
05:20:49.970 --> 05:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
we as a state came up with College and
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
Career Readiness indicators because we
 
05:20:53.448 --> 05:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
needed another so you're required to
 
05:20:55.690 --> 05:20:55.700 align:start position:0%
have different different indicators
 
05:20:59.570 --> 05:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
are equity yeah so we were required to
 
05:21:01.070 --> 05:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
have an equity indicator in the federal
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
plan and we as a state chose to have
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicators
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
is this right
 
05:21:08.690 --> 05:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
and um and so our College of career
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicators are what we
 
05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
established and we listed those all out
 
05:21:15.770 --> 05:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and that's what the plan is and then
 
05:21:17.650 --> 05:21:17.660 align:start position:0%
we put that in the plan with a list of
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we came up with that list
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and asked for approval from the
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education from the U.S
 
05:21:25.368 --> 05:21:25.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in our plan to
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
we need to put a big question mark on
 
05:21:31.330 --> 05:21:31.340 align:start position:0%
this page
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
and pursue discussion on this or try to
 
05:21:39.530 --> 05:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
really think this thing out a little bit
 
05:21:41.330 --> 05:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're going to be too much
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have to go to court tomorrow so
 
05:21:53.520 --> 05:21:55.368 align:start position:0%
we have to go to court tomorrow so
yeah

05:21:55.368 --> 05:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:05.448 --> 05:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
good luck
 
05:22:05.458 --> 05:22:07.368 align:start position:0%
good luck
yeah

05:22:07.368 --> 05:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:22:07.378 --> 05:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay so so we we're done for today 266
 
05:22:20.030 --> 05:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
was the last thing we went through that
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
first part and we got that cleaned up or
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
not cleaned up but we know what we have
 
05:22:27.288 --> 05:22:27.298 align:start position:0%
to do and this last part we have to give
 
05:22:30.050 --> 05:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought to that so um we won't
 
05:22:32.930 --> 05:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
be meeting next week other than the one
 
05:22:35.208 --> 05:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
what day do we have Tuesday
 
05:22:37.970 --> 05:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
and some places I know that spring break
 
05:22:41.208 --> 05:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
and then up north most of the state most
 
05:22:42.530 --> 05:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
of the state of school vacation week
 
05:22:45.050 --> 05:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
next week next week so we have nothing
 
05:22:47.570 --> 05:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
else scheduled for next week other than
 
05:22:47.580 --> 05:22:48.708 align:start position:0%
else scheduled for next week other than
two

05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:22:51.288 --> 05:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
but the following week we will have and
 
05:22:54.830 --> 05:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
we'll pick this up can so can I just ask
 
05:22:56.930 --> 05:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
for clarification so where what do you
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
need from the Department for Earth from
 
05:23:00.170 --> 05:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
us at this time because I'm not sure
 
05:23:02.208 --> 05:23:02.218 align:start position:0%
like I know we have a couple areas that
 
05:23:03.890 --> 05:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
we said we would make Corrections and
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatnot but did you get all this
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
Corrections from the first several pages
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed I mean I took notes
 
05:23:12.050 --> 05:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
but I haven't done anything with them
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
yet I don't and I don't even know what
 
05:23:16.250 --> 05:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
the process for doing that is I'm just
 
05:23:17.690 --> 05:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
kind of waiting until we had waited
 
05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
through all this and but yeah we don't
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
have all those answers yet we have to
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
have this bill out what's the date we
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
of uh May notice
 
05:23:36.590 --> 05:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
last day to report all remaining Senate
 
05:23:38.690 --> 05:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
bills because this is not going to a
 
05:23:43.550 --> 05:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.110 --> 05:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
right for me
 
05:23:50.120 --> 05:23:51.788 align:start position:0%
right for me
well

05:23:51.788 --> 05:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:23:54.850 --> 05:23:54.860 align:start position:0%
your why is making one Amendment
 
05:23:57.530 --> 05:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
266 rather than that multiple right
 
05:23:57.540 --> 05:23:59.868 align:start position:0%
266 rather than that multiple right
amendments

05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:24:03.288 --> 05:24:03.298 align:start position:0%
so I I guess what we'll do is meet after
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
this next week I'll set a date then
 
05:24:09.288 --> 05:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
let's see we're going in are we into uh
 
05:24:12.650 --> 05:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
next month yeah we the Thursday will be
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
a session day I'm sure because there's
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
no session days this month
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
there will be in May okay so most likely
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have something where we meet on
 
05:24:26.530 --> 05:24:26.540 align:start position:0%
either that Tuesday or that Wednesday
 
05:24:29.448 --> 05:24:29.458 align:start position:0%
what are you tied up with Finance with
 
05:24:32.448 --> 05:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
the Senate I mean we will be but it's I
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
mean indeterminable I think at this
 
05:24:35.330 --> 05:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
point we have our we have one
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
Presentation tomorrow and one we have a
 
05:24:40.010 --> 05:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
capital presentation I think May 5th or
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
05:24:45.230 --> 05:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
but well what what I'll do is I'll talk
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
with you Caitlyn and find out I'll I'll
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
try to identify the dates we don't have
 
05:24:51.050 --> 05:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
anything scheduled and let you know
 
05:24:53.170 --> 05:24:53.180 align:start position:0%
those dates and you let let me know
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
which is a good date for you okay
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean and I think you know as much
 
05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
of this as we can get done I think will
 
05:25:02.270 --> 05:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
help the department
 
05:25:03.948 --> 05:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
um and I think we can figure out where
 
05:25:05.570 --> 05:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
we can compromise and where we might be
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
some areas that we may not be but we can
 
05:25:11.570 --> 05:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
get a lot done that we could move on
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think I think of the areas
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
that you're it seems like the areas that
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
you guys have the most concern of don't
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually affect the department it was
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
more kind of overall the I think we'll
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
be okay I think I think the the majority
 
05:25:26.208 --> 05:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
of the housekeeping stuff it seemed like
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
we all had concurrence on and that's
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually what we need to be able to
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
really implement the system
 
05:25:32.878 --> 05:25:34.010 align:start position:0%
really implement the system
so

05:25:34.010 --> 05:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll we'll set a time up for
 
05:25:38.090 --> 05:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
the week after next
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay to get together on two six six
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the whole committee
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
unless you don't want to come you know
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be more like a work session try to
 
05:25:53.750 --> 05:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
get this thing squared away a little bit
 
05:25:53.760 --> 05:25:55.970 align:start position:0%
get this thing squared away a little bit
yeah

05:25:55.970 --> 05:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful to know if
 
05:26:01.730 --> 05:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
you wanted to know where the the current
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
193 e colon 3 would reside in 266 where
 
05:26:09.890 --> 05:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
where would that be because E3 has been
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
taken over money yeah we can point that
 
05:26:16.090 --> 05:26:16.100 align:start position:0%
out yeah bring that back yeah yeah
 
05:26:18.890 --> 05:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to leave this all in as is
 
05:26:22.090 --> 05:26:22.100 align:start position:0%
without making Jake
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.680 --> 05:26:26.930 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:26:26.930 --> 05:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:26:35.330 --> 05:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.510 --> 05:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
we have a meeting scheduled for
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
May 8th
 
05:26:46.010 --> 05:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:07.490 --> 05:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right
 
05:27:09.840 --> 05:27:12.948 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right
yeah

05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.550 --> 05:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
I mean if we don't have anything to do
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there is there's so much so
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
many committees I'm trying to remember
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:27.770 --> 05:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
yeah we were doing 306. that's what that
 
05:27:30.770 --> 05:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
is doing yeah that's doing the yeah the
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
education rules
 
05:27:41.770 --> 05:27:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
I got my copy from Jen
