00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
all right we're gonna we're gonna get
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
started with uh division three it's uh
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
12 43 13 minutes 30 minutes later than
 
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.949 align:start position:0%
12 43 13 minutes 30 minutes later than
we

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
had recessed ourselves into
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh the extra time was necessary
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
because um um mr ripple uh and the ols
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
were working on
 
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
were working on
getting

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
some very small things cleaned up so
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
that so that represent waller can look
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
at a perfect copy
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.990 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
i hope we can move through this fairly
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
rapidly because uh we have a hard break
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
at a little bit before two o'clock
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll try to honor that
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and so i i i made i'm i may try some
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
techniques to to move us a little bit
 
00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
techniques to to move us a little bit
quicker

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
has everyone here
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to look at least at
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
least at at least one
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
version of the drafts
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
i i cannot hear you well we're talking
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay so so by uh yes represent walnut
 
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.389 align:start position:0%
okay so so by uh yes represent walnut
yeah

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
i wondered if it's going to be possible
 
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
i wondered if it's going to be possible
for

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
maybe kevin to walk through
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
and show us because i'm looking at this
 
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
and show us because i'm looking at this
and

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.829 align:start position:0%
and
it's

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard for anyone to take
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
a look at this and
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
know the difference between this
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.710 align:start position:0%
know the difference between this
amendment

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and how the bill came to us
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
so if kevin could walk through
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
the changes from the bill that we
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
received uh sure and and he's prepared
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
to do that we talked about it beforehand
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
so if um so with that i guess mr ripple
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh would you start walking us through uh
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
what came to the committee and where
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
um sure well what i'm prepared to do is
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the differences
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
between this version
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
and the version
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh and the version that i emailed out uh
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
so when you say this version i i think
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
you mean that the the newest latest
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
greatest is version number one eight six
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
four that's correct
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i as i understood representative
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
wallner's request
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
is that she she would like us also to
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
touch on
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
and not just from
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 1846 which i think is what you
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
emailed out
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and i think i might need a couple
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
minutes uh in order to
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
in order to do that and compare this to
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay um did did every okay all right i i
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
want to give you time
 
00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.509 align:start position:0%
want to give you time
uh

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
or are you going to be okay if we just
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
go from 1846 to
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
1864. you you want it from the uh bill
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
is introduced
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
i would like it from the bill as
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
introduced as it came from health and
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
human services that's a very fair it's a
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
very fair
 
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
very fair
request

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
and it would really be great to not hear
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
the word policy committee too many times
 
00:15:48.639 --> 00:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
the word policy committee too many times
today

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
so the one we started with
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it has an amendment number
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
that was approved by the house 1678
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
i i think that's everybody's baseline
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of that
 
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.150 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of that
okay

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
all right well i have a couple different
 
00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:38.629 align:start position:0%
all right well i have a couple different
uh

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
marked up versions over here but i can
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
make an attempt to go through
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
the changes between this and the bill as
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
it first came to us
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
so in section one the first paragraph
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
lines eight through fourteen
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
a health facility is defined a bit
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
an urgent care network of three or more
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
clinics licensed under rsa 151 whereas
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
previously it read an urgent care center
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
licensed under rsa
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that was one of the changes proposed by
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
representative irf
yesterday

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
it also states on lines 10 through 12
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
that a health facility shall not include
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
state-operated medical facilities and
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance by a state-operated
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
facility shall not subject such facility
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the requirements of this section
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then on lines 13 and 14 uh we have a
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
term that's a bit duplicative with
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
what's on line nine but i've been uh
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
told that it isn't a difficulty and
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's that the term health facility
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
shall not include any
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
non-hospital-affiliated urgent care with
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
less than three clinics in new hampshire
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing as was
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
already on line nine mr chair
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representing oregon can i just
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
ask you a quick question so
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
we we have this document that you gave
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
us right we're not looking at them i i
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
know that's i just wanted to clarify
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're going back to once
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
we're going back to the original 1678.
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
right the short answer is yes we're
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing what representative wallner asked
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
us to do three minutes ago which was to
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
go from the version that was introduced
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
to us to the most recent version the
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
most recent version
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
is one eight six four right
 
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
is one eight six four right
okay

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay so on lines 15 and 16
 
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
okay so on lines 15 and 16
at

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative edward's request and this
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
is based on the marked up version that
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
he handed out that you handed out
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday representative edwards um
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
workplace violence definition has been
 
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
workplace violence definition has been
shortened

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
shortened
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
to end at other threatening behavior
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
there was previously more to that
 
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
there was previously more to that
sentence

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
a new c has been added on lines 17
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
through 19
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question about that and
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh honor representative walls who's gone
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
but not forgotten
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh she she wanted to know
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
if we were reusing terms that already
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
exist in statute elsewhere do you know
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
if ols considered that question
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know i asked them to take a look
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
at this definition in particular and
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on that
 
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.590 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on that
representative

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
so ols didn't had no
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
they they made no changes to that
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
definition that's correct
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
did they do we know if they checked it
 
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.549 align:start position:0%
did they do we know if they checked it
against

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.630 align:start position:0%
i don't know
okay

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that if
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
we find over i i what i sort of think
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
is we're trying to find a way to say yes
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
to one another
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
put this canoe in the water
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
let all of these organizations start
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
paddling trying to get to where they're
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to go
 
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
trying to go
and

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be another legislative
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
season so if we if we have to tweak this
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
um to for some
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
something that we've overlooked in this
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
process i think we can do that
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
particularly given that we in here we
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
specifically asked the commission to
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
report to um health and human services
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
oversight to let us know
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
what changes may be appropriate so
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
um i i i hope that we don't uh feel that
 
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
um i i i hope that we don't uh feel that
um

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
perfect needs to be the enemy of really
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.549 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
sure

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh roman two starting on line twenty
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
there have been a couple changes
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.149 align:start position:0%
there have been a couple changes
um

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
in particular that first sentence was
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
shortened the sentence that ends uh
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a violence
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
workplace violence prevention program
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that was previously more extensive and
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
per representative edwards proposed
 
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
per representative edwards proposed
changes

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
was the language the program shall
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
consider the size and complexity of the
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
health facility and shall address the
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
following topics
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
and everything that follows down to the
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry a and b remain a and b were
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the original version
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
yes and b was shortened from the
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
i will note that throughout
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
there were references added to hostile
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
words where previously only workplace
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
is down in roman 5 on page 2
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there's now a reference to the chair
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
with the advice of the commission which
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
may recommend updates to statutes or the
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
rule making process
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
may i may i jump in and just
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
point out that on line 19 roman numeral
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
four is is new from what we received
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're correct that is also new right
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
what what we did was
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment adds that the
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of hhs
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
shall follow up on participation in the
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
workplace violence prevention program so
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
that the pro so that participation
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
status is proactively known and that
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
this status is properly reported in the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
annual report
 
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:38.710 align:start position:0%
annual report
and

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're doing that to
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
meet one of the
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
concerns of the of the hospital
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the nursing association
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
there there there's needs to be uh
 
00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:55.029 align:start position:0%
there there there's needs to be uh
pressure

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these groups volunteer
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do their jobs i shouldn't
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
have used voluntarily because this is
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
meant to be a mandate so
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
so go ahead from room uh you have a
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
question on that yes i did
 
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.430 align:start position:0%
question on that yes i did
representative

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
i guess since it is a mandate i guess i
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
why we need this in here
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
because i'm a lazy guy and i want to be
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
able to look at a website and see every
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization that's in the commission
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they are
 
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.070 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they are
participating

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
if i want to see that i would think
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
interested parties given that there
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be a bunch of them would also
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
like to have some public disclosure to
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
me this is a transparency issue
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that also
 
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.430 align:start position:0%
that also
uh

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
adds the kind of
 
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:48.789 align:start position:0%
adds the kind of
pressure

00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
pressure
to

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
these institutions to help motivate them
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
to comply by generating a bottoms-up
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
pressure for them to comply so if the
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
information is public and shareable
 
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
information is public and shareable
then

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
they have all that much more reason to
 
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
they have all that much more reason to
comply

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with it it's
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
really the issue i
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
i mean i just think it's sort of
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
have that kind of i i would disagree but
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um but we'll end up voting on this
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
yep on romans 6 a starting on line 33
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
there was some language added to that
 
00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:28.789 align:start position:0%
there was some language added to that
section

00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
for example the annual report for the
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
calendar year ending december 31st
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
shall include but not necessarily be
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then the incidents cited here were
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
those that were
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
already in the bill again there were
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
the phrase but not any identifiable
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
when you get down to line
 
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:09.590 align:start position:0%
when you get down to line

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
the percentage of employees that have
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
participated in the workplace violence
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
revised consistent with representative

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm on page three yes that was line
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
b starting on line 22 was revised
 
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.029 align:start position:0%
b starting on line 22 was revised
slightly

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
to state that the report shall preserve
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
the distinction between workplace
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
it again repeats that there shall not be
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
any identifiable personal information
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
included in the report on line 24
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
or 23.
 
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.950 align:start position:0%
or 23.
yes

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
roman 8 starting on line 34 is new and
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
that came from representative edwards
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
draft of yesterday this is the
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that the department maintain
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
a website
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it identifies
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
at the top of the next page page four
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the topics to be included on that
 
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:31.110 align:start position:0%
the topics to be included on that
website

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.549 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i think yesterday i talked i asked mr
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
williams a little bit about
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
the website and whether or not
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to be just another
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
tour for the department of health and
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
and if this is going to entail
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
additional resources that they'll need
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
in order to to keep this website
 
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
in order to to keep this website
current

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
the department had given any further
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
so come on up and as you do as i re
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
recall yesterday's testimony you said
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
something to the effect that uh
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
that this is something that the
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
department could support that if it does
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
require additional manpower that we'll
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
include that in the next budget cycle
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
for the record john williams director of
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for the new
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
services and that is a very good recap
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
about what information i provided to
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
committee there's no change
 
00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
committee there's no change
to

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
that as of today's date
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
so would you anticipate that in the next
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
budget we will see
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
some additional i mean once you know how
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
much information
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
is this is going to generate and you'll
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
have to have it in the
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we're fortunate that the
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
effective data the bill
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
does allow the department of
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
um posting on the department's website
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
of the identified information in this
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
amendment there could be other resource
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
demands in the department that we'd like
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
to revisit
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
or at least have the flexibility to
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
revisit with the legislature
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
i would also say
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative walter keep in mind what
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
we one of the things that we've done
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill you can stay there or go
 
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.029 align:start position:0%
with this bill you can stay there or go
back

00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
wherever you're comfortable um is that
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the prior
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
the version is introduced to us was
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
punitive it had a two thousand dollar
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
fines in it uh to be off done at the
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner's uh discretion so that
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
peop these organizations would um uh
 
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.950 align:start position:0%
peop these organizations would um uh
comply

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
more of a free-market bottoms-up
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
approach of making sure that all the
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
interested parties
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
have the information necessary for them
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
to apply pressure locally and that gets
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
us out of the
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
coercive nature of fines and gets us out
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the discretionary nature of giving
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner new authority to issue
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
fines against the select group of
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals so i it
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
i i i included it obviously because i
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea but we spend
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
money all the time on uh public
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
transparency i mean though
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know youtube for example we weren't
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing this two years ago we're spending
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
money on this because it makes
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
us more transparent and that's and
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm trying to do with this
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
um mr ripple
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay and as you just mentioned um
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
the section about the two thousand
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
dollar fine was removed i believe it was
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
in this area of the bill it's now gone
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
we moved down to the newly established
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
workplace safety commission
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think the only change on this page is
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
down on lines 33
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
on line 33 the governor may remove any
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
i do have a question about the
 
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
i do have a question about the
commission

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:06.149 align:start position:0%
commission
please

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
so now that um
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
member of
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
a hospital in new hampshire
 
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
a hospital in new hampshire
so

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
is the state
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
run hospitals still have a
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
member on this i mean it wouldn't be
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
necessary because they are no longer
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
now the chief executive officer of the
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital it's number two
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
would that i mean why would that be
 
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
would that i mean why would that be
necessary

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
if they're not on because although we've
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
made it um
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary for the entirety of this uh
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
this still would represent the
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
being involved and and being able to
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and to provide
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
advice what we heard in testimony is
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire hospital actually has
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
a pretty good workplace violence program
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
and that other institutions may want to
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
pick at the knowledge of the ceo and
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
adopt the best practices as
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital has perceived
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
them so this this is participation in
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
the commission not in the program that's
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's also a distinction we have a
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
commission and we have a program
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
so we've intended to have
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
program portion of it be voluntary
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
they can still opt to do it
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's just i'm i'm letting them know that
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
we would support
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
a new budget for new fte but
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative long you have a
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you mr chairman i i
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand the transparency
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
and and that is the goal here
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm looking at confusion from
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
confusions from people looking at this
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that aren't intimate as we are with this
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
seeing a representative from new
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital on there but not
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
seeing a listing whether the new
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals are active or
 
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals are active or
inactive

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
inactive
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
i you know i
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know so i'm i'm more concerned about
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
going online and seeing
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
a representative of the hospital
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
but not seeing their status
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh i mean we know that they're already
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
proactive in this but the public doesn't
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i think uh we're gonna get down to it
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to seeing it but
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
i i think uh we we came up with new
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
categories of
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
active inactive and we kept
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
other or something like other so
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
something like a new hospital new
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
that that other flexibility in the
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
status could could potentially be used i
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not trying to micromanage the
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
writing of that report but that's what i
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
think could be done okay so there'll be
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
a listing of a healthcare facility
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they're not so
 
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.310 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they're not so
so

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
mr ripple since this is uh
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
the heart of uh
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative long's uh comments
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
could you could you jump us down to the
 
00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
could you could you jump us down to the
um

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
reporting section or would it just be
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
better for us to
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
hang on and because we're going to get
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
to it naturally if we keep going
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
sequentially like this do you mind if
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay let's let's let's just
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
let's just stay on task and in sequence
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we're going to get to it
 
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.829 align:start position:0%
and i think we're going to get to it
okay

00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
so we left off on line 33 the governor
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
may remove any member of the commission
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
with cause i think the next change is on
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
line 11 but the initial term of the
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
then there's no other change until line
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
19 where other than police reports was
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
added after all information
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
just say to everyone what we talked
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
about beforehand when this goes and
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
assuming this goes to enrolled bills
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's that tiny little typo on line 11
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
where the word terms should become term
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the next change is on the next
 
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.150 align:start position:0%
i believe the next change is on the next
page

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
page six
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
on lines two and three
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh added to the end of that sentence was
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
provided that the information sharing
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
process shall include de-identification
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
of any personally identifiable
 
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.150 align:start position:0%
of any personally identifiable
information

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
now now on this i noticed that they
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
removed my reference to the principle of
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
data minimization do you know what their
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
thinking was because that's actually its
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
own separate principle
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't know this was the language
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
that ols came up with i i think i did
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
provide your exact language but they
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
made some tweaks here and there
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right so um i i don't i don't care
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
to send this another amendment in for
 
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.790 align:start position:0%
to send this another amendment in for
that

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
so okay um
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the next change is down on line nine
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
where and data privacy was added
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
on line 10 the reporting date was
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards could i
 
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.150 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards could i
could

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital association spoke about
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
the reports and how they wanted it to
 
00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
the reports and how they wanted it to
mirror

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
mirror
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
the same process as the
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
as another group
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
the quality
 
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
the quality
yeah

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
i wondered how close we're marrying that
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.109 align:start position:0%
is this
actually

00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
th this is actually not
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
something that i'm really passionate
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
about i just thought that intellectually
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
these reports would be more useful to us
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
if they were
 
00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
if they were
current

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
going into the budget year
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
so that we know what's going on
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh and and if there are new bills to be
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
heard we've got the most current
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
information available to help us
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
consider the bill
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't have a particular
 
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't have a particular
um

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
point of interest or authorship in that
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
other than i thought it just made more
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
sense to make these
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
as important as this commission is let's
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
make these reports as useful as possible
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
by synchronizing the timing
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
so so i will get uh
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
give ms
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
um minihan an opportunity to come up and
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
address just various things but
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
let's get through all of these before we
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
get her out that was just one i don't
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
know what the process what the other
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
process is yeah the quality one it's
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're probably out of phase with the
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
quality because i'm sure if they took
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
the quality then they probably were
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
thinking july one you know but
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
we'll find out
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple yeah i i don't know what
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
happened to
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
um the activator
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i had that section
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
on my notes it would
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
be in section eight right so that's
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
under the uh website maintained by hhs
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
so that's near the top of page four on
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
line three the website shall include the
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
participation status of each facility as
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
active inactive run oh okay
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh so it says unknown not other yep
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
so if we go back to page six
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i think the last change i had mentioned
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
was the reporting date of january 31st
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
on line 10. right
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
and with the data as of december 31st i
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
think is what that means
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay correct and down on line
 
00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:56.550 align:start position:0%
okay correct and down on line
20

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh the advice incentive a majority of
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
consent of a majority of members of the
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
commission was changed to the advice of
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
members of the commission
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
and lines 22 through 24 are new and this
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
just reiterates that medical facilities
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
operated by the state are not subject to
 
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.910 align:start position:0%
operated by the state are not subject to
the

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
commission established that follows
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay so since we had them as a member of
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
the commission is this written the way
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
well i still believe they're not subject
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think the only change remaining
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
is the repeal date of march 1st 2034 on
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
line 33. right so that's more than 10
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
years to
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
so uh mr ripple has walked through the
 
00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
so uh mr ripple has walked through the
changes

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
we have about 49 minutes
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
um yes ma'am could i ask mr ripple one
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
question yes so
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um as we walk through here
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't see
 
00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
i didn't see
in

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards's um
 
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.550 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards's um
original

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this draft on this amendment
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
he had um
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
he cited the right to the freedom from
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.190 align:start position:0%
he cited the right to the freedom from
discrimination

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
discrimination
um

00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of times the bill has that been
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
dropped yeah it got dropped because uh
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
miss minahan was correct and i i was
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
wrong okay uh that uh she she
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
cited that that section of 354
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't applicable to the private
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals and i i thought it was i i
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
actually had done a lot of research on
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
354 and i'm surprised but okay great
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
no that that was my main one okay
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
so with that uh let's invite
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%

and and say what i what i think this
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment has done
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
is it maintained all of the mandatory it
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
maintained the mandatory nature of the
 
00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:38.710 align:start position:0%
maintained the mandatory nature of the
program

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
while removing
 
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.150 align:start position:0%
while removing
fines

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
fines
 
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
fines
adding

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
public information and
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
public organic pressure to for these
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
organizations to respond and behave
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
um and that it uh doubled down on
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that we don't want
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
being distributed between the members of
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.589 align:start position:0%
the commission
so

00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to hear from you
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
however you want to proceed
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman um against
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
steven president hospital association um
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
i actually just returned from a national
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
meeting with hospitals from across the
 
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.190 align:start position:0%
meeting with hospitals from across the
country

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
and talking to my colleagues who run
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
state hospital associations in other
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
states and i can assure you that this is
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important issue not just
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's an issue that
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals are facing all across the
 
00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:29.270 align:start position:0%
hospitals are facing all across the
country

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
and are looking for opportunities to to
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
do something many are doing different
 
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.550 align:start position:0%
do something many are doing different
things

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
but this is not an issue that's
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
solely here in new hampshire
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is an incredibly important
 
00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:42.950 align:start position:0%
this bill is an incredibly important
bill

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
of ours that hospitals sought to have
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
introduced this year because we want to
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
find a way to solve this problem to
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
prevent violence and to protect the
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
health care workforce that serves our
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
patients and our communities
 
00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
patients and our communities
so

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass that supports our
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals and healthcare
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
heroes in doing the work that they do to
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
prevent violence um and ensure that they
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
work in a safe environment so let's just
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
make certain that everybody understands
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
that um so again we're looking at this
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment obviously just saw this
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
version um today
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
and based upon what we had seen
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday i would say it's a
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know vast improvement um from from
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
what we had seen
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
i want to just ask a couple of questions
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
and then paula can speak more
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
specifically to various issues i
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
understand the notion that you wanted to
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
make this voluntary
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's a certainly a different approach
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
you've referenced though
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
by including a provision that the
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to follow up and
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
post on websites as a means of
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
pressuring and you know sort of holding
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
people accountable to participate
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
i wasn't we weren't asking this to be
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory because we were concerned that
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
people would not participate that's not
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
a concern that's not an issue um so i
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear we're not
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
anticipating that anybody anybody's
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to say i don't want to participate
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
because they believe this is important
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney and so maybe this is
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
a concern that is is not a a relevant
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
one but when you've made
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
the state hospitals and state facilities
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
not a participant not subject to the
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
quality commission and i just want to be
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
certain that if the
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
state hospital and other state
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
facilities choose to participate in one
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
way or the other because you're right
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
they do have uh workplace safety
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
programs and and things in place that
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've actually shared and
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
helped educate other hospitals about
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
when they come to the commission and
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
share that information
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to make certain that when
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing so that those that
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
information maintains
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality protections that
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
everyone else who is subject to the
 
00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:02.470 align:start position:0%
everyone else who is subject to the
commission

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
is under so again
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that why that's
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
important and just wanting to make
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
certain that if somebody's coming to the
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
commission sharing information
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
participating voluntarily that somehow
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
they lose that confidentiality
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
protections that everybody else has
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
who's a part of the commission may i
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
address just that point
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
because i i'm not a lawyer
 
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.670 align:start position:0%
because i i'm not a lawyer
um

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
but uh but we're we're calling out
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
specifically as a member the
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
designee or the chief executive officer
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire hospital that
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're specifically in writing a member
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
of this commission
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then in the confidentiality section
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
it it basically starts out that says all
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the information submitted to or
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
collected by the commission it shall be
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
collected by the commission it shall be
confidential

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh so i to to just that one concern i i
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
i think we're good
 
00:45:57.839 --> 00:45:58.710 align:start position:0%
i think we're good
okay

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
again i want to make certain that we're
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
not doing anything that would prevent
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital or somebody else
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
from sharing information um in a way
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
that could be discoverable and the like
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
all right and and i think it's covered
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
and because we're going to have an
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing at least annual relationship uh
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
with because i'm on the joint health and
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
human services
committee

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
um if there's an issue there
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
that comes up i don't think there will
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
be we we can address it
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
um so just
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
one other question or one other point
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and um i think
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
kevin ripple
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
explained this and maybe i just didn't
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
hear it correctly
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
but it's on page 3 line 18 through 21
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
the percentage of employees that have
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
participated in the workplace violence
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
prevention program in the reporting year
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
immediately preceding the incident um
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just not i just want to understand
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
what we're asking so who how many
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
employees participated in the program
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and was that in terms of education um
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite clear to me what we're
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
asking and what were what you're seeking
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
um to understand okay give me just a
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
second because um
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
this was a change from the original
 
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
this was a change from the original
um

00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay if you go to the version that came
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
to us and i don't think you have it
 
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.349 align:start position:0%
to us and i don't think you have it
necessarily

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
this this this area said
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
the percentage of employees that have
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
participated in the workplace violence
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
prevention program in the year preceding
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
the incident
 
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.670 align:start position:0%
the incident
so

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
so having had to do
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
data call reports in in in my past
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
the way i would interpret that is if i
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
have an incident on march 23rd
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
i have to calculate a new percentage
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
from like march 22 yesterday
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
to a year ago so that that each
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
incident that i reported would require a
 
00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
incident that i reported would require a
separate

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.870 align:start position:0%
separate
uh

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
data analysis and calculation of the
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
percentage so rather than leave that
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in there
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
what i attempted to do and maybe it's
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
just as ambiguous is is to say
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's it is sufficient to use the
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
percentage that got reported in the
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
annual report so that it doesn't have to
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
be recalculated on a contemporaneous
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
basis for every uh single incident that
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
um and then the last thing i will
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
comment on relative to the timing of the
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
reports um as you know the new hampshire
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare quality and safety commission
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
which has been in existence for many
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
many years
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
has a reporting
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
date of on or before june 30. and the
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
value of that that i think we have found
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
is that when they make that report by
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
the you know it's usually june 1st of
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
they present that they share that with
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
the speaker the president the senate the
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
governor with the hhs oversight
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee they actually present to the
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
hhs oversight committee it allows them
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
if there are changes that are necessary
 
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
if there are changes that are necessary
that

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
would be contemplated under um you know
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
the the commission it gives them
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
time and the legislature time to
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
consider that as they're moving into the
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
coming year um from a legislative
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
perspective so that they then have the
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
ability to to get that sort of in
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
process so that by january one um when
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
the session begins that legislation is
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
is in place so i'm just going to cut you
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
off for because i agree with you if
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's if that's the way you view it if
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way you think this report is
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to be more useful to the the other
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
consumers of this report i'm i'm i'm
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
fine with uh putting the the dates
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the report
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
back to the way they were in the
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
original i i think the one thing we may
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
have added in this is
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
although the year ending is on a date i
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
guess you would pick june 30th
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's still another month
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
before the report has to be
 
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
before the report has to be
um

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
um
produced

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
produced
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
the way the way and then just interrupt
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
real quick the way the quality
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
commission um
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
does so it's on or before june 30th um
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the the fiscal year ends um
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
june 30. um they have traditionally
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
issued their report on june 1st um so
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
the the they're able to do that they
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
have their last meeting in may they're
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
able to make those recommendations and
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
put that together so that they have that
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
um done in a in a timely way i i i won't
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll support exactly what you just
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
said whatever you want i i thought i was
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
being helpful if i'm not being helpful
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'll just back out of that if i can if i
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
can take that uh you agree with whatever
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
i want
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh no it's a it's a very finite
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with dates but
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
you can't blame me for trying yeah so
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
the s so
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
so later we're going to have to make a
 
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
so later we're going to have to make a
motion

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we're probably going to make a
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
motion that says pending the changes
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know so that we can keep moving
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
so

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the reason we
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
supported that
 
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
supported that
was

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we would have time
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
we started looking at the budget
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
february 15th
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
if there was something we needed to
 
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
if there was something we needed to
change

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
that was in the budget that's a good
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
time now it's the latest data he wanted
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
the freshest data not something six
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
months eight months old
 
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.710 align:start position:0%
months eight months old
then

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
if it's a policy change we can do it in
 
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
if it's a policy change we can do it in
hb2

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
numbers change in the budget we can do
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
it in hb1 but we wanted the latest data
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
thinking as a finance committee
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
our actions start on february 15th
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to look for the latest
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
data that's why he chose that reporting
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
date understood and but i i think also
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
just for completeness um your point of
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
view would also just support the idea
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
that if there is a legislative change
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
and our windows open up in september for
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
new legislation that we're hitting that
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
new window as well so
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
i you know uh i
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
i it's either way and given that you
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
guys are going to have to live with this
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to go with the dates that you
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
prefer and i would just add you know to
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
the extent that there are issues that
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
are coming up that from a budgetary
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
perspective that are identified um
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
we can certainly make that information
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
available to you as um you know in a
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
timely way relative to the budget um so
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right do you have do you have more
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
of the i think that was three things you
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
might have said
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
no i don't um one i think maybe just
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
editorial or change that maybe is very
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
minor but if you're making a change
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
anyway on page five line four
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
rsa126a13 i think there's a comma
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be a comma and and then it says
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner i think it's and to
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner because your proposed
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
changes you added to health and human
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
services oversight established in rsa
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
and to the commissioner otherwise it
 
00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:24.710 align:start position:0%
and to the commissioner otherwise it
doesn't

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
it i think we just need the right do it
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
kevin i think that's a good editorial
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
catch i think enrolled bills could have
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
taken care of it but if we got to open
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
up a fresh amendment we could just put
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
it in there
 
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.069 align:start position:0%
it in there
yeah

00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman sorry i could just
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
ask uh clarifying questions so i assume
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
january thirty first on page six line
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
ten is being changed to june 30th
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
is the date also being
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
let me just ask a question before i
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
answer your question or um when when
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
does your data year end when is the data
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
collection supposed to end
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
so that all has to get figured out in
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
rule making um so this goes into effect
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
january 1st 2023 and we need rule making
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
um again we mirrored this process after
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
the quality commission they meet five
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
times a year and um and they
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is a little different
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
because of the data collection so um
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think we can make this all work um
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
i mean they will probably be collecting
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
the report is due annually let me just
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
annual report on page
 
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:46.150 align:start position:0%
annual report on page
two

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.160 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to say if you're
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatever your data year you want it to
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
end if you want it to end june 30th then
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
it ends june 30th third of data but you
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
still give them 30 days to create the
 
00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:16.150 align:start position:0%
still give them 30 days to create the
report

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
because they've got to collect all the
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay does that is that what you're
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
expecting mr ripple
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
end the data collection on june 30th and
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
august 1
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
or 31 july
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the other is the commission's report
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm unsure what the ideal reporting
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
dates are for the two types
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
can you just strike dates and leave it
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
or do we or do we have to thumb wrestle
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
this to get
 
00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:10.630 align:start position:0%
this to get
pinpoints

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
you could say um on page 6 line 10 the
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
commission shall annually report its
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
findings and leave it
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
blank blank okay
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
and and you can do that in the amendment
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
is there another date in there that we
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
there's a date for the individual
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
facility reporting
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh which is
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
december 31st
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i think you
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
you could do something similar here and
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
simply say the annual report as required
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
under paragraph five shall include and
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
remove any reference to a date
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
right so it would just say the annual
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
report for the calendar year or no for
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the annual report yeah
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
annual report
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the hospital association
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
has standardized from years ago being on
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
another committee it's like everyone had
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
a different fiscal year do you still
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
have that experience with the various
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals yes
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
yes so basically you'd want it at the
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
end of their fiscal year not not
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily because this doesn't um
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
impact them in that way um it's just we
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
need a uniform date for everyone to
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
submit the report so it's they collect
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
the data they will be
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
collecting the data
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
as they see fit
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
probably monthly for most hospitals um
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
as they compile their data and then
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
submit it annually or they may submit it
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
quarterly that's where i think rule
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
making will allow for some flexibility
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully and i would imagine even if
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's not done in rule making the
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission has enough adults on it they
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
can figure it out for the standard right
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
so i want i want to i want to try to put
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
some words in your mouth and see if you
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
agree or if you want to modify it
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.670 align:start position:0%
i i
i

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital association
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
although this isn't what you anticipated
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
coming out of this committee that you
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
could live with it and we can work with
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
it and and we can
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
revisit it in the future
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
are you going to oppose this amendment
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh no mr chairman we are not okay
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
support so so thank you for that if um
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
now now you can say it in your own words
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
if you want if you're if you want to let
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
me know how disappointed you are in the
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
process that's okay too um
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'll all i will say is you know as i
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
said when i started this is an
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly important piece of
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
legislation one that um you know we've
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
worked on uh for many months um years uh
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
prior to this and this is an issue that
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
is of utmost importance to our members
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative process
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
and it does not always end where it
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
begins um and you know we work through
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
the process to try and make it
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
as best as we can um
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
you said you know we shouldn't let
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
perfection be the enemy of the good um
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly true in many
 
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly true in many
instances

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have to make certain
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
that whatever that process whatever
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
comes out at the other end of the
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
process continues to support the the
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal um i think we've
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
we've come to a place that that we can
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
be supportive um certainly not where we
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
started what we would have uh what we
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
sought um but this is a a is a very
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
important and good first step and um we
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
will continue to work uh to make it
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
better um over the years as as we see uh
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
the experience with the the the
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
commission and and again preventing
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
violence in the workplace and protecting
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
the health uh and safety of our our
 
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
the health uh and safety of our our
employees

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for all of that and and i
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
gotta say we could write the best law in
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
the world but we're not gonna prevent
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
violence uh well the best we can do is
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate it and get our people ready to
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
but you know i i i if we could get rid
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
of violence in the world uh you know uh
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
putin would be on his yacht somewhere
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know so it's it i don't i i i just
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
the the reasonable objective here is
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
that we come up with a program that
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
attempts to mitigate
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
the risk and prepares the people to deal
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
with the incidents i think uh would you
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
take questions if the other
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
representatives have any
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh are there any other questions
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative long thank you i
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
hesitated to ask this question because
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid of the answer but uh you went
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
to a meeting of a national associate
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
national meeting
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh where other states are also working
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion where does this stand
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
towards other states i mean is this
 
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.390 align:start position:0%
towards other states i mean is this
proactive

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a very proactive
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
approach um many states have taken uh
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
steps to increase the penalties for
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
anyone uh who's convicted of striking a
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
health care worker um
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
we've not chosen to begin there um
 
01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
we've not chosen to begin there um
because

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
just making something a stiffer penalty
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
or a higher level of crime doesn't
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
prevent uh the act from occurring in the
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
first place so what we said we needed to
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
do is to try and bring folks together to
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
understand what's happening how it's
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
happening how we prevent it um so again
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is a is an important first
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
step um and it's one that others can
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
certainly hopefully learn from great
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any other questions
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i appreciate your tolerance
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
of of my sometimes emotional uh
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
reactions ms minihan
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
this stuff is important uh to all of us
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
represer mr thomas
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
do you do you want to wave off or do you
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
have anything you want to say for the
 
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:10.150 align:start position:0%
have anything you want to say for the
nurses

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sean thomas demers
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
and praise all representing the new
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire nurses association
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
i will just echo
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
what the hospital association said in
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
that the goal here obviously is to
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
support and protect the safety of our
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
health care workers obviously in our
 
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.150 align:start position:0%
health care workers obviously in our
case

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
the state's nurses and i think
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment here having addressed
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns raised by the
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
hospital association today
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and all the work this committee has
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
done over the last several days and you
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
re in you mr chair
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
going back even before that when this
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
was in the policy committee i think
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
we've arrived at at a place now that you
 
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.950 align:start position:0%
we've arrived at at a place now that you
know

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
in your words is something you know we
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
can live with and work with and so i
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
think uh so i appreciate your um
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
this committee's work on this bill
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you are there any questions
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
from mr thomas nursing association
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh and go ahead chairman if
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
you don't mind it there was i i did
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
notice two technical edits and i figure
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
if there's an amendment no you're very
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
good at that please please point them
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
out uh so on page one
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh line 22
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
there is the new language here which
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
says shall address the following topics
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then or
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that be and
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the shall
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
i the ore just seems confusing that's i
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
but that's you know take it or leave
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
that i'm not
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
not overly concerned
 
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
not overly concerned
on

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
page two
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
the one real technical change i think
 
01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
the one real technical change i think
was

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made and that's on line
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
four it says a process to report
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
workplace violence i think we need to
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
add there and hostile words
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
like we did it elsewhere
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good catch and the reason i
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
went with an or on the first one instead
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
of an and
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
is because i i didn't know that there
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be others that they would want to
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
add into the report and that makes sense
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead and add it
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then the very the last one just on
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
on line nine here and and
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
maybe this was an ols
 
01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:23.589 align:start position:0%
maybe this was an ols
um

01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
change and and that's fine they you know
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
they maybe analyze this different than i
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
did but it seems like that or there on
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i'm okay with that again i
 
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.349 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i'm okay with that again i
i'm

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think of ores and ands and
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
my computer program in class and
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
so small things small things
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh all right is that is that it that's
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
all thank you very much and thank you
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
for your contributions to the drafting
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
of this um over the weekend and just
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
even last night i understand you you put
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
some stuff into mr ripple so so thank
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
you for that you're welcome thank you
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
and and then mr ripple
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
if if i if i really wanted the
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
principles of data minimization included
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
do you know where that would go
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
do you know where that would go
uh

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
so it's towards the back under
 
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.470 align:start position:0%
so it's towards the back under
confidentiality

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.589 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
3

01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
right above
 
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.109 align:start position:0%
right above
administration

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
i see it
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i had the principles of data
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
minimization will be respected to
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
include de-identification so
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
de-identification is a subset of the
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i'd like i'd like the principle
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
referenced as well okay we can do that
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.309 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
um i think we're getting close to
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
a vote
on

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this amendment and and
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
so miss ripple and with us all listening
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
has i think you've probably got about
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
six or seven tweaks something in that
 
01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:27.589 align:start position:0%
six or seven tweaks something in that
neighborhood

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
you want to walk through them and and
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
then i'm gonna uh do a straw vote if
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be okay with this sure um so
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
starting in the order
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh line 10
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
the reference to a specific reporting
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
date will be removed
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
i will read annually
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
with no date
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
on page 1 line 22 the or will be changed
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
the addition of hostile words i did not
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually get the page and line number
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think it was uh
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
is on page two page two
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to rush it take take your
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
time i know that
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detail also on page two
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
line 9
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
the principle of data minimization
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
will be added to
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh the paragraph that ends at the top of
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
and there were two
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
very minor changes that i think we were
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
originally going to take care of in the
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment process but might as well
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
take care of them now they're both on
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
line 11 terms will be changed to term
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
and on line four we'll add a comma after
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh represent an organ
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i think the word two is added there
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
oh there was a two we added a two
 
01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
oh there was a two we added a two
somewhere

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
on line four oh to the commissioner okay
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
and to the commissioner okay
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that's it
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's all that i have i don't know
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative irf did you want me to
 
01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
representative irf did you want me to
address

01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
the issue and the the definition of
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
health facility as long as we're in here
 
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
health facility as long as we're in here
anyway

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
you might just take out the first
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
reference to yeah the fewer than three
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
of them that's covered with the sentence
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
you did add in at the end of that
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
definition so on page one line nine
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
where it reads uh or an urgent care
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
network of three or more clinics
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
licensed under rsa 151 that would come
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
out because that's already addressed on
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't move the reference to the license
 
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.590 align:start position:0%
don't move the reference to the license
part

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
just remove just change network of three
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
clinics to um
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
urgent care
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
facilities what was the word that was in
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
the original oh right um
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
or urgent care
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
or urgent care facility would stay in
 
01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
or urgent care facility would stay in
right

01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
license under rsa licensed under rsa 151
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
so only uh the reference to a network of
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
three or right because that's what you
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
in line 13 and 14 you basically address
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
the three or more clinics
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
that specific line will read as it did
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the original bill or an urgent care
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
center licensed under rsa 151
 
01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
center licensed under rsa 151
correct

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you okay
 
01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh thank you okay
so

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
is anyone
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
needing miss ripple to repeat any more
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
of those tweaks
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
you have everyone is clear on what those
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
tweaks are okay
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
so so by a show of hands
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
i would like to see uh how many of the
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee would be willing to accept uh
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
1864 with the tweaks and modifications
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple just described
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
so if you're in favor of that amendment
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed raise your hand and
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
see no one so um
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
so if we had a motion uh on this
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative irf we could second it
 
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
representative irf we could second it
and

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
begin a vote
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
do you want to move the
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
the unusual changes that we just made or
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
just the whole thing has modified what i
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
what i'd like what i'd like to do is
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.149 align:start position:0%

emotion

that uh
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
has us adopt
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
