00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.990 align:start position:0%
and
important

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
um um the prior Administration in
 
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
Washington uh proposed new title 9 rules
 
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
related to due process when uh someone
 
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
is accused of sexual harassment or
 
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
something like that um those rules um
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
are now currently the um the law of the
 
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
land to provide uh greater um um options
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
and um due process rights to the uh to
 
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
anyone accused of uh of a from a
 
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
complaint and the current Administration
 
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
in Washington DC has proposed new rules
 
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
that roll those um due process rights
 
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
back um it is my understanding that
 
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
there is a final draft of those rules um
 
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 align:start position:0%
available but um it is still just a
 
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
final draft and they have not moved
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
forward to implement um these new rules
 
00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 align:start position:0%
but uh some of the issues that have been
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
raised in relation to these new rules on
 
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
due process for Title 9 UM include um
 
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just mention three or four um a
 
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
return to what is known as the single
 
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
investigator model which empowers a
 
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
college administrator a single
 
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
administrator to investigate judge and
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
sanction any alleged Mis
 
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
conduct uh
 
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
secondly the um new
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
regulations um W could deny students
 
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
access to evidence against them
 
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
providing them only with a description
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
of relative evidence a summary of
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
relative evidence and that could be
 
00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 align:start position:0%
provided orally rather than any um
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
written uh testimony transcripts Etc
 
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh third the rules also allow schools to
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
deny accused students a live hearing and
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to question their
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
accusers which I think is a major major
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
issue um back in 2018 I'll just point
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
out that um when the um previous
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
administration rules were being um
 
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed um there was an effort to uh
 
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.270 align:start position:0%
reviewed um there was an effort to uh
postpone

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
postpone
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh those rules put forward by secretary
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
Devas and the foundation for individual
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
rights and expression uh noted that
 
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.550 align:start position:0%
rights and expression uh noted that
since

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
2011 and this was in 2018 so seven years
 
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 117 federal courts and as
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
well as a number of state courts had
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
raised concerns about the lack of
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
meaningful procedural Protections in
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
campus uh uh uh uh reviews of
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
complaints um I I think that the bill
 
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
complaints um I I think that the bill
before

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
us puts into place for New Hampshire
 
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
some very
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
important uh criteria for due process
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
procedures uh if you look on page two um
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
lines four and five the right to receive
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
notice 7 days prior to a hearing line
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
seven and eight the right to receive at
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
least 5 days before a listing of
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
witnesses who have provided or will
 
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
provide evidence uh against the
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
student down to 11 and 12 the right to
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
presumption that no violation
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
occurred innocent until proven guilty I
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
think we've all heard
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
about um line 17 the right to confront
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
and cross-examine
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
Witnesses in other words the right to a
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
live hearing of the charges um so that
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
um the accused can cross examine
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and on line 19 the right to
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
provide uh defense and call Witnesses in
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
support of the person accused I think
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
all these are
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental to our system of justice and
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
certainly should be in um any uh
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
hearings uh on um accusations in on
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
college campuses as well and with these
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
pending new
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
rules uh from the current Administration
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
in Washington I think it is very
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
important that we set the standard here
 
00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you very much
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
started with um with the the federal the
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the federal uh due process
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
rules both made by the prior
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
Administration and being considered now
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
by the U uh Biden Harris Administration
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
but do the um do the federal rules apply
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
to um all schools public and private
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%

I have read in one um uh article that um
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
it might not apply across the board and
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
could apply differently to private and
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
public um institutions uh especially
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
you further question yes represent Luna
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair um when it um
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
when you talk about student
 
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
organizations why does it apply
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
to um what what why doesn't it apply to
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
to just student organizations that are
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
recognized or approved but also to I
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
guess I I don't know if you can call it
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
a student organization but a group of
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
students who sought recog miss or
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
such

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to put words in
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's mouth but I would
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
think student organization is one that
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
um has been um recognized by the
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
institution rather than one who has not
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
been recognized um that's that's my
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
opinion follow up on that so so thanks
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
well the reason I asked you is because I
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
I think you're the you're well no
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
represent Lynn is the prime sponsor of
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
the correct so um so uh yes if if
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is is when when he
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
comes up I'll I'll ask about um about
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
that because on line 26 it talks about
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
um a group of students who may have been
 
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.670 align:start position:0%
um a group of students who may have been
denied

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
recognition thank thank you any F yes
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock thank you thank you
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
once again I'll be done with this uh sen
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
what prompted
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
what prompted
this

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
um I think uh in in my mind um uh it was
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
prompted by uh information um that we
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
became aware of about the uh new rules
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
that were being proposed um and uh uh
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed about those those
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
rules um so I think I think it's very
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
timely um and that the rules have not
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
been put in place but um are still
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
pending and in draft form so I I think
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
we need to uh if you might say get out
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of the
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
game thank you thank
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
chair there will be a number of other
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
people coming forth to testify on this
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
so if it's a question that could be you
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
know maybe given to one of the others
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
that are coming up we have people from
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
the University system as well as you
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
know further on this bill represent Amon
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
I'll Rec I you thank you chair lab and
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually a followup to representative
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
woodcock's question
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just trying to follow the
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
history and maybe get a little more of
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it this bill as I understand it proposes
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
to secure in New Hampshire statute what
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
is currently federal statute but may be
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
changing is that first of all correct
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then I have a i
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
I think that the uh intention is to yes
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
put into New Hampshire statute uh I'm
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
not sure if it exactly matches what is
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
in current um uh Federal Title 9 UM or I
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the current um uh but
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
I I did not draft this uh uh so um so
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
this may in fact be for representative
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
Lynn but just to put it on the
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
table how does this compare with what
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
the Fed feral statute
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
was prior
 
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.190 align:start position:0%
was prior
[Music]

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
to sorry I'm having to make sure I say
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
this correctly prior to the Trump
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
administration because that's the
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
current one is that correct that that is
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
correct so then I mean prior to before
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
that how does it
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
compare um some of the um uh language in
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
the proposed new title 9 regs um are
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
roll backs to prior to
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
2018 I'm not sure if they all are um I
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
haven't done a side by side but some of
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
them uh definitely are roll backs thank
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
you so at this time I'm
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
gonna call forward uh from the
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:06.629 align:start position:0%
 
Cronin

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman M committee uh
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
Tom Cronin I'm the uh executive director
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
of government relations for the
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
University system good to be with you
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
all this morning uh so usnh is signed in
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 1288 as
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
introduced our biggest concern with the
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially it is laying out a
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all framework for faculty
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
students and student organizations
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
university uh at present we believe we
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
have ample due process to protect uh to
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
govern our communities disciplinary
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
issues that allow flexibility and
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
responsiveness depending on the issue at
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
hand two really particular concerns we
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
have first uh at present our uh
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
significant portion of our tenur faculty
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then portions of our non- tenyear
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
lecturer and adjunct faculty are
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
governed by eight different existing
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements passing
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation would require us to
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
open every single one of those up in
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
order to come into alignment with those
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
agreements uh which would obviously be a
 
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.069 align:start position:0%
agreements uh which would obviously be a
significant

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
challenge the second is for students and
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
student organizations uh House Bill 1288
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
would require comprehensive due process
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
for all disciplinary issues uh it
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
require the same process for minor
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
infractions that could lead to a warning
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
as it would for more serious infractions
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that could lead to a student being
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
suspended or expelled from the
 
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.629 align:start position:0%
suspended or expelled from the
University

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
University
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't view uh you know
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
major punishments like that as a a minor
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
thing that we would do without ensuring
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
that our students have ample due process
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to understand what the
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
complaints against them are the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to question those to work
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
through a system uh before a final
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
decision is made uh so in our opinion we
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
believe the way that we currently
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
operate in terms of our due process
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
rights to protect in some cases property
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
rights of our students and in some cases
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
our faculty are are well established and
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
and are working fine for the University
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
system as drafted we're concerned that
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
this would increase the number of
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
hearings that we have to go through each
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
year from around 80 uh across the system
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
to more than 3,000 uh there is a fiscal
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
note attached here that would be largely
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
due to the additional manour the
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
additional investigators the additional
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
volunteers we need to go through all of
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
those hearings that could range
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere between1 and $2 million in
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
additional expenses a year um so those
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
are some our biggest concerns we had
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
however understanding obviously the the
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
views of the sponsors if the committee
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
is interested in moving forward uh we
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
had a few suggestions on amendments one
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
you could exclude employees governed by
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements that
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
certainly handles one of the big
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
concerns on uh represented faculty uh
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
those folks do have clear disciplinary
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
processes built into those contracts
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that are designed to protect them and
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
their property rights the second would
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
be to remove the word reprimand from the
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
definition of disciplinary proceedings
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
reprimand is not defined anywhere in the
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
bill but the way we would view it is
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
you're treating again you know to use an
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
example that's prevalent on a college
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
campus uh a 20-year-old student caught
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
with a beer can is being treated the
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
same way as a student who could be
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
potentially facing expulsion from the
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
University if we were able to find
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
either a strong definition for reprimand
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
to sort of suggest like it is a uh an
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
activity that you know is facing a
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
severe punishment uh or just simply
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
remove reprimand and be clear that the
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill only only involves those most
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
serious cases that could involve
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
somebody being removed from the
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
University uh third uh representative
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
luno sort of got to this we would strike
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
uh the language or has sought
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
recognition or approval from as written
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
now you're sort of giving a right to a
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
student organization that hasn't been
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
established um so there's no difference
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
in that case between a recognized
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
student org and an unrecognized student
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
org and then similar um right now the
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
definition or the protection for student
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
organ organization suggests that they'd
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
be deprived either temporarily or
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
permanently of any rights or privileges
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh we would ask you again to sort of be
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a more significant uh
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know punishment that they'd be
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
facing uh potentially organizational
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
suspension dis dismissal Etc that's said
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
we so we think those amendments if we
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
able to work through something like that
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
certainly reduce the likely
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
administrative expense and burden uh
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
across the system nevertheless we we
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
would continue to argue that our
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
existing processes work for our
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
community and a one-size fits-all
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh mandate does not and I wanted to
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
quickly understanding certainly where
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell was coming from
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
in his testimony my understanding from a
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
quick conversation with legal council
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
before he had to sneak down to a
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
different hearing is that at least in
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
the first circuit where where we are
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
governed we are required and believed uh
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
we to a student facing significant
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues does have the right
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
to cross-examine uh which I know is one
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the big questions as we we look
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
towards the new title 9 regulations um
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
and then there is a bit of a circuit
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
split just in terms of as a public
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
institution what our requirements are in
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
terms of due process uh compared to
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
private institutions so I'll stop there
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
and try and take questions thank you
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
very much uh questions from the
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent McDonald thank
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for being here
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
today you mentioned that if this were to
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
pass you'd like some amendments one of
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
them would to be exclude um Collective
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
bargained employees or union
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
members um I understand there's two
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
unions here today so maybe they would
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
better answer that but how would you
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
estimate what percentage or how many
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
teachers are represented by unions or
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
would that exclude perhaps a large
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of teachers if that was
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
amended I want to get back to you on the
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
exact number a significant portion of
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
our faculty particularly full-time
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
faculty are represented okay and then
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um a followup go ahead um
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that if this were to pass
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
as is you'd have to to reopen up to
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
eight separate Union contracts to rework
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
those um representative cordelli
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there is perhaps proposed
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
changes to Federal due process laws
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
would you have to open up these Union
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
contracts anyway because of the federal
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
changes my understanding is federal
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
Title 9 establishes a floor right now
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
what is in our collective bargaining
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
agreements is above that floor and I
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
should actually to that thank you for
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
for also reminding me that I think for
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
the most part our conduct folks on our
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
campuses would suggest that right now in
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
most cases with the exception of
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
reprimands when it comes to Serious
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
infractions the due process that we
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
offer particularly our students is well
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
above what is outlined in the bill um so
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
again it's it's forcing us to pay
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
attention to every forcing us to have a
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
similar standard for every potential
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
incident across campus as opposed to
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
Major infractions that would result in
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody being removed or temporarily
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
removed from an institution thank you I
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
got question then I'll go to your
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock um Tom uh within
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
the K through2 realm where we have
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
certified teachers which is different
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
than where you are we also have a code
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh of conduct and there's three tiers
 
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
uh of conduct and there's three tiers
their

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
reprimand suspension revocation of their
 
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
reprimand suspension revocation of their
teaching

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
ticket um within the the eight unions
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that there is
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
reference to this process uh is it a
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
tiered system such as that we have one
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
within the code conduct code of conduct
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
for a person that's certified or do you
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
have any of those that that may be
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
available for us to look at yeah I I
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
would like to go back and actually get
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
you exactly the documentation I I'm
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
going to venture to Guess that they are
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
different whether you're talking about
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the you know the adjunct Union perhaps
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
at Keen State versus you know the full
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
faculty Union at Plymouth State um with
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
eight different agreements there's eight
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
different ways to sort of think about
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
these pieces okay and this I'm sure
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
would be sort of similar to what's going
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
on in the community college I don't know
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
you don't re represent them but uh we're
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to have Shannon Shannon had signed
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
up yeah so okay thank you represent
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman lad you may
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
have answered my question actually your
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
last comment Mr C just just for my own
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
clarification uh when you're speaking
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
today you're speaking on behalf of unh
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
or of all the four years or of all the
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
four years three four year institutions
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
just State un Plum State okay just the
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
fouryear chair correct okay thank you
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome
 
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome
represent

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
leus thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering why you would
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
have to open up
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the unions when the
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
when the union contracts are you you
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
said Above This in most cases but you
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to for the federal when it's
 
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
above the federal what is the difference
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
between this and the federal our read of
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is it's very prescriptive
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
essentially um it it is very clear on
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
how we should follow what the certain
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
things we should do um and that is one
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
of the biggest challenges it is just
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
very prescriptive okay thank you further
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent bbon uh thank
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just curious um the
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
prompting of this this bill um what is
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
your experience
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
and in Your Capacity have people
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
objected to the process that you
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
currently have in place do you have a
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
lot of complaints about that to my
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge and then since receiving the
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note a few months ago and doing
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
the research on this I I am unaware of
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
somebody saying that the process our due
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
process is not working at the
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
University yeah I fully understand uh
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsors intention of trying to get
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of something that maybe coming
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
from the federal side but I I and I
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
didn't hear in the testimony that it was
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
in reaction to something currently
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
happening at one of our institutions
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question is
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
there a distinction in your process
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
between a written and a verbal reprimand
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
is one a matter of record and the other
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
not it's good question and and again
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of the concern we have here
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
is you know you know a a faculty member
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps telling a student you know you
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
need to start showing up on time or
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
there will be consequences is that a
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
reprimand were unclear versus sure if a
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
student is in violation of again let's
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
use caught with a can of or underage
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
like they would probably have something
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
written and put in into a file at that
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
point and there are steps you could go
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
to essentially Beyond you know
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
University probation for some limited
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
period of time uh depending again on the
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
severity of the violation and that's
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
what our biggest issue here is there's
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's unclear that there's any scale for
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
severity thank you
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
very thank you very much Tom oh
 
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.830 align:start position:0%
very thank you very much Tom oh
represent

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you how does the
 
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you how does the
University

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
University
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
um due process
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
system integrate or I'm thinking not
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
with the court
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
system so we certainly review our uh you
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
know student rules rights
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is one of the key
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
driving documents here regularly um in
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
the event that there are court cases
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
that would change how we've written or
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh Implement certain processes we go
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
back and adjust as a result again I
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
think our policies are strong and we
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
haven't been the uh involved in those
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuits but certainly as things are
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
happening around the country
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
particularly in the first circuit as I
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we're reviewing those cases
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
and if we need to make amendments that's
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we do I hope that partially answers
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
the question not see any other other
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
hand here thank you very much I have
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony which does outline
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
those four
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
items like to call forward Shannon
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
Reed from just that she's in the
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
questions she's not sure he's GNA be
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
here this morning or not okay
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
morning I should know by now Shannon
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
Reed representing the community college
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire nice to see you
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
all um we've signed in an opposition to
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I am here as much in listening
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
mode as um testifying mode because I was
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
interested to know why it was felt that
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill was was
 
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.190 align:start position:0%
this bill was was
necessary

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
um we have comprehensive policies of
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
course that govern both student and
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
employee disciplinary matters and then
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
of course for employees we also have
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
protections that are negotiated and
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
enshrined in Collective barging
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
agreements um I'm not aware of any
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
review of our policies or our practices
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
or our outcomes that have suggested any
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
inadequacy in our current policies and
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
processes again I I was interested to
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
hear representative cordell's
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
introduction to this bill referring to
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
some pending Title 9 changes um but
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
again those are pending and only affect
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
a a particular um piece of the a very
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
broad disciplinary picture so
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I am not an expert on Title 9 policy
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
or indeed our disciplinary procedures we
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
have pages and pages of policy and
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
procedure and and a lot of what I heard
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
introduction are also part of our policy
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
for example the presumption of innocence
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
the requirement for timely
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
notification um for hearings and appeals
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
um the ability to call witnesses so we
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
have a lot of those protections
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
currently in policy this
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill would replace our existing policy
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
and processes and negotiated protections
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
um with a set of different requirements
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
in a new chapter of New Hampshire law
 
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
in a new chapter of New Hampshire law
um

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
again that would require for us
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
essentially a wholesale replacement of
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
what we currently do with new practices
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would have to be learned and taught
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and staffed and institutionalized across
 
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.669 align:start position:0%
and staffed and institutionalized across
our

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
institutions um where I can't say that
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of any problem that would
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
necessitate that significant and Broad
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
change um but likely the largest impact
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
of 1288 would be a significant increase
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the use and cost of legal
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
representation and and I'll refer back
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
to what uh Tom Cronin just said about
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
how this bill seems to Encompass
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
everything from the the most minor
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
offense to the most serious and
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
consequential offense so for example a
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
student noise complaint in a residence
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
hall um
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
um a faculty disciplinary matter that
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
might involve um attendance inadequate
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
attendance that would trigger as I read
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
it the same protections that would also
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
be in place for the the far more serious
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
offenses that could result in separation
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
or some kind of more um serious sanction
 
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
um so the ca to ccsnh could could easily
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
reach a million dollars a year I think
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
in my fiscal note I was um I'm informed
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
by my colleagues I was very conservative
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
in estimating what that might be but
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
given the range of sanctions that would
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
that would put into play um legal
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
representation it would likely be much
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
higher and and the anticipated scope and
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
the number of proceedings that would be
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
subject to these new requirements would
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
very likely create also significant
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
delays before decisions could be reached
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
you know you can imagine the range of
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
activities on a college campus and if
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
all these are now going to be subject to
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
a kind of an enhanced um
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
process then there will likely be um
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
changes in the timetables of resolving
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
these issues uh again we have
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive policies um and and the
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining Provisions um
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
enactment of this bill would remove
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
these matters and these processes from
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the purview of institutional
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
policymaking from the internal evolution
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
of the student code of conduct and from
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
the employee bargaining process um these
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
processes and instruments are designed
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be responsive to to um the college
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
context institutional student and
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
employee needs um and I I provided a
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
couple of of examples um where the the
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
inclusion of reprimand the Le letter of
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
reprimand that kind of low lower level
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
sanction um would would trigger the
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
provisions of
 
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.269 align:start position:0%
provisions of
1288

00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
1288
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
um I I think that most direct change
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be that the institution would need
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
far more involv vent of legal council in
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
procedures that now are handled um not
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
not not typically with attorneys at that
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
lower end of the of the kind of sanction
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
scale um the bill also appears to
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
prevent and this is sort of a a specific
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
and and um a a specific point that might
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
not happen often but the bill also
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
appears to prevent the institution from
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
imposing any type of discipline until
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
the proceedings are completed unless we
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
can show a substantial likelihood of an
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
imminent threat to physical threat
 
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
physical injury or damage to property
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's no allowance for an interim
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
sanction that might um be put in place
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
to provide for to allow the institution
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
to act out of prudence to protect any
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
party other than in the face of the
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
threat of physical injury or property
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
damage and I can think of a situation
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
where um there's been an
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
accusation that might warrant removal of
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
of an individual from the campus for a
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
period of time until an investigation re
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
reveals more of what actually happened
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
there doesn't appear to be the ability
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
to do that interim kind of sanction
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
while something is being kind of um
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
investigated and and figured out um I I
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
I'll just summarize by saying we we
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
believe our existing policy and our
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate protections through
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining are the
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate ways to arrive at a
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
complaint and disciplinary processes
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
that are fair and sound um we are kind
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
of all waiting to see what happens with
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
time 9 um and I would want I would hope
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
to do a Fuller analysis of kind of the
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
conflicting or dep applicative impacts
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
of what happens on the federal side
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
before um something is enacted in stay
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
law so I'm happy to try to take any
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
the community college system
representative

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Reed um I I want to I
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
want to sort of um poke at the um the
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
example you you mentioned earlier about
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe a a noise complaint and and you
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
know I think maybe anybody that's that's
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
gone to college or has had um children
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
in college have um have been aware of
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
maybe um uh you know a noise complaint
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
or two and um uh in
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
the I
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
guess with the with the policy with the
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
proposed policy that's before us right
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
now um if there were something like a
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
noise complaint maybe um you know a room
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
two doors down from my daughter's room
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
is uh there they're up late making a lot
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
of noise um and my daughter's trying to
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
study would
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
um how would that be how would the ra
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
handle that now and how would it most
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
likely be handled under you know if if
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
if you know you had to comply with this
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
sort of one- siiz fits-all I I I'm
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
actually not 100%
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
sure how that would be handled under
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
under this bill something like that
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
there would be certainly attempts to
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
come up with an informal resolution
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
right um a more serious but in the same
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
kind of universe type of thing would be
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
if a student propped open a door of a
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
residence hall to allow someone in later
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
because they keep losing their access
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
card or something like that that's a
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
little bit more serious um not so much a
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
kind of student down the hall type of an
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
issue but more of a uh more of a safety
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
issue um there is an attempt made to
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
come up with an informal you know
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
resolution to sort of mediate that I
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
think that under this bill that kind of
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
thing would be um you know the the
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
student could have um an attorney
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
representing him or her cross-examining
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um something that seems
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to the level of offense so
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
our policies right now are are are kind
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
of stepped along the spectrum of colle
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
activity and and potential sanction and
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we feel that that's that is the
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to address the range of
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
things that can happen on a college
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
campus okay thank
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
coming to testify uh given the Title
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
Nine changes are probably coming um is
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill fixable I mean if you took
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
into account reprimand like um UNH was
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
asking and bargaining
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
and perhaps interim measures is it is it
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
something worth working on to um to set
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
the ground for that I I'm sure on the
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
one hand that tweaks or adjustments
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
could be made to the bill so that it
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
would be it would constitute of an
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate set of policies I think my
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
is requiring the institution to hold to
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
to essentially replace an existing and
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
known set of of rules and procedures
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
with something new is in itself a a
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
major undertaking and I I would say
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
there needs to be good reason to do that
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
a problem and inadequacy and I'm not
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
aware that that there is in this case a
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
significant Gap or problem or abuse or
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
inadequacy in how we're presently set up
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
to handle disciplinary matters okay
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Shannon I have a question to
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
not it to you um years ago we had an
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
issue with one of the private
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
institutions in this state where there
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
was sexual misconduct going on and it
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
came down to the
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
investigation do you do the
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
investigation or do you work with as a
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
result of that previous case we dealt
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
with an mou was put in place between the
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
local police in that particular
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
community and the University or college
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
um do you have something like that in
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
place right now to investigate the
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
situations may come up and where is this
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
stop start and stop between you doing it
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then the local authorities doing it
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
I would say that anything that that is a
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
potential criminal offense is reported
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
to local law enforcement and it's dealt
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
with separately in in in the ways that
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
are set up through the criminal the
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
um likely such an incident would also be
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
a violation of a student code of conduct
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
or uh employment rules and it would
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
be dealt with um concurrently in that
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
way but informed by what happens in the
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
in the extra institutional or the legal
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
realm does does that make sense did that
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question well I
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to be able to
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
get the answer in this one without a lot
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
more discussion uh in the case I'm
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
talking about we had the college taking
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
care of some of these issues which were
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
clearly on the other side of the coin in
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
the criminal area and um and the town
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know anything about it I'm not
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with the example you're I'm
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth okay and it had to be resolved
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
by the attorney in Grafton
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
County so I I just asked that question
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
see if there's something like this in
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
place where you know where this the
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
where the line is that you so there's a
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
due process afforded to the
 
00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.309 align:start position:0%
due process afforded to the
student

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and if the student decides that if
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's a disciplinary action taken by
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
the college or the institution yours is
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
there a process where the student say no
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
I want to take this you know in a
 
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.589 align:start position:0%
I want to take this you know in a
different

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
direction yeah I'm not sure I'm going to
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that right now I I I
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
got you any further qu represent
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman L good
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
morning welcome um just to clarify my
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
own misinformation probably I'm thinking
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
of Community College uh students for the
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
most part being generally a little older
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
a little more mature um so and I may be
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
wrong that I'm thinking different
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
different uh demographic of youngsters
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
or young adults that go there um what is
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
the ballp breakdown guesstimation on
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
High School age type students that go
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
versus older 10 I'm trying to think of
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
and that's just want in the second part
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
of that same question uh how many do you
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
have ballpark that we you actually have
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
residential settings if you may sure
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um I thank you uh the the
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
demographic of our students is in fact
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
indeed broad as you suggest we have
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
about um 60% of our students who are
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
under age 25 and 40% that are over age
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
25 Bas roughly um in residents we only
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
have two colleges right now that have
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
residential students nhg and conquered
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
which has about 300 students who live in
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
campus dorms and uh Lakes Region
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
Community College in theonia which has
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
kind of adjacent housing that houses
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
students and thank you just to follow up
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
to that residential number how many then
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
a non-residential you're looking at
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe 400 finder there in your whole
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
system community college system roles um
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
how many actual roles that give my
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
answer right we I mean all in we serve
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
about 21,000 students a year significant
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
proportion of those though about 8,000
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
are still in high school okay and
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're taking dual credit courses
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
through us so you know roughly an FTE on
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
um a credit FTE of about 12,000 students
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
and under 500 are res very small number
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
laus would would the community college
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
need to revamp things if the federal law
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
does go into effect I'm sure there would
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
be some adjustments on the Title Nine
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
side okay thank
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you if there's no more
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions we'll call forward uh
 
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
questions we'll call forward uh
represent

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
Len

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
the committee uh um I I guess what i'
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do I I think
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli sort of uh in
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
his introduction sort of explained
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
generally the bill but you've had a
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
number of questions and I i' like what
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try to do is is
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
respond um uh to the questions and I I
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
hope I'm doing this in in the in roughly
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
the order that they were raised there
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
was initially a question about whether
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of faculty member uh
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
where it
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
says uh means full-time or part-time
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
member and I think the question was
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
would that cover an adjunct I mean
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
obviously it would be up to the
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
committee if you thought it it shouldn't
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
my inclination was that it should that
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
it would cover it would cover you know
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
at a part that by part-time I meant to
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
include adjuncts um there was another
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
question uh uh about uh probationary
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
status and that's a very good question I
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
mean maybe that means that the language
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
would need to be changed my intention
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
was not to cover somebody that's on
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
probationary status because they've been
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
subject to some kind of discipline but
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
rather I meant somebody that I assume
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a process when you if you
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
first get hired that for some period of
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
time you're on you're on uh you know
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're on probation that's the kind of
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
probation I meant but but you rais a
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
very good question maybe maybe that
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed to say you know is
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
on a new high or some language like that
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's that that's what I intended um
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
then the the the
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
the other uh issue and I I very much
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the representatives from the
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
from uh the university system and the
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
community college system being here
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
because I think they rais some good
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
points for example um the question about
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
reprimand um should that be covered I
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's they they rais some good points
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
on that I think your your point
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative luno about you know
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's the loud somebody's yelling
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the dorm or making a loud noise you
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
want to have invoke all of the full due
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
process uh areas here I I would tend to
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
agree if it's just something as simple
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
as that you know maybe maybe that's not
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
required so
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
maybe I I guess what I would suggest is
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
it may not be as as simple as simply
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
removing reprimand from the language
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
because my sense is that there may be
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
reprimands and then there are reprimands
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
if you know if you've if uh if you were
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know you were intoxicated some
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
night on a Friday night and you were and
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
you were making too much noise in the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
dorms um and they you know they said to
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
you you know cut it out don't do that
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
again or you know you're uh impose some
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
very minor kind of uh consequence for
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe shouldn't be something that
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
is uh covered by by a sort of a full due
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
process on the other hand what I would
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
be concerned about is if if we if you
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
completely remove reprimand
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
altogether um could there be serious
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
reprimands that if if they were not if
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
they could be imposed without due uh
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
affording due process
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
that could be used
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
as um as a method uh to really very
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
badly D damage someone's reputation um
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
in other words if for example
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
suppose um suppose that there were an
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
allegation of some kind of sexual
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
assault which if true would be a really
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
serious matter that somebody should uh
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who would committed that should
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
be you know maybe should be expelled or
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
or or or whatever um but the but the
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
evidence was not sufficient to sort of
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
support actually doing that and so in an
 
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.750 align:start position:0%
support actually doing that and so in an
effort

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
to uh in an effort to avoid having to
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
make a hard decision the institution
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
decide well we'll just impo we'll just
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
we'll just issue a letter of reprimand
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
here we don't have to go through all the
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
all the uh the due process standards
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
that that I think would be a concern so
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm suggest in is maybe
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
there there is there is some Middle
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
Ground here where you might say you know
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
a uh a reprimand a written reprimand for
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
example that would be permanently a part
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
of someone's student file or something
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
like that I I'm I'm just you know
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
thinking off the top of my head here but
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
I would think that you it might not be
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate simply to remove all uh
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
reference to a repr man it's if you
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
could in some way sort of change the
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
language and I would obviously be happy
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
to work with any members of the
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee on this to to to make it clear
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
that what you were talking about is sort
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
of a serious reprimand something that
 
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
was pretty serious um and that could
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
have lasting sort of reputational uh
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
consequences on the person then it would
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
seem to me the person ought to be
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
entitled to Due Process now with regard
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
to the issue that was raised
 
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.069 align:start position:0%
to the issue that was raised
about

00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
um collective bargaining membership and
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
you know and the need to change all of
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
the of of uh collective bargaining
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
agreements that kind of thing um I think
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
several of you raised very good
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
questions to the witness who testified
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
in that regard and I think if you
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
listened carefully to what he said in
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
the end it seemed like he really sort of
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
came around to saying well really maybe
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
there really isn't such a big this isn't
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
such a big deal after all
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like most of the
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements that
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and I have to say I
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't reviewed those
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements I don't
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
know what they say but it sounded like
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
if I was listening corre correctly to
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
what he said is that most of those
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
Encompass the due process that rights
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here maybe not
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
every single one of them but but it
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
sounded like most of them do uh
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
substantially in uh incorporate those
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
kind of due process rights and I would
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
note in that regard please don't forget
 
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
to look at uh proposed RSA 188 j4 on
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
page three of the bill that indicates um
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm quoting now any New Hampshire
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
Public institution of higher education
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
May adopt rules regulations policies or
 
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
procedures that afford students student
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
organizations or faculty members more
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
due process protections that are that
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
are provided in this but None Shall None
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
Shall uh afford less due process so if
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
as I as it seemed to me um the Witnesses
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
were saying the collective bargaining
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
agreements do contain due process that
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
are basically equivalent now I'm not
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
saying that they might not have to
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
change one or two little things but um
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
but as as they uh seem to acknowledge it
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
would seem that they may have to do that
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
in light of Title 9 changes anyway so
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
would they would it might they have to
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments Pro perhaps but it
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
seems like most of the you know I I
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
would expect that the that the um the
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
people representing the uh the union
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
side of negotiations obviously are very
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerned to make sure that they're that
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
the people they represent have due
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
process protections so I would suspect
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
that many of those are close maybe not
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
exactly the same but pretty close um to
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
what to what is uh what is provided for
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
here so I I really don't think that
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's likely to be um a huge issue and
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
remember that there are there are many
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
people that are not covered by the
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements that
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
could could easily be be subjected to uh
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
to some form of disciplinary action
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
um the last uh I I I the last point I
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh respond to and then I'm
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
obviously happy to answer any questions
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
you may have is the question about um
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
should this bill apply to to
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that sought
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
approval um and I guess I think I mean I
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
think that does that that that there is
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
a legitimate concern there if the you
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
know if some institu if some
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
group um sought a
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
approval uh for their group and for one
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
reason or another they were denied of
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know I I mean I um I'm not
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this would happen but it
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
could you know just take take an obvious
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
example suppose that the that the The
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
Faculty at UNH says oh it's fine to have
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh the young Republicans Club on uh on
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
UNH on the UNH campus but we can't have
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
the young Democratic Club um shouldn't
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
they and we're not going to recognize it
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be able to say wait a
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
minute what are you what are you talking
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
about we have a we of course we we have
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
a right to do this you allow or suppose
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
you know to maybe maybe a less subtle
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
example suppose the uh uh the you know
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
the the UNH group every day uh every
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
every person for gun safety or something
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
they get recognized but there's a um you
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
know a a uh Pro Second Amendment group
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
that wants to be recognized and they're
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
not shouldn't they have the right to be
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh to say wait a minute you you can't uh
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
you can't do this you have we have we
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
have a right to recognition also so I do
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
think that there's a reason why uh
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
groups that are seeking
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
recognition um should have uh should
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
have the protections of this bill um and
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
I guess the very last point I'll make a
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
response to the the testimony of the um
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
person from the community college system
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
um about you know are there's
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which we need to remove
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
someone we we want to be able to take
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
some action like removing someone from
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
campus before there's a
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
hearing uh I certainly can see
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
situations where that might be
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate but it would seem to me that
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
it would be that in the circumstances in
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
which it would be appropriate there
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be some basis of saying there's
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of you know it's dangerous to
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
keep this person on campus um and I
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
think that the the exception for that is
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh is contained in the bill if there's
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
If there really is some a basis for
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
believing that there's some physical
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
danger to the to other students or
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
faculty or whatever um or some danger to
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
property of course the the the
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
institution should be able to uh to
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
remove the student before year but if
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the case your M just went off
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry but if that's not the
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
case then I don't think um that they
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
should be able to you know I think that
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
the student should be afforded the
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
hearing first so with with that um I'm
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
very much representa representative
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr jiren thank you for
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
being here for this testimony thank you
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
for presenting this bill uh on the whole
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
I certainly agree with the concept maybe
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
a few portions could use cleaning up I
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a couple concerns I hope you could
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
speak to um however page two lines 15
 
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.950 align:start position:0%
speak to um however page two lines 15
and

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
16 uh the right against self
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
incrimination except that invocation of
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
this right May afford a basis for the
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
decision maker to draw an adverse
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
inference against the person who does do
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
you think there might be cause there for
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
concern that there could become a
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
coercive environment for proceedings or
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
investigation if there is allowed to be
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
a negative infant drawn from somebody
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
invoking their right to remain silent
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
well you know what I would say I I put
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
that in because remember these these
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings are not criminal are not
 
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings it's a u these are
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know for a lack of a better term
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
these would fall under the the broad
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
General category of civil kind of
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
sanctions that would be imposed and
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
there is a sort of recognized body of
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
case law that says in the civil law
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
context a a person still has the right
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
to invoke the privilege of
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination because to because
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
potentially there could be a criminal
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know criminal charge could be
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
brought but in the Civil context it is
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
generally uh permissible for um the
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
FactFinder to draw an adverse inference
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I put that
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
in is there
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
some potential for
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
some potential for
coercion

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I suppose you could make that
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
argument I would tend to think that it
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
might you know that on the whole um it
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's not this is not a bad idea I guess
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way I'd answer thank you and
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
if I if I may real uh real quick because
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
that was the perfect segue into the the
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
other question I had and I'm not sure
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's specifically addressed in here I'm
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
hoping you can speak to whether or not
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
it would touch on it we've seen I have
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
seen elsewhere um and our chairman
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
brought up an example of this um the
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
idea of a criminal allegation being
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated at a uh at a college
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
obviously there's colleges exist in this
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
gray area where they have to have
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings but they have
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
not been established as courts by this
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body so my my inference
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
there with they is that they may have to
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
take disciplinary action but they have
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
no right to adjudicate guilt in a
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
criminal matter so would would that be
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
something that this this bill has
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
anything to do with or if not do you
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
think that might be an appropriate uh
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
addition to this bill to preclude the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
adjudication of guilt just guilt in
 
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.150 align:start position:0%
adjudication of guilt just guilt in
criminal

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
allegations well I think I mean the the
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
the only the only place that criminal
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
guilt can be adjudicated is in a court
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't think that you know
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
this there certainly could be
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
overlapping I mean you know Behavior
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
could constitute both a crime that could
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted by the county attorney or
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General in court and also
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
be the basis for disciplinary action um
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
in uh by the university system or
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
community college system um and I don't
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
think this is intended to cover criminal
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
conduct I and I don't think I don't
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
think the university system would have
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
the authority to you know to adjudicate
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
guilt in the sense of like you're guilty
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
and we're imposing some criminal
 
00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.109 align:start position:0%
and we're imposing some criminal
punishment

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you yes represent
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
Cordell thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question it is again in
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
regards to that same part I had uh my
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
last question about adjuncts line 17 on
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
page one but this part it this uh ex
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
exception does not include a faculty
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
member who is in probationary status
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
could you speak to why you have included
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
that and um you've
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
already clarified that this is in
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
regards to a new more so a new employee
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
rather than someone who is on probation
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
for like doing something bad um are they
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
not also entitled to do process so if
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
you could speak to why you have put this
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
exception in there and if perhaps it is
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
not necessary sure I you know I um
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
certainly in terms of is it NE I mean
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
could you take it out you you and so so
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
that so that everybody including sort of
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
brand new employees would be would be
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
subject to the due process protection
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes you could um I put it in there
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
because I guess you know I I do agree
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the uh with with the prior
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who testified I I'm not you
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
know I I understand that there is an
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
Institutional interest in in limiting
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
the number of hearings that that you
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
know that that this can be a that that
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
impose imposing these requirements and
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
requiring hearings can be a burden um I
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
and so I I just sort of assumed and I
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
think my inclination I could be wrong on
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
this and maybe somebody would would
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
correct me if I am but for example even
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
in most collective bargaining agreements
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
I think that there is often a um an
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
exception uh that that all the rights
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
that that a a union member has don't
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
kick in until they've served a certain
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
period of time and so it was along those
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
same lines that I thought that it made
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
sense to exclude people that were you
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
know were new employees basically on on
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
probation but again do you have to do
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
that no you could you could cover them
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
too but I think you do you then impose a
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
sort of Greater burden of perhaps more
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
hearings on on the institution and
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
that's why I did not put that in further
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
questions represent luno
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you judge
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning um in your
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
in your opinion um what are the problems
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
with the current University and
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
Community College
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
policies well I guess you know I would
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
say this I I think my understanding and
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
I want you to understand I have you know
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
I have this isn't something that I've
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know deeply researched but from what
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
I've from what I understand based upon
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
what I've read in you know various
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
newspapers various Publications the
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
university system I think the the the
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
state college system is generally not
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
bad in terms of compared for compared
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
for example to private institutions such
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
as Dartmouth where you know Free Speech
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh free speech on Dartmouth is uh is at
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
a premium uh it is less so I think in
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
the in the university in the in the uh
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
in the University system the state
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
colleges but I I as representative
 
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.910 align:start position:0%
colleges but I I as representative
cordelli

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
explained um there is a very great
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
concern I think that
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
um starting with the with the Obama
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
Administration and and what you know
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
bear in mind what what um the way much
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
of the of the
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
um the proposals that were uh submitted
 
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.349 align:start position:0%
um the proposals that were uh submitted
and

00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
implemented uh during the Obama
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
Administration in this
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
area um it's not even clear that they
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
actually were buy were sort of valid
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
regulations they would the the Secretary
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
of Education would send out you know
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
dear uh Dear John kind of letters
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
proposing sort of guidance that weren't
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
really uh proposed as regulations they
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
were guidance so your guidance is you
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
don't really um you uh you don't really
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to have much in the way of due
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
process when somebody's accused of uh of
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
having sexually assaulted someone else
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
that's not very it's it's much more
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
important to um to provide Comfort to
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
the person who has allegedly been
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
wronged than it is to afford due process
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
to somebody who's been accused and so
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
you had this
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
guidance um suggesting you should do
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
this and candidly because most of the
 
01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:51.390 align:start position:0%
this and candidly because most of the
institutions

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
um shared the uh the the philosophical
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
Outlook of the of uh of the of the of
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
what was being proposed by the Biden
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
Administration most of them did they
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
adopted oh yes we're going to do this
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
and then when the when the secretary
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
DeVos came in and and and and change
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
that um uh institutions did some
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
institutions did adopt did you know
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
adopt what the what secretary devvo said
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
um imposing more uh more stringent due
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
process protections uh and now there is
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
this concern that we're going to you
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
know turn the clock back uh with some
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
proposals that have been made uh by the
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration and so I think that
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
having a state law that
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
says this is you can't do this this is
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done because there bear
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
in mind there is real real questions and
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
I think to the extent that these issues
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
have have been adjudicated I think in
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
particular there was a case from the
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
seventh circuit if I recall when Justice
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
Barrett was still a Circuit Judge um
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
that really raised questions about
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
whether the uh the federal government
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
had under the Education Act actually had
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
the authority to issue these quote
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
unquote guidance um
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh letters um but but the my purpose
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
basically was to ensure that due process
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
is protected
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire uh regardless of
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
what uh guidance or other uh proposals
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
might be issued by um this current the
 
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.309 align:start position:0%
might be issued by um this current the
current

01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
Administration just quick file we do
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
have one more person to testify okay but
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
no but uh judge Lyn would be the person
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
of um ask this so so given what you just
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
um talked about and and in particular um
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
U very prescriptive due process
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions versus maybe less
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
prescriptive due process Provisions I
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
was wondering what what how you think um
 
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the comments from the
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
former president of Harvard um may have
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
have may have been impacted by a more
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
proscriptive uh due process um
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
policy such as this how they may have
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
been I'm not I'm not frankly I'm not
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
quite sure I'm really I'm really getting
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
at at is there a point with which um um
 
01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
with with which a prescriptive due
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
process policy would would prevent the
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
college president from being able to um
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
to make a a specific um call on um on uh
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
behavior on
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
campus yeah to make a specific call I
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
well no I don't I mean I don't think so
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
in other words if a if a for example if
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
a if to you what to get out what I think
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
you're sort of suggesting is this if a
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
if a college President were
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
to um were to take disciplinary action
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
against some students for example for
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
engaging in anti-semitic Behavior
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
please understand on the merits of that
 
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
if they in fact did that uh should you
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
know and should there be disciplinary
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
action um uh I I would obviously
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
depending on the facts I would tend to
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
say absolutely
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
but it's like you know it's like
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
anything else that it depends on the
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
facts and I don't think that the that if
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
the students say wait a minute I didn't
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
do what you've alleged that I did or
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
you've you've really overstated what
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
happened here I think that the students
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
you know whoever they are whether
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're you know uh whoever they are
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
should have the right to have their
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
their a fair hearing and so you know if
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
that if
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
that due process
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
always in fact it's meant to it
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
always uh restrains someone who who
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
would like to act right now and impose
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
their will it always restricts them from
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
doing that um and that's you know that's
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what due process is all
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
about it's to make sure that we don't
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
act precipitously that we that we find
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
out what the what really happened and
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
listen to and give the person who's
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
accused the opportunity to have their
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
day in court for lack of a better term
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
or day of for a hearing before you take
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
some precipitous action and I think
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important to do
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
that further questions thank you very
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization dedicated to
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
protecting the free speech and due
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
process rights of students and faculty
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
at our nation's institutions of higher
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
education through throughout its nearly
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
25 year history fire has defended
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
students and faculty on all parts of the
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum we have also
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
advocated for campus due process
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in state houses across the
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
country we are pleased to see that a
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
campus due process bill was introduced
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this bill will enshrine
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
important protections for college
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
students into state law such as the
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
express presumption of innocence and the
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
right to active assistance of council I
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
hope we can all agree that before a
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
student is removed from the College of
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
their choice and possibly have their
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
entire educational careers ruined for
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
allegations of wrongdoing universities
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
must follow Fair policies and procedures
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they get the ultimate
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
decision right as many court cases
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
across the country have shown it is
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately common for universities to
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
for universities to sidestep many of
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
these protections when they are not
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
expressly guaranteed in
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
law however this bill would benefit from
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
crucial amendments most importantly the
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
provision of the right to remain silent
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
being invoked by the accused can be
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
construed against the accused must be
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
removed since most of the incidents
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
these college um displ disciplinary
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings May overlap with potential
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
criminal law proceedings the choice that
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
remain silent and campus proceedings may
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
be advisable it should not cut cut
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
against students who may be taking
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
advice from a defense attorney this
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
provision is also in conflict with
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
existing Federal Town n rules which
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit institutions from drawing
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
inferences against either a complainant
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
or respondent based on their silence
 
01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:15.269 align:start position:0%
or respondent based on their silence
during

01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
cross-examination further We Believe
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
other Provisions would benefit from
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity or sub or substantive
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
additions fire has model legisl
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
portions of which have been enacted in
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
nine states in fact over the past two
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
years in Arkansas Louisiana and Kentucky
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
such legislation has been passed
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
unanimously it has been signed into law
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
by both Democratic and Republican
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
Governors I would urge the committee to
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at those pieces of
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and our model to shore up
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and ensure students in New
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have the best possible
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
protections uh thank you um actually
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
before I finish um uh we also had the uh
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
very similar concerns with many others
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to the word Rand uh in this
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill um so you know looking to making
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
changes in that um can certainly
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
invisable and something that we would be
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
interested in working with the committee
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
on as well uh for instance our Mall
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it focuses on um on
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
infractions that would uh result in
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
suspensions of 10 days um or more or an
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
expulsion um and we do that because
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's in uh keeping with Supreme Court
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
president in Lopez Vos which said that
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
in you know um situations where a
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
student's education uh could result in
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
um like I said a suspension in 10 days
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
or more or an expulsion that's when due
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
process is necessary uh so that's why we
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
have that in our U Mall piece of
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
legislation but of course you can do
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
much um go further than that of course
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh but we understand that reprimand is
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
certainly an issue that can be looked at
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
in this bill so much any questions
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Gonzalez for uh
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
for being with us here this morning I
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could um uh you
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
know let us know currently how or I
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
guess where are univers our state
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
universities stand in terms of their
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
rating with your organization uh so in
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the due process realm I would have to
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
really uh take a look at the uh policies
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
but you know um um you know off the top
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
of my head I can't remember any
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
particular issues with the current due
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
process um uh language I but I will say
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
that you know you for this type of of
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
issue you don't want to wait till
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
there's a problem right um you know
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are plenty core cases across the
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
land where there are universities who
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
thought you know they they came and said
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
that they were doing the right things
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
all along when in reality they were not
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
um you have cases where there's no um
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
you know there's no uh live hearing for
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
instance which actually this bill does
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
not actually have so that's another
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
change that we would we would welcome to
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was um an actual live hearing
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
so you would just have um investigators
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
take some statements and then they would
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
end up being the kind of Judge juring
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
exe executioner representative cordelli
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the return to the single
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
investigator model which is possible
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
with these new tile 9 uh pending tile 9
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
regulations so um that could happen if
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
um if legislation isn't enacted um it's
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
not it won't be necessarily mandated uh
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the new tile n regulations they
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
usually say you know they may kind of do
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
this um but in during the like Obama
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
administration that's exactly what
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
universities were doing they're allowing
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
the single investigator investigator
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
model to go forward so you know while
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
there may not be any issues right now
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
you don't want to wait for students to
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
be essentially railroad out of college
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
for that to have for changes to be made
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
follow up yes Mr chair how about with um
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
the University's um uh ratings on um
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
Fire's um speech on
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
campus uh so uh
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
I we know it's high like fourth in the
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
country but we that's the next bill no I
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
I I understand that but but clearly
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
there'd be a relationship between um
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
your policies on speech and campus and
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
and your your policies with respect to
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
um to to what the subject of this bill
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
is so uh so you you it would be
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
inconceivable to have policies that were
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
180 degrees out of sync with with each
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
other uh on that so so just to be able
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
to since since since you don't have the
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
information on um and we haven't been
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
able to find any any get any testimony
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
on information about any current
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
problems with unh's due process policies
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
let's let's swing over to what what what
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
will often behavior that will that could
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
result in due process and talk about um
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
um that behavior and where where are um
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
university uh colleges
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
universities uh stand with respective
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
fires rating on that yeah so um you know
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're we are happy to say that UNH is
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
currently ranked number three in fires
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh campus free spre rankings number
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
three number three out of
 
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
246 okay universities uh rated now that
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they have a perfect
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
score uh their score is about I believe
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
72 uh so I believe um that's a c in most
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh grading scales so um I I believe that
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh anyone that's gain a c has certainly
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
improve they do a good job at UNH yeah
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
let's just put that in in the minutes
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
much and with that this closes the
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
testimony for the bill we're on 1288 and
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
we will shortly get into the next bill
 
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
we will shortly get into the next bill
which

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody on the committee that has
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
to take a break do so and don't be
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
bashful doing they when we're having the
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
minutes I think have to leave um a
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
little longer I um going through
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
the um I'm going to have to leave up
 
01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.870 align:start position:0%
the um I'm going to have to leave up
this

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
1436 and then
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
only from the legislative view advisory
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
counil yeah you just said put them
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
towards the end
 
01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
James there he
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
is good thank you that
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:05.890 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:23:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm Representative Bob Lyn
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
from wendam and I'm a one of the
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of uh of this bill um and I
 
01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.189 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of uh of this bill um and I
guess

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
um again I think the bill I'm happy to
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
answer uh questions if I can I think the
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill is relatively um straightforward it
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
is designed to uh guarantee that uh Free
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
Speech rights are
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
protected um in institutions of uh
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
public uh higher
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
education um and that um you know it's
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
designed to Pro uh for example to
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit the establishment of you know
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
sort of free speech Zone some narrow
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
location where free speech is allowed
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
but everywhere else it's not allowed
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
just as an example um it's uh it's uh
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
designed um to prevent
 
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
designed um to prevent
um

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh other sort of intrusions if you will
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
on uh on on uh free speech uh on
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
campuses uh while also allowing the the
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
institutions to maintain reasonable time
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
place and Mana restrictions that that I
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
think that that does have to exist and
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
it it is provided for in in the bill
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm happy to take any
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of the
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative not seeing thank you very
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
you uh I'd like to have uh
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
Muller

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to ask to uh close
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
the you know discussion I would like an
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak at the end rather
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
than now if possible I I can put you at
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
the it's been introduced so if you'd
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
rather speak at the end that your I
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
Mr okay we' like to have uh next then
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
you well thank you so much my name is
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
Lance kinzer I'm here on behalf of First
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment partnership I have some
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps now I was here last year in in
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
February on a very similar bill and I
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
know the the committee is uh well
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
advised on most of this bill has had an
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear testimony before has
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to discuss the bill
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to focus really
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
briefly on just a couple of things that
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I hope will refresh your recollection
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
on the the purpose and kind of the
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but also provide a
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of an update and my area of
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
expertise to the extent that I have any
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
is really on the Student Association
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill that portion of the
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
bill that protects the ability of
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
student associations to choose leaders
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
who agree with the mission and purpose
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
and agree to live consistently with the
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
mission and purpose of the organization
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
this issue has has resulted in a
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
significant amount of litigation over
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
the past several years perhaps most
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
dramatically in Iowa where ultimately in
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
2022 the US Circuit Court of Appeals for
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
the eth circuit found that uh targeting
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
of religious groups not allowing them to
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
choose their own leaders based upon
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
their the religious views of those
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
organizations um with such an egregious
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
violation of of wellestablished
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that the
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
university administrators who had made
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that decision uh did not have qualified
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
immunity were actually personally liable
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh in that case
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
for one of the groups that was involved
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
in that litigation and that's been
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
involved in in much of the litigation in
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
this area a and even angelical campus
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
ministry called intervarsity and I think
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see they weren't able to be here
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
today in person but I believe they
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
provided already some testimony online
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
and the point that I want to make about
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is that um in instances where these
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues are litigated um it's
 
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
increasingly the case that student
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
associations who are forced to litigate
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
over these issues are winning uh they're
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
winning in dramatic fashion and they're
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
even winning some pretty big judgments
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the University of Iowa case
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of Iowa were ultimately on
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
the hook for a $2 million judgment
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
approximately that they ended up paying
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
out but in Varsity uh although they can
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
win these lawsuits doesn't want to be
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
involved in lawsuits it's a distraction
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
from their mission and what they're
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
advocating for and what we're here
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of today is really an
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to limit litigation by
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
establishing clear standards that are
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way courts have more
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
more been interpreting what the
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution has to say about the right
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
of student associations to choose their
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
leaders um consistent with the views of
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
those groups and that and that leads me
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
to the the kind of update from last year
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
most recently there was a case in the US
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court of Appeals for the ninth
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
circuit involving Fellowship of
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
Christian athletes versus the San Jose
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
Unified School District now that's
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
obviously by the case title A K12 case
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
not a higher ed case but in that case
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
the ninth circuit sitting on Bonk as an
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
entire court went out of their way to
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
say we're going to go back and clarify
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
our circuit's precedent on highered
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
issues related to student associations
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
because the direction the US Supreme
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
Court's been going on this issue is so
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
clear and so the ninth circuit ruled and
 
01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
I think this is really the key because
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
often times the distinction has been
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
that let's say we have a you know we
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
have religion as a protected class and a
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
religious group wants to have religious
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
standards for their organization a
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
religious campus ministry and sometimes
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's been confusion well is it
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
religious discrimination for a religious
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
group to have religious standards for
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
its leaders and unfortunately that's
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
kind of at the core of a lot of the
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
litigation and the ninth circuit
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with some rulings of the US
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said very clearly
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
recently in the in the the higher ed
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
context anti-discrimination laws and the
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
protections of the Constitution work in
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
tandem to protect minority views in the
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
face of dominant public opinion just as
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
it makes sense in that case for the
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
senior Women's Club to have all female
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
members um just as it makes sense for
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
certain clubs to require good moral
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
conduct of their members it makes equal
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
sense that a religious group be allowed
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
to require that its leaders agree with
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
the group's most fundamental beliefs the
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
ninth circuit revised their their
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
circuit precedent to make this more
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
clear my point that I want to make and
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'll leave you with this is that the the
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
Student Association portion of this bill
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
which locks in the ability of student
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
associations to have standards for
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
leaders it's particularly important for
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
belief-based organizations it's been
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
especially problematic for number of
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
religious organizations the design the
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
intent the heart of that provision that
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
17 states have passed including Indiana
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
unanimously including Louisiana where
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
Democratic governor signed it into law
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
is to avoid litigation to create a clear
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
standard so that um un so that students
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to retain legal counsel sue
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
their own universities you'll recall
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
from last year um that there was a a
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
group from first Liberty the Christian
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
legal society that came in and testified
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
about issues they had had at the law
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
school I believe you'll be receiving
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony from both of those
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
groups providing a bit of an update but
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer questions I just
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
want to say I believe that what we have
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
in this bill is a codification of the
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
direction courts are rapidly moving on
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
what the legal standards are and that by
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
having this inst statute clear the
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
result will be less less likelihood of
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
litigation more clarity for
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
administrators more clarity for student
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
groups and it's really promotive of
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
pluralism and so that's why we're here
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of it today thank you
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
very much I do have a question for you
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
yes sir um where does the First
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment start and stop here in regard
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
to True threats expression directed to
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
provoke imminent Lawless actions and
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
like likely to produce
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
it prohibiting harassment as expressed
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
directly to uh let's see prohibiting
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
harassment as defined in RSC 188 Etc I'm
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
concerned where does where does the the
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
line is there a line there where you're
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
you're you're the way you're expressing
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
yourself the freedom of speech leads to
 
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
yourself the freedom of speech leads to
Lawless

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
Lawless
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
activity and and how is that addressed
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah through the First Amendment so I'll
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
begin by saying that there are a couple
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
people who are going to testify after me
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
particularly the the person from fire
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
who I think has has focused more on that
 
01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill and may be able to
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
give you a better answer but my answer
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
would be that the this area of speech
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
say in relation to incitement is an
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
issue that's been well litigated over
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
the years the courts have established
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
standards regarding um through a host of
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
cases and we really do as we do in many
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
instances look to the case law to see
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
where those lines are drawn and my
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of the the speech zones
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
portion of this bill not the portion
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
that I know as much about but my
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the this bill is that
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's largely intended to recapitulate
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
language that courts have used that
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
courts are familiar with so that when
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
this standard is the standard that's in
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
front of them and these issues are being
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicated they're using very common
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
standards that and using standards that
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
courts are familiar with and so there
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
are some line drawing questions that
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
arise throughout this bill that's not um
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
you know in that's not uncommon with
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
respect to much legislation that gets
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
passed but I think the real benefit of
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation is that it uses
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
language it uses standards that are very
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way courts have
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with these issues in the past
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with them and the real
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
purpose overall of having this just
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
clearly in a state statute is as much as
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
possible to avoid getting to the stage
 
01:33:59.229 --> 01:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
where we have to litigate because the
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
standards are are are relatively clear
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
as clear as we can make them there maybe
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else can give a better answer
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
to that question but that's how I would
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
respond thank you are there questions
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
chair and and uh uh thank you for um for
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
being here Mr kinzer uh to in taking my
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
question um you just um um chair lad
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh was just um touching on page two
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
lines 32 through 35 which is the sort of
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
like the catch all nothing in that se in
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
this section shall be interpreted as
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
preventing uh public institutions from
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
prohibiting you
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
know restriction of
 
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.070 align:start position:0%
know restriction of
expression

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
expression
 
01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.830 align:start position:0%
expression
um

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh that uh that that that touches on
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
true threats directed to provoke
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
imminent Lawless act stuff like that I
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
was wondering how come the um the
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
section on uh the ne the very next
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
section uh Jen 3 freedom of Association
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and non-discrimination why doesn't that
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
have the same um uh same language so my
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that those
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
provisions on actually engaging in
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
speech would apply just as much to
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
speech that occurs in the context of say
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
some associational event as it would
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
apply any place else the the point of
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
the associational protections is not so
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
much about the conduct of the group once
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
they're recognized it's really about
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
what what's the process for the
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
recognition of groups and what standards
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
can universities have in place that
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
would restrict the ability of a group to
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
be recognized as a student Association
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
based upon their Viewpoint or the way in
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
which they go about selecting their
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
leaders and so my reading of the bill is
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to the actual conduct
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
of a group the way in which its members
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
articulate their message doing that on
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
campus the same standards that apply to
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else with respect to speech
 
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
would apply but the associational
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
Protections in terms of group
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
recognition are important because
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of confusion around
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
that issue in universities across the
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
country that's resulted in litigation
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
particularly around the question of can
 
01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.669 align:start position:0%
particularly around the question of can
belief-based

01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
belief-based
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
organizations require their members to
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
share the beliefs that the organization
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
holds and courts are more and more in
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
dramatic fashion saying yes they can and
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
the hope of this provision is not to say
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
once you're recognized as a group it's
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
absolute cart blanch and you can engage
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
in um you know harassing Behavior or or
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior at all nothing about
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
the association provision protects that
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
but it does say that a group that the
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
university can't look at your Viewpoint
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
as you're going through the process of
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
being recognized and saying because we
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
disagree with your Viewpoint or because
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
you we require your leaders you require
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
your leaders to share your Viewpoint
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to recognize you at all
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the the distinction so
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair yes so uh so thank
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
you so take me through this then if
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
um if a uh if if if basically a student
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
organization shall not
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
be sure I uh shall not be denied um any
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
benefit and this is the word from the um
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
the phrase from top of Page Three line
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
one yes don't be denied any benefit or
 
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
privilege available to any other student
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
organization so any B benefit or priv
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
privilege that could be maybe you know
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
500 or $ thousand dollar worth of
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
potentially Student Activity fin support
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a place on campus to Sir to to
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
conduct um that activity and um and uh
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
you know in an organization that that
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
where all of its members and
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
particularly all of its leaders um firm
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
andhere to an organization sincerely had
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
held beliefs what if those sincerely
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
held beliefs were so aboring uh similar
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
to the questions that were asked of
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
President gay uh a few weeks ago down in
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
Washington um would the um would the
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
university then U still have to uh
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
provide that student organization uh
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
space as well as financial support on
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers dime so the law makes
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
a pretty clear distinction between
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
abhorent views and abhorent conduct and
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that I want to
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
communicate here today is the groups
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm here on behalf of are generally
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
speaking Campus Ministries Whose desire
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be on campus relates to um hosting
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
Bible studies involving being involved
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
in in missions projects involved being
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
involved in public service so the and
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
those kinds of groups um consistently
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
have been the groups that are engaged in
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
litigation over the issue of not being
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
able to be recognized as a student group
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
if you go out and look at the litigation
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
that's actually happening in this area
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's really not groups with
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
abhorent views that are are litigating
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
um because there there are all sorts of
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
disincentives to those groups forming in
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
the first place on college campuses but
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
the thing I want to really stress
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
is that going all the way back um to the
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
the early 70s during the the Vietnam era
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court had to look at a
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
number of cases involving groups that at
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
the time uh were were considered
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
important so for example the at least by
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
some people so for example the students
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
for Democratic Society um at the
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
national level were advocating for the
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
violent overthrow of the government of
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
the United States and in a case called
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
he V James uh this was a case out of
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh a university there had
 
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
said we obviously can't have a group
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's advocating for the violent
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
overthrow of the government of the
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
United States be a recognized student
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
group on campus that case went up to the
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court and the US Supreme
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
Court said you can't engage in Viewpoint
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon the view they
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
hold no matter how much we may disagree
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
no matter how AB warant we may find it
 
01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:19.719 align:start position:0%
to be if they engage in conduct that
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
facilitates the over throw of the United
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
States if they engage in violence if
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
they engage in harassment if they engage
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
in inappropriate conduct then you
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely are in a position to act but
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
to say they can't form to discuss their
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
ideas on a University campus simply
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
because we disagree with those ideas is
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
is contrary to the protections of the
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
First Amendment my point is not to
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
defend any abhorent group my point is
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
merely to say that if that kind of
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
situation were to arise the place that a
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
a radical group with abhorent views
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
would go to try to get protection would
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
not be this state statute they would go
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
to he Le V James a long line of
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
wellestablished US Supreme Court
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
precedent on Viewpoint discrimination
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
and where I think this particular piece
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation will actually be be
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
useful the kind of litigation that's
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
actually emerged around this issue of
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
having leadership standards is not the
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
radical group it really is
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
um relatively run-of-the-mill
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
belief-based student organizations that
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
have had to sue in state after state to
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
vindicate their right to have their
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
leaders share their viewpoints so that's
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a lengthy answer I
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but yeah although it
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it really didn't it really
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
didn't address the question the the
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
question is does do these groups should
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
these groups well would these groups
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
under this policy under this proposed
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
Bill uh be entitled to the same benefits
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
and privileges available to any other
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
group um any other student organization
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
so talking about benefits and privileges
 
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
such as here's
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to run your organization and
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
here's a room in the Student Union where
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
where where where you can meet that's
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
different than a group of students that
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
may form a group rent a house somewhere
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
off campus and live together and hang
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
out together uh but we're talking about
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
where the where the university
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
financially and through through other
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
benefits forun would would be supporting
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
a group and and I don't want to I I'm
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
I'm working on the four corners of the
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
bill not not the not the you know sweet
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
Center in the middle talking about and
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have some really good
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
guidance from the US Supreme Court on
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
this issue as well so in Rosenberger
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
versus University Virginia in 1995 the
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court was clear that Student
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
Activity fee funds which is what we're
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
talking about here cannot be withheld
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
from a group merely because they promote
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
or manifest a particular belief system
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
even if it's a belief system that we
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
would find abhorent and again like so
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
much of this bill the intent of the bill
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
is to provide clear statutory language
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
that student groups can look at that
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
administrators can look at that
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
basically recapitulate what courts said
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
for a very long time so again um yes
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill says that universities in
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
determining who can be recognized who
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
can have access to benefits that every
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
other student group gets won't engage in
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint discrimination but that really
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
is just black letter first amendment
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional law um there's many
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
instances where States I think for good
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
and proper reasons pass legislation the
 
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
intent of which is to essentially
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
Implement provide guidance regarding
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
provide clear ity around um
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections and that's
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
largely what this bill does it's
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent controversy prevent
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
litigation by providing clear clear
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
language on the face of the statute
 
01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:05.719 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what the US
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said about Viewpoint
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination even against abhorent
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
groups in in Healey what they've said
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
about Student Activity fee fund access
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
with respect of viewpoint discrimination
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
in Rosenberger and so um that's
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
essentially my but we're trying to
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
decrease the likelihood that students
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
are going into court to sue their own
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
universities over issues that never
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
should get to that point because the
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
precedent is
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear thank you we do have a number of
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
other cards here so uh if there no more
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and write
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:58.149 align:start position:0%

01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
welcome well thank you very much
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
chairman lad Vice chair cordelli members
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee do you like freedom and
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
liberty in this committee that might be
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
a rhetorical question but it was a real
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
question that students ask asked on a
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
public University campus just a few
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
years ago for asking that question and
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
passing out copies of the Constitution
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
without a permit those students were
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
jail the answer on our college campuses
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
to that question shouldn't be
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
know after all the Supreme Court has
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
stated the essentiality of freedom and
 
01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
the community of American universities
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
is almost self-evident even for
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
viewpoints that we don't like indeed our
 
01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:43.639 align:start position:0%
nation's future depends on leaders that
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
are trained through the wide exposure to
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
that robust exchange of ideas which
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
discovers truth out of a multitud ude of
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
tongues rather than through any kind of
 
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.750 align:start position:0%
tongues rather than through any kind of
authoritative

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
authoritative
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
selection but many colleges and
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
universities across the country fail to
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
meet this standard the speakers in that
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
case that I I mentioned should not have
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
had to be arrested or to go through
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
litigation to vindicate their
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
rights legislation like HB 1305 helps
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
present that prevent that for students
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's public colleges and
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
universities and it allows them not to
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
rely on the M of University
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
administrators and policies that may
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
change but rather to have a baseline
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
Reliance in the law by way of
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
introduction my name is Caleb Dalton I'm
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
senior counsel with Alliance defending
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom ADF Center for academic freedom
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
has been protecting College uh and
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
University students and faculty Free
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
Speech since 2006 we've had over 435
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
victories for First Amendment matters in
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
public schools and over 15 victories at
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court since 2011 on behalf
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
of our clients I appreciate the
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you today and
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
would like to address two brief points
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
what does HB 1305 do and why does it
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
matter HB 1305 will protect the
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of students and
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately if the university is abide by
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
the Bill's requirements as you heard
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
from the prior testimony it may actually
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
save the state unnecessary attorneys
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
fees and litigations by establishing
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
this Baseline constitutional protections
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't micromanage New Hampshire
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
universities but it does set these
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
baselines that every institution should
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
meet to protect free speech and free
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
association and it makes those permanent
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
not subject to the whims of changes in
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
new staff or administrations at each
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
different institution this bill simply
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits prior restraints on student
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
speech while also permitting reasonable
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
content neutral restrictions and it
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
ensures student organizations can form
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
around shared values it allows campus
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
members to speak freely and
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
spontaneously without red tape and
 
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional restrictions and it
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
allows them to choose who they join to
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
with to speak legislators in at least 20
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
other states have passed similar bills
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
the granite state with its classic motto
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die should join States
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
across the country in protecting its
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
public universities as the marketplace
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
of ideas where Freedom not fear of
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
government restriction leads to
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation and intellectual flourishing
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
why is it needed in a state like New
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's received a high rating
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
from fire at least two reasons First
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
Freedom is never guaranteed is not
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
passed down in our bloodstream absent
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
laws or litigation it's actually subject
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the whims of Campus administrations
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
which come and go second New Hampshire
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
despite its higher rating from fire is
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
not IM immune from the impositions on
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
free speech and Association that come
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
from fears uh from students and
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
administrators you heard last spring
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
from students uh represented by first
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
Liberty who experienced firsthand the
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
student bar association's discrimination
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
against them and the recognition status
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
that was withheld from them at Alliance
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
defending freedom I represented students
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
this last year as well whose
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
organization were charged extra fees to
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
host an event on campus Because of fears
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
that others might behave poorly that's a
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
prohibited heckler's veto and is
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
literally expensive speech not free
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
speech in conclusion the status quo at
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
many universities substantially
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
restricts free speech and Association
 
01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
and it teaches that student teaches
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
students that government censorship is
 
01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
the norm not the exception New Hampshire
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
should lead in repudiating this
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
mentality and show that it's not afraid
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
of Freedom it should take a step to
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
secure the future of Freedom through a
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
well-educated citizenry that appreciates
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
the value that Free Speech brings to
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
society through firsthand experience of
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
that freedom on their campuses commend
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for its attention to this
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
vital matter and before I take questions
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to just address one quick
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh matter that was raised by
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh lenu I'm
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
apology uh on uh page 2 32 through 35 uh
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
if there is any concern that that
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
section didn't apply to the next section
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think it would be very easy to fix
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
that by striking section and inserting
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
chapter nothing in this chapter should
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
be interpreted and that way it would be
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
ured that that provision applies to all
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
the sections within the chapter thank
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
you and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
is

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
noncommercial um expressive activity uh
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
for example is is a campaign considered
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
commercial of political
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
campaign I don't believe so so that's
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
considered a non-commercial what would
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
be considered a commercial activity So
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
within First Amendment law there's a
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
definition of commercial expression is
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
that which either engages in an exchange
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
or proposes to engage in exchange of
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
money for Value so it's basically
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
commercial speech so you're selling
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
something or asking you know trying to
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
sell something on campus that has that
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
that has an exchange of money is that
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
value some some some courts have inter
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
red that to be Beyond you know so his
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
services so for example fundraising some
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
courts have said
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
fundraising um even for a nonprofit for
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
example that's not considered commercial
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
but they've said that is commercial
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
speech so I think that and some courts
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
would fall under that and my my second
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
question is um the last particular uh
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
section on on page three um 27 through
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
30 the
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
severability um whenever I see that I
 
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
always uh think that there must be
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
something in this bill that uh could
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
possibly be unconstitutional I was
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could point out uh any
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
section in this that that uh is
 
01:52:01.719 --> 01:52:04.030 align:start position:0%
section in this that that uh is
particularly

01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
um in line for litigation or uh that
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
could be um declared
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um that hasn't been
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
already I don't think there is any
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill that could be
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
declared unconstitutional it it walks
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
the it basically reiterates the lines
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
that courts have laid down over the
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
Decades of what does the Constitution
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
allow uh univers so it sets that
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
Baseline of what courts have already
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
said is the law and that's one of the
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
reasons there's benefit to passing it is
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
it sets that Baseline so it protects the
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
state from litigation in the future by
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
saying hey we're going to follow this
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
Baseline and that way you don't have to
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
fear litigation in the future because
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
you've already set that Baseline
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
established by the Constitution you have
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
a followup to that
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
be a third third question so if this is
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
it yes go ahead okay three strikes and
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm out okay um so uh why put in the
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
severability law is that that that some
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
of this has not been challenged in court
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
before I so severability my
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is to generally included
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
in most legislation to my knowledge but
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not a drafter of legislation so um I
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
do I I frankly don't know any provision
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
on this that would be subject to a
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenge okay thank you
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
the

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
sir for taking my
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
question as a former University
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
president I've been present at a lot of
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrations in which there were
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
activities which were perhaps by local
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
or state law illegal speaking
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
specifically smoke inss and does the
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
freedom of
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
expression addressed in in this
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
law continue to the fact to the point
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
where it enables people to legally
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
conduct a smoke in a
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana against the laws of whatever
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
may exist is that legal I don't think so
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's conduct not expression now it
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
may be there are a few cases where you
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
know somebody's argued om my conduct is
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
to express a message right and maybe
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's an argument someone could try to
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
make but I don't think under this
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
statute it's because of somebody's
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint not because of their conduct
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
so if the a Prohibition on on smoking
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
for example is a content and Viewpoint
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
neutral prohibition and this law
 
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
specifically allows for that type of
 
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
Regulation as long as it's content
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint neutral it's not targeting
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
smoking for example it's or a Viewpoint
 
01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
of marijuana legalization right it's
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
just the conduct of smoking that could
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely be prohibited under this my
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this bill for sure
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
awful lot of college dorms are illegal
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
moment okay we'll uh move on here um are
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
there any other questions thank you very
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
Gonzalez welcome again yeah thank you
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%

individual rights and expression also
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
known as fire I'm here in support of HP
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
1305 this bill guarantees crucial First
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment protections at New Hampshire's
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Education First
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
the bill would designate designate
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
outdoor areas of Campus as public forums
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
this would effectively ban so-called
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
Free Speech Zone
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
which are often small remote areas that
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
imperially quarantine expressive
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
activity to isolated areas of Campus
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
over 20 states have already enacted laws
 
01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
to ban these so-called Free Speech zones
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
further this bill helpfully sorry excuse
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
me and um further this bill helpfully
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
and carefully defines the line between
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
constitu protected protests and un and
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
unprotected heckers
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
vetos New Hampshire Public institutions
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
of higher education have maintained
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
policies in the past past that severely
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
limited students speech rights for
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
instance the University of New Hampshire
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
had a policy in the past that required
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
student organizations to get their
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
flyers and pamphlets they sought to
 
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
distribute pre-approved by the campus
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
police chief that blatantly
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional policy was on the books
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
for some time thankfully after working
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
with fire to revise those
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional policies the University
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire now receives Fire's
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
highest green light speech code rating
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
meaning it has no speech codes that
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
seriously Peril Free Speech rights I'm
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
also happy to note that UNH ranked third
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
out of uh 248 colleges and fires 2023
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
college free speech rankings now is the
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
time to statutorily lock in these speech
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
protective policies last year much of
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
the discussion centered on whether this
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill was needed if un is doing so well
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
why is a law needed I think in the last
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
few months has shown that commitments to
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
free speech at by University
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
administrators unfortunately can have in
 
01:57:22.109 --> 01:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
flow many administrators have had
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
difficulties making clear to their
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
campus communities what is acceptable
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
and what is not often times facing
 
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
outside pressure to crack down on
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
unpopular speech at their institutions
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
at public universities including at UNH
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
commitments to free speech should not
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
change at the whim of whichever
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
administrator is currently in charge
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
instead is imperative that legisl that
 
01:57:47.709 --> 01:57:47.719 align:start position:0%
this legislature lock in free speech
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
protections into law the bill also aims
 
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
to remedy the threat to freedom of
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
Association created by the Supreme Court
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
in clsv Martinez and sharply divided 54
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
decision the Court held despite its own
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
long-standing precedent of holding
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association that public
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
university may require its student
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
organizations to accept any student as a
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
voting member or leader regardless of
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether that student openly disagrees
 
01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
with or is even hostile to the group's
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
fundamental fundamental
 
01:58:19.709 --> 01:58:19.719 align:start position:0%
beliefs College democrats should be able
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
to require that members be Democrats and
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
the Muslim Student Association should be
 
01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
able to exclude from its leadership
 
01:58:28.589 --> 01:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
those who oppose Islamic teachings
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
Fire's view is that the Campus Community
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
is made more vibrant when belief based
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
organizations are able to organize and
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
unite behind their shared
 
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
beliefs um lastly I'd like to um uh note
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
something that was said earlier with
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
regard to uh the
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
um what regard to the TR threats and
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
then the incitement standard so that St
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
the standard that's mentioned in the
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill is the uh Supreme Court's standard
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
for incitement in brand um in the
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
brandonburg case so that's why that
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
language didn't there it could just say
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
incitement but it just says the test
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
right there so that's why it didn't
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
there um but yeah in conclusion uh fire
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
um supports this legislation and I
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%

01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
used to bother the heck out of me but uh
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%

have these um U neutral these time
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
placeat and man restrictions so as long
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
as they're you know content Viewpoint
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
neutral um those types of laws would be
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional so as long as um all
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
types of um uh kind of expression was
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
like prohibited at like those times then
 
02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:36.679 align:start position:0%
yeah of course that would be that that
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
would be those would be constitutional
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know you would get into the problems

hours you can only have viewpoints we
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
agree with something like that that
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
would not be Viewpoint neutral right so
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
as long as uh those time place manager
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions um uh you know our
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%

extends to receiving the the same
 
02:01:37.069 --> 02:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
benefits and priv privileges meaning
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%

these on these subjects even more so
 
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
well definitely more so than myself uh
 
02:02:08.069 --> 02:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the relevant case is
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
the Rosenberger case and yes you know if
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%

02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
to um groups that you know you can't
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on discrimination so
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
you can't say you know the obviously the
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
easy one you can't say college Democrats
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
get you know all the space in the world
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%

know in a corner somewhere type thing um
 
02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%

uh my name is Jacob Coughlin I'm from
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
Derry and I'm here to speak in favor of
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill um I'm not a politician I'm not
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
a lawyer I'm a freshman in college so
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
let's get that out there first um but
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
I've tried to organize different groups
 
02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:37.639 align:start position:0%
in my community and at school and at the
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
at UNH Durham I ran into uh many issues
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
with campus
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
Administration where they would do
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
everything in their power to prevent me
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
from organizing there whether whether it
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
be calling them for days on end or um
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
sending emails in an extensive
 
02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
administrative process they did
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
everything in their power to prevent me
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
from you know organizing like-minded
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
students which in my opinion is an issue
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
for anyone in New Hampshire you know
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a republican issue or a
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
Democrat issue
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
um so I mean that's all I'd really like
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
to address you know it was very
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to um to organize they did
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
everything that they could to stop me
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
whether that be requiring permit on
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
public land and uh things like that
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um I have a question
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
for you what were you trying to organize
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to organize volunteers
 
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
for um a quick uh for a few events
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's all uh nothing really crazy can
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
you explain the events the purpose uh
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just free speech events with
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
organizations so uh for example we
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to organize people for the
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity um for other
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
groups like that as well just general
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
Free Speech
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
stuff further
 
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:00.679 align:start position:0%
questions yes well represent leus then
 
02:05:00.679 --> 02:05:01.589 align:start position:0%
questions yes well represent leus then
represent

02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you for taking my question um
 
02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
were you eventually able to have those
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
events or not uh yes I was but we had to
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
go through a very extensive process uh
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it seemed almost like they
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
were doing everything in their power to
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
legally prevent us from being there um
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
again that's my opinion but um yeah okay
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
than scary but I must have been reading
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
perinel thank you Mr chairman um and
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and um
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
exercising your freedom of speech to
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
come before our committee today do you
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
know of any other organizations on the
 
02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:55.719 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire campus that
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
have had trouble organizing I seem to
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
recall an incident I believe from maybe
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
about a year ago um I'm not familiar
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
with any to my knowledge um but all I do
 
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
know is my own personal experience where
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
it took a lot more effort than frankly
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
it should in America to organize you
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
know a group of people to act in a
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
political fashion
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh I do have another follow-up
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
question then do you know uh if there
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
are other organizations had to go
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
through the same process as you had to
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
go through or were you being
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
discriminated against oh I'm not
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with that but in my opinion I
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
feel like I was being discriminated
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
against uh based on our viewpoints we
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
had um campus Administration be very
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
confronted or uh very aggressive with us
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent us from organizing
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
um threatening to remove us from campus
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
before we had a permit even though we
 
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
were on public land uh doing a First
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment protected activity So yeah
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank you gu represent Damon thank you
 
02:07:04.109 --> 02:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
here could you tell us in more detail
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
what was the timeline between when the
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
process began for you to um have your
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
events happen and what were the
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
expectations of what you needed to do to
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:07:24.189 --> 02:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
approved uh so I had to call multiple
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
times uh campus security campus
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
Administration calls emails things like
 
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
that um frankly I don't remember exactly
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
how long the process was uh ballpark
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
five six days maybe a week um and it
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't a holiday week or anything like
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't Thanksgiving that we were
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
trying this
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't know it was lengthly uh
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
there was definitely a lot a lot of
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
Hoops to jump through that felt frankly
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for again a First Amendment
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.159 --> 02:07:57.709 align:start position:0%
 
campus

02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
campus
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
yes what was the size of the event in
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the expected number of
 
02:08:05.069 --> 02:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
individuals so it was just setting up a
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
table with two people and asking people
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
to volunteer for us um or to come to our
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
events so it wasn't like we were
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
creating a a scene we were next to a
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
walkway just talking to people so it
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily a uh like a large
 
02:08:18.639 --> 02:08:20.750 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily a uh like a large
deal

02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
deal
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
right represent
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
for being here and for your testimony um
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
I think candidly we can say that there
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
are considerable political divides in
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
this country um and that is reflected in
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
college campuses we we've seen that so
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
my question to you is just a very
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
general sense is that your belief and
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh all groups
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of what side their on or
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
their Viewpoint are currently treated
 
02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:52.830 align:start position:0%
their Viewpoint are currently treated
the

02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
same by the uh the
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
university uh personally I don't think
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
that we're all treated the same um I
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
feel like if I was there advocating for
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
abortion or a different I guess more
 
02:09:09.390 --> 02:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
leftwing social cause I would definitely
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
be in a uh in a in a poor position or
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
sorry a better position than where I was
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
then uh I mean honestly arguing for a
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
more conservative standpoint or
 
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint at University where it's so
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly and obviously liberal
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
it's really a tough position to be in I
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
mean and of course the university can't
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
outright reject me because of my opinion
 
02:09:32.549 --> 02:09:32.559 align:start position:0%
but they definitely did everything in my
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
opinion in their power to prevent me
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
from speaking my mind and organizing and
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
doing other first amendment protected
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.069 --> 02:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
you represent Luna thank you Mr chair um
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
when you you you mentioned um that um
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
that you received some um I I guess uh
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh had some interaction with uh with
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
University Personnel during events um
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
were were you in violation of um of any
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
particular uh freedom of speech um
 
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
policies uh to my knowledge or at least
 
02:10:16.549 --> 02:10:16.559 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge at the time no um they
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
what about your knowledge now apparently
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
we required a permit I'm not sure if we
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
actually did to be totally honest
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
because it was two people setting up a
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
table and in my opinion that falls under
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment um but they you know
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
they confronted us hey you need to get a
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
permit to set this table up they tried
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
to make us move locations they were as
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
difficult about the process as
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
possible so followup Mr chair yes so um
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that uh UNH is
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know ranked three out of 200 48 uh
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
Institutes of higher education with
 
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
respect to its freedom of speech policy
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
so it likely has uh a policy that um
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
that U that consistent with this uh uh
 
02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:04.599 align:start position:0%
bill um uh May um maintain an enforce
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable time place and manner
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions um and uh were those the
 
02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions that were being imposed
 
02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
upon you now that you are more familiar
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
with the policies I'm not necessarily
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
sure but I also don't see how 11 a.m.
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
next to a path a foot path on the campus
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
of a public university is really in
 
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
violation of any reasonable expectation
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
of making a public
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
disturbance we weren't making a scene we
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
weren't doing anything really
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
confrontational or terrible in that
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
regard we were there with a table asking
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
for people to volunteer for us okay
 
02:11:42.599 --> 02:11:45.229 align:start position:0%

now um so if the chief wants to come
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%

welcome

02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh hello everyone and thank you for the
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify for the record my
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
pintel with me here today is uh Chief
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
Paul Dean who is the chief of police uh
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
UNH um we have written testimony that
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
we'll will circulate um here when we're
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
finished candidly it's essentially
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing that we did last
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
year so rather than read it back to you
 
02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
again uh I I've proposed to go a little
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
more narrowly and to address some of the
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
things that I've heard uh from the other
 
02:12:57.149 --> 02:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
speakers so far um the first is that
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to use language
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
that courts are familiar with
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
to um reinforce existing limitations on
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
what public universities can and can't
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
do around regulation of speech and um
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
university system has some concerns
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
about whether or not uh that's correct
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
so for for example um on
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
page uh
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
two at line uh
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
25 uh right before that it's it that
 
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
that there's the language that some
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
other folks have reference saying that
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable time place and manner
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions are allowed but next
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
sentence at 25 says that any such
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions shall allow members of the
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
Campus Community which as defined in the
 
02:13:46.549 --> 02:13:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill includes not just uh students
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff but also their invited
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
guests which I'm not sure how Chief is
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to determine who's an invited
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
guest and who isn't but it's a very
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
broad definition um that those folks
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
will have the right to spontaneously and
 
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
will have the right to spontaneously and
contemporaneously

02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
assemble one of the most basic time
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
place and manner uh restrictions that
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
are employed by public institutions are
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
permit processes um as I read this
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's taking our ability
 
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
to require a permit out and so I
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
struggle how to reconcile that with the
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
idea that it preserves all reasonable
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
time place and man restrictions that are
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise available to us um and chief
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
Dean uh his office U is very deeply
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
involved with the permitting process I
 
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
wanted just briefly pause and let Chief
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh explain how permitting Works uh at
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
UNH um I'll just say from a policy
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
perspective maybe the most important
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
thing is it says in the policy that the
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
presumption is that permits are to be
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
issued we start with yes we don't look
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
for reasons to say no but uh Chief can
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps say
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
more thank
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate this opportunity to
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
address you the importance of a free
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
campus permit process and I want to
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
underline free there's no cost to this
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
permit in maintaining law enforcement
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety on campus the issuance
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
of over 300 to 350 permits each year
 
02:15:13.149 --> 02:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
without complaints underscores the
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of our current system the
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
UNH Police Department believes that
 
02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
exist permit system coupled with un
 
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
policies effectively educates both
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
oncampus and off-campus individuals
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
about acceptable behavior the Dual
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
approach ensures parity in educating the
 
02:15:32.669 --> 02:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
community about what is deemed
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable behavior before an event
 
02:15:38.189 --> 02:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
occurs by doing so we contribute to the
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
deescalation efforts reducing the
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
likelihood of Confrontation that often
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
require campus police or Public Safety
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
intervention the permanent process
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
serves as an educational tool and means
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
to encourage dialogue about behaviors
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
that may disrupt campus functioning it
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
is not meant to limit Free Speech but
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
rather enhance it by fostering
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
discussions on acceptable conduct the
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
process allows off-campus individuals to
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
be forewarned about potential
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
disruptions facilitating an environment
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
where conflicts can be avoided through
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
education and discussion the UNH
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
police's Comm commed to maintaining a
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
positive relationship with the community
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
at large however the ambiguity and
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
uncertainty introduced by this proposed
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
law risk placing the police department
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
at odds with the community as enforcing
 
02:16:32.589 --> 02:16:32.599 align:start position:0%
a poly defined law can lead increased
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
tensions and potential legal
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
challenges attorney pel's concerns about
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
the law and the ambiguity leading to
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary law suits as valid and we
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
should we should I share his
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
concern in summary the UNH police
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
supports no CA permitting process that
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on education and deescalation
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
rather than limiting Free Speech the
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
current system effectively balances the
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
need for Public Safety with the
 
02:17:02.910 --> 02:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
University's commitment to fostering an
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
environment of open dialogue and
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
expression clarifying the definition of
 
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
materially and substantially disrupts in
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill is essential to ensure
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
that the law aligns with principles that
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
do not create unnecessary
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
conflict and if I would just try to boil
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that down even further I think I would
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
describe how Chief and his folks
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
administer of the permit processes
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
trying to use a pretty good dollop of
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
common sense in balancing uh giving
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
folks access to to campus letting them
 
02:17:38.349 --> 02:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights but not uh
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily exercising the Campus
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
Community not possibly running up
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
against violating campus policy or law
 
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
such that the event can go off people
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
could have their speech the university
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
continue to function um Chief also
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the other pieces of the
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
bill that I wanted to highlight um which
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
is the the notion of a material and
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
substantial disruption um that is a
 
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
phrase that you see in court cases um
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's used to describe a public
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
educational entities ability to take
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
action against uh a speech and conduct
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
event that has gotten out of control
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're not required under the First
 
02:18:16.110 --> 02:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment to allow uh actions that
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
disrupt our operation
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that phrase is a phrase that comes
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
out of well understood court cases
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
however um that's not how it's used in
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
this bill um the phrase materially and
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
substantially disrupt is defined in this
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh at page one starting at line
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
13 in a much narrower way than courts
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
usually use it um it talks almost
 
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
entirely about what is called usually
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
called The heckler's veto which is when
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else comes on to campus and
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
does something that prevents uh somebody
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the community from exercising their
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
right to free speech um the right to in
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
general the right of an educational
 
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
institution to prevent disruption isn't
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
just limited to occasions when a Heckler
 
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
comes on and tries to disrupt an event
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
you know what if what's being disrupted
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
is not somebody else's speech but it's a
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
nursing class what if what's being
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
disrupted is a counseling session under
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment we do retain some
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
discretion to act in those situations
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
again Chief and his folks use a good
 
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
dollop of sense in that and making sure
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
that rather than shutting things down we
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that people have you
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
know are able to express themselves in
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
other ways and other places of necessary
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
um so again I I we struggle the system
 
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
struggles to reconcile the idea that
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
this bill just clarifies and restates
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
existing law with the notion that it
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
with uh the fact that it appears to
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
restrict us from using some reasonable
 
02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
time place and manner restrictions and
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
it uses some language in unfamiliar ways
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
and whenever you've got familiarity or
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
ambiguity how it all ultimately gets
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
decided is in litigation and litigation
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
is has a huge cost in terms of money and
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
time for the system um I should also
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
just finish by saying um we've expressed
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative papor is has been
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
wonderfully available to us um and we've
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
expressed sort of these concerns and
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
additional ones we have a we we
 
02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
circulated to him a a proposed markup
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we thought could address some of
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
these challenges um I don't want to go
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
through the entire thing here because I
 
02:20:20.349 --> 02:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful of folks time and
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
also their bladders um so I'll pause
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
there uh I'm happy to answer any
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions that folks have and a chief
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
May chime in as well in his areas of
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
expertise thank you very much and this
 
02:20:34.349 --> 02:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
first one's for both of you um invited
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
guests vers uninvited guests hecklers
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
could be in both of those groups um how
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
do you how do you deal with the The
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
Uninvited types that are seen at one
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
protest after another throughout this
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
country that all of a sudden arrive on
 
02:20:52.359 --> 02:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
country that all of a sudden arrive on
your

02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
campus is the permanent Pro process set
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
up to uh deal with this type of
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
activity so uh the permit would be
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
required of the organizer um presumably
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
a Heckler is coming in um to disrupt
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they ought to be separately
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
requesting a permit I I take your point
 
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
that many times they wouldn't um as for
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
how it's managed uh You Know Chief and
 
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.389 align:start position:0%
how it's managed uh You Know Chief and
his

02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
team managed that issue with respect of
 
02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
very large events all of the time um
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
obviously just recently uh uh former
 
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
president Trump came uh and rented out
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
the Whitmore Center had an event um an
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
event that obviously had a chance for
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
disruption Chief and his team Managed IT
 
02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
there was no disruption um I think they
 
02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
again have pretty good Common Sense
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
processes in place to address that um to
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
your point though uh representative lad
 
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
of how do you determine who's invited
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
and uninvited for purposes of
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
determining who has additional
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
protections under this bill I think
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
would be very challenging thank you
 
02:21:56.349 --> 02:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
Bel then represent cordelli thank you Mr
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here um
 
02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
you brought up uh an interesting point
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
about the time place and Mana
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions excuse me as involves the
 
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
the permitting process that you
 
02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.870 align:start position:0%
the permitting process that you
currently

02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:22:12.270 --> 02:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
have uh I'm sure most of us are aware
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
there has recently been a number of
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
rallies protests vigils other such
 
02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
things group Gatherings um on the UNH
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
campus some of which have made news
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
headlines um I'm not here to take any
 
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
position on the individual speech they
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
have that right but my question to you
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
is were all of those events permanent
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
events um by the
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
university I I don't have details on
 
02:22:38.429 --> 02:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
that Chief do
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm not sure about about all the
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
events you're talking about but I think
 
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
the ones that you are talking about do
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
have a permit and and the permits are
 
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
free there's no there's never been a no
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
I've been a policeman for 39 years 34 of
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
them at the University there's never
 
02:22:59.550 --> 02:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
been a no to it it's always meant to
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
educate to make sure on issues such as
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
how do you get electricity if you need
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
to use a a megaphone how do you if you
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
want to put something in the ground you
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
have to use Dig Safe that's a law we
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
talk about littering you know making
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
sure that they know they need to pick up
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
their things so that's that's the
 
02:23:19.469 --> 02:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
educational aspect uh of those the other
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
part to that is is I have a limited
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
police force and so I need to know how
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
many people are going to be on our
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
campus so I can provide Public Safety
 
02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
Services or bring in more people for
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
that so the permit posit informs but
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to those those I think
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about they were permitted
 
02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure of all of them that
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about but if they came to
 
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
us they would have been
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
permitted and if I made a quick follow
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
up on that thank you that that does help
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
um so obviously it's great that that the
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
permits are issued freely and the the uh
 
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
they're not turned down but we also have
 
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the possibility which has we
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard elsewhere that there is some
 
02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps unequal enforcement happening of
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
non-permanent events so in order to um
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
assess that and do our due diligence as
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
a committee would it be possible to say
 
02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
um receive a copy of permit records that
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
have recently occurred so we can compare
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
that to Media reports sure absolutely
 
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from representative
 
02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you thank you
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
gentleman for being here um uh I believe
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned um about the definition
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
for material materially and
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
substantially disrupts being unfamiliar
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
based on other Court decisions and so
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
forth could you specify what in
 
02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
particular in this definition um causes
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh you a
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
problem it's the narrowness of it uh
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's the fact that that the only
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
activity that seems to be defined as
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
materially and substantially disruptive
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
is Mater is Con is our actions that
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
disrupt someone else's speech there's
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
nothing that goes to disrupting the
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
actual business of the University uh and
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
there are cases dating back to to to
 
02:25:06.429 --> 02:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
Tinker in 1968 that stamped the
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
proposition that educational
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
institutions can take action to prevent
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
property uh last year we had I think the
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
same bill coming before us I don't know
 
02:25:21.790 --> 02:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
where the if there are specific changes
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some dealing with the costs but
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
um did you have an opportunity during
 
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
that the year that we've had here to try
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
to address those concerns you've had and
 
02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
is there any way to amend this to
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
incorporate the concerns that I see a
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
hand up down and back from the
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative okay I think I'll get my
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
answer but go ahead the answer again he
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
he's been very available we did meet
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
with him we did send around some
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
proposed changes obviously the bill is
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
his to to submit to cc's fit okay great
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
further questions because the next one
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
which you're going to invite up is going
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be the prime sponsor of the bill um
 
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
Valerie you have a question um it is not
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
a question but James TBO has arrived
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%

02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:13.000 align:start position:0%

02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
the University
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%

02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
TBO good morning Mr chair members of the
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is James TBO I'm
 
02:26:43.389 --> 02:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
the chair of the New Hampshire
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Council which
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
is a statutory Comm Committee of the
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
legislature under rsa1 19k I'm here on
 
02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the council to express my
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
support for HB
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
1305 um I think we all agree that it's
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
very important that we um ensure
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
students Free Speech rights on college
 
02:27:06.269 --> 02:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
campuses but I'm
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
not I'm not so much here to talk about
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
the merits of the bill because I feel
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
like many of the other speakers have
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
already done that um I'm here to kind of
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
talk about what the bill is lacking and
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
that is representation and protections
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
for high school students so um I'm
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on this as a high school senior
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
myself um who has dealt with um freedom
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
of speech suppression at my school um
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
during the summer of my sophomore year
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
going into my junior year I wanted to
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
establish a chapter of Young Americans
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
for freedom on my high school campus and
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
I um my high school principal said that
 
02:27:43.389 --> 02:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
he did not want to approve the
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
organization because he feared that it
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
would make people uncomfortable able and
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
I got him on tape saying that and we
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
threatened a lawsuit against the school
 
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
um under Free Speech grounds and we
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
ended up um getting the club established
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um however with the current Foundation
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
of federal law that exists under I
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe us code
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
4072 um there um it's called the equal
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
access act and it basically says the
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
school is allowed to impose restrictions
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
on student organizations as long as
 
02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
those restrictions are evenly applied so
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
they told us that we could only have um
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
one poster on school grounds we could
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
only we could not advertise via email
 
02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
via School announcements or any of these
 
02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
things that typically clubs are allowed
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
to do on campus um and they said they
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
could do this because they were also
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to start applying those
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions to every other club on
 
02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
campus as well and they also um they
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
also strung out the approval process for
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
my club by 6 to 9 months
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
um so because there are none of these
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
Protections in place for the actual
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
establishment of these organizations um
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
it essentially suppresses speech and
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
it's I think blatantly unconstitutional
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I um but they're allowed to do it
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
because of the particular way that the
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
law is written so we would like to
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to either amend
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
this bill or bring forward a new bill to
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
also address the concern of um High
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
School Free Speech suppression as well
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd have we take any further
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions on that regard thank you very
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any hands thank you
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
very much for coming today yeah uh like
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and members of
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm sorry for my anxiety I
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
am running late for work uh and actually
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
I am supposed to introduce the following
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill and I have uh managed to get
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative Hill to do that for me um
 
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh on behalf of Cam Kenny um so I'm just
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
going to speak conceptually I'm not
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
going to have time to take questions but
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
I was here testifying for a
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
substantively similar Bill last year and
 
02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
I believe I opened my testimony last
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
year with a statement to the effect of
 
02:30:03.870 --> 02:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
now why would a farle socialist
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
self-avowed atheist be speaking in favor
 
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
of a bill that's primarily supported by
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
conservatives and religious people and
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
what I said then is what I still believe
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
which is Free Speech is inherently a
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
liberal notion John Lock liberal
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
principles is a founding of our country
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
notion and it is historically a
 
02:30:29.230 --> 02:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
progressive cause and if you need um
 
02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
evidence look no further than the
 
02:30:34.349 --> 02:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
protests against the Vietnam War on
 
02:30:37.710 --> 02:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
campuses where at least four students
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
lost their lives um look no further than
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
the civil rights movement and the
 
02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
protest there and what I said then is
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
that that somebody has to be the adult
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the room because the winds change
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
what is popular opinion today may be
 
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
unpopular opinion tomorrow and while
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
today it may be the popular opinion to
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
have liberal Notions and conservative
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
opinion may be unpopular I am unwilling
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
even though that benefits my talking
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
points I'm unwilling to risk freedom of
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
speech because tomorrow it may be the
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
other way around and I what I could not
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
have predicted last year when I
 
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
testified to that effect was how quick
 
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
the winds have changed because today one
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the most as you all know um
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
controversial topics on campus is the
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
situation in Gaza and what is the
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
definition of a Justified Act of
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
retaliation versus oppression what is
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
colonialism what is genocide these
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions are coming up and now it is
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
the unpopular leftist opinion that is
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
being threatened in many scenarios
 
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps not all the way across the board
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
but certainly that is of um something
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's weighing heavy on us
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
today so I continue to believe as I did
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
then that the way we overcome bad ideas
 
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
is to not oppress those bad ideas to not
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
suppress them because that gives a
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
talking point to the people with those
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
bad ideas that they weren't allowed to
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
say what they had to say and they were
 
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
unjustly being restrained now I probably
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't agree on a whole lot uh with the
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
people who are advocating for this bill
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that I need my free
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
speech protected even though I'm not
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
planning on going back to college uh I
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
need my free speech protected and so
 
02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
therefore I believe in protecting theirs
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'll wrap that up I can
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
only speak conceptually I understand
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has had some minor
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
changes I whatever you see fit but I
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
just want to Advocate as the token
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
leftist in the room um for the concept
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
of of the bill and I apologize it's not
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
like me to not be able to take questions
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
but I really need to go to work and um
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
again thank you for representative Hill
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
introducing the next thank you and good
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
luck getting the
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
work um lastly we will have the prime
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
Muller thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee I really appreciate
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
your time and and uh I'll do my best to
 
02:33:20.910 --> 02:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
be reasonably brief under the
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances which may not be quite
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
brief we already spoke about this bill
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
last year and a lot of those things
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
apply so I'm not going to repeat
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
everything I just want to remind you
 
02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
that I was born and raised in a
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
communist country and experienced the
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
lack of Freedom which leads to me
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
appreciating Freedom a bit more than
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
people who never experien the opposite I
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
also want to remind you that I've been
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
involved in education in one way or the
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
other my entire life my mom was an
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
elementary school teacher I taught for
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
living for a decade I served on the
 
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
school board I'm serving on finance too
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with the State education budget
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
I am one of the people who truly
 
02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
understands education you know and uh
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
again the value of freedom of speech and
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
Association this is a nonpartisan Bill
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
its only intent is to assure that
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
everybody gets equal protection under
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
the law I don't care which side people
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
are on I don't care whether I agree or
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't agree with them I think all speech
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
deserves to be protected because when we
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
start picking and choosing which speech
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
deserves protection we are opening the
 
02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
door to our speech being on the nauy
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
list somewhere down the road so we need
 
02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
to protect speech for all groups whether
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
we agree with them or
 
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
not I am a consensus Builder I believe
 
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
in working you know to try to get a
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
general agreement I have a approach this
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
in a very Cooperative way I started
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
engaging with the college systems since
 
02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
late 2022 and we've been in contact ever
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
since we made a lot of progress we all
 
02:34:57.630 --> 02:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
agreed with the goals of this bill we
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
are still arguing about various language
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
items but nobody in this room as far as
 
02:35:05.230 --> 02:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
I could tell disagrees with the premise
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill we were almost there last
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
spring when uh I was told that if I just
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
make one or two minor changes the bill
 
02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
would be ready to be approved by the
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
universities and get brought by partisan
 
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
support unfortunately when we sat down
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
last summer the Red Line I received from
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
UNH which I believe there are copies of
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
it in the room if you want them required
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
extensive changes that were much more
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
extensive than I expected and therefore
 
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
we couldn't really agree on the language
 
02:35:36.750 --> 02:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
as a result I decided to fill this bill
 
02:35:39.389 --> 02:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
using the 2023 language it's pretty much
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as HB 516 with two
 
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
minor changes one the committee noticed
 
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
that we were inconsistent in using
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
student organization we used two
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
different terms for it the bill has been
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
cleaned so that only the word student
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
organizations are used and I added a
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
change limiting the amount of Damages
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
that can be awarded in as to 20,000 to
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
protect the university system from
 
02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk other than that it's
 
02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
really the same bill as I uh you know
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
reminded the university system
 
02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives this morning I do remain
 
02:36:14.349 --> 02:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
open to amending the bill especially
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
since this is a two Comm bill it has an
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
FN in the most optimistic scenario where
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
we pass it we still has to go through
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
the house floor twice it has to go
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
through here it has to go through
 
02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
Finance I will continue to engage to see
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
if I can make the bill better even if it
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to the point where they are
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable you
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
know supporting it at least I want to
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
make it more palatable to them so I will
 
02:36:43.389 --> 02:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
continue to work with that until you
 
02:36:45.870 --> 02:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
know the end of the session and Frank
 
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
frankly if it doesn't pass I'll continue
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
to work on it until he
 
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
passes now a couple of things that the
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to deal with first the
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill prohibits Free Speech zones Free
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
Speech zones are um essentially a word
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
that is used to describe the ban on Free
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
Speech in most areas of the campus that
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of universities are using my
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
daughter graduated from RPI and got to
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
experience fand the firstand the
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
chilling effect of free speech
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
chilling effect of free speech
zones

02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
zones
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is also designed to decrease
 
02:37:22.269 --> 02:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of times when students are
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
denied their rights and then they have
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
to go through a lengthy appeal process
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
and retain legal council to finally get
 
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
a resolution I want to give credit to
 
02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
the university system for being quick to
 
02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues once they escalate
 
02:37:38.349 --> 02:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
through that process but frankly if this
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill was passed there would be way fewer
 
02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
times when this will be needed I don't
 
02:37:45.870 --> 02:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
want to be cheesy and quote Martin
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
Luther King for no reason but he did say
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the right delayed is a right denied
 
02:37:52.269 --> 02:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
he was using it in a very different
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
context but the principle still applies
 
02:37:56.910 --> 02:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
if we make it amazingly hard for people
 
02:37:58.349 --> 02:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
to exercise their rights we are
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
infriging on their rights because there
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
are few people who have the courage to
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
hire lawyers and go you know towards the
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
university threatening legal action most
 
02:38:13.389 --> 02:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
people will just want no trouble they'll
 
02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
just comply and move on we really
 
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
happen the bill also clarifies that no
 
02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
content based restrictions on speech are
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
allowed outside of a few narrowly
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
defined situation obviously this is
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
already um known from Court decisions
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know the Congressional research
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
service has a January 10 2023 report
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
stating that the Supreme Court
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that laws restricted or
 
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
compelling speech based on the content
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
have the potential to expel certain
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
ideas or viewpoints from public de
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
debate so the court typically regards
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
such content based laws as presumptively
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional is based on R versus
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:59.469 --> 02:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
2015 I've heard reasonably often that
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
hey if there are court cases already why
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
do we need a law going to courts is a
 
02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:05.950 align:start position:0%
do we need a law going to courts is a
tricky

02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
tricky
 
02:39:08.429 --> 02:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
thing a lot of people cannot afford to
 
02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
go to courts or are afraid to and
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
frankly you know you never know what a
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
court will do when you go to court and
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you stories in the hallway if
 
02:39:19.389 --> 02:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
you want to know why I feel that way I
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to take the time of the
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
committee with that
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
but it is better to avoid the need for
 
02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
litigation and this bill is designed to
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
avoid that also college students are
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
adults they are not you know K through
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
12 students who are minors and deserve a
 
02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
different level of protection they are
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
all legal adults or the vast majority of
 
02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
them so are the staff and the faculty
 
02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
they have the maturity and skills to
 
02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
handle hearing speech they disagree
 
02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
with claiming otherwise honestly not you
 
02:39:53.790 --> 02:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
know is a it's offensive to me because
 
02:39:56.269 --> 02:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
it implies that somehow our kids
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
graduate high school without the ability
 
02:40:00.429 --> 02:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
to you know reason and figure out who's
 
02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
right and who's wrong we've already
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
heard that this year reminded us how
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
important it is for our points of view
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be expressed whether we agree with
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
them or not so I'm not going to go over
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
that to summarize the freedom of
 
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
Association part of the bill it does
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
really one thing it states that student
 
02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
organizations must be allowed to choose
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
who can be a member and be allowed to
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
enforce their codes and con of
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
conduct the point of this language is to
 
02:40:31.870 --> 02:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
disallow all commer policies which have
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
been found to be constitutional by
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
courts which frankly kind of ruins the
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
trust I have in the courts because I
 
02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
have no idea how somebody can say that
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
your freedom of Association is respected
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
if when you want to associ associate
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
with somebody you have to associate with
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
everybody who wants to associate with
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
you if I have a chess club do I really
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to admit people who hate
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
chess obviously I'm choosing innocuous
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
examples here but how could it be that
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
we have a freedom of Association when we
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't get to choose who we associate
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
with and that's really what all Commerce
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
policies do and this is why I think they
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
need to be taken off the table I will
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
give credit to the UN system and state
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they clearly told me they don't
 
02:41:21.389 --> 02:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
have them and they don't plan on having
 
02:41:21.399 --> 02:41:22.710 align:start position:0%
have them and they don't plan on having
them

02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
anytime I just don't think they should
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
be on the table just in case that
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
position May ever change I think it's
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
our job to make it clear that's not okay
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
now to touch to quickly touch on a
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns raised earlier there
 
02:41:37.630 --> 02:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
was a question on separability Clause
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's just general language we don't
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
expect any parts of this bill to be
 
02:41:43.230 --> 02:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
stricken out but since you never know
 
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
what courts do having that type of
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
clause is just good practice in writing
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
laws because it it assures that only a
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill will be struck down
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
instead of the whole thing if such a
 
02:41:56.269 --> 02:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
clause would be missing in regards to
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
disruptions to the campus as a result on
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
Free Speech again the restrictions are
 
02:42:04.349 --> 02:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
defined in 188 DJ column 2 Roman numoral
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
2 they have to be clear published
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
content and Viewpoint neutral and
 
02:42:09.790 --> 02:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
provide ample alternative means of
 
02:42:12.190 --> 02:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
expression the existing policies do that
 
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
this just codifies the requirement that
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
any future policies do the
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
same there was a question in regards to
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
188 j24 which is the part of the bill
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
that says that nothing in this section
 
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
shall be interpreted as you know
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
preventing public in institutions of
 
02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
higher education from prohibiting
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
limiting and so on and so forth I would
 
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to amend the bill to
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that that applies to the entire
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
Bill not just to a specific section that
 
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
was the intent and I thought that where
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
it was placed that was clear if there
 
02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
is any conf Fusion over that really
 
02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
applies I'll be happy to reward it
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
slightly and move it out of that section
 
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
and put it at the end of the bill make
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
clear that it applies to the entire bill
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's just easy housekeeping and I will
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
be happy to continue to engage with un
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
over any issue but obviously one of the
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
ones that was brought up today was the
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
permitting issue I want to work with
 
02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
them toh see how we can help them
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
continue to do their
 
02:43:15.550 --> 02:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
job you know to require a permit for
 
02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
large events or in situations where a
 
02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
permit is needed while at the same time
 
02:43:22.750 --> 02:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
trying not to unnecessarily burden tiny
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
little expressive action activities from
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
requiring a permit and you know we seem
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
to have a lot in common there so U you
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
know I will continue to work on that one
 
02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
know I will continue to work on that one
quick

02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
quick
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
thing this uh hearing was scheduled on
 
02:43:42.750 --> 02:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
January 9 and the announcement was made
 
02:43:46.110 --> 02:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
on Friday and as a result of the really
 
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately short notice some of the
 
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to testify weren't
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
able to make it and that that is just
 
02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
how the calendar works I understand that
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
not everybody can get you know a lot of
 
02:43:58.429 --> 02:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
heads up but since the bill is basically
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
unchanged I would appreciate it if you
 
02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
would take the time to review last
 
02:44:03.389 --> 02:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
year's testimony since it is clearly
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
still applicable it's on the general
 
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
court YouTube channel the hearing was on
 
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
February 24th of 2023 and the relevant
 
02:44:14.269 --> 02:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
portion starts at 3 hours 59 minutes now
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
to conclude
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe that ccsnh and UNH are
 
02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
deeply committed to respecting the
 
02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
freedoms that the bill is designed to
 
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
protect the purpose of this legislation
 
02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
is to provide a clear framework that
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
would benefit everybody everybody
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
involved State residents students staff
 
02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
the institutions themselves and I do
 
02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
expect that the passage of this bill
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
will lead to financial savings due to
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
avoiding litigation and you know re
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
reduced administrative costs and I do
 
02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
hope that it will earn your support and
 
02:44:45.550 --> 02:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
obviously I'll be happy to happy to
 
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno thank you very
 
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and uh and there was
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
no doubt in my mind you were going to be
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this this back um because you
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
said so and uh and pretty much without
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
any changes um but um but going to
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
obviously I've uh spent a little bit of
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
time and actually quite a bit of time
 
02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
talking with you about the uh the
 
02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
provision for um for freedom of
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
Association and I question to you Dan do
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
you do you believe that taxpayer dollars
 
02:45:20.429 --> 02:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
or or Student Activity fees should go to
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
support student groups that promote um
 
02:45:24.990 --> 02:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
views like
 
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
genocide I do not approve of genocide I
 
02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
that's not what the question obviously I
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
but I didn't finish yet I do not approve
 
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
of those points of view but I do not
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
believe legally we have a right to
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
choose which organizations receive those
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
funds or not they have to be treated
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
equally that's why the quote from the
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on the content based
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions when we talk about Free
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
Speech the free speech that is deserves
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
the most protection is the one we
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with I can give you my
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
list of people whose speech I really
 
02:46:02.190 --> 02:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
hate hearing but those are also the same
 
02:46:04.830 --> 02:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
people for whom I will continue to fight
 
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
for their right to express those views
 
02:46:09.389 --> 02:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
because without them being allow to
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
express their views neither of us will
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
have a right to express our views once
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
we start going down that path so I don't
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
think there is any legal way to prevent
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
those benefits from being given to all
 
02:46:26.110 --> 02:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
organizations if we intend to respect
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
our Constitution and our existing Court
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
precedence including the Supreme Court
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
so a follow up on that if I may so so
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
given that response then um uh would it
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
be fair to conclude that your position
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
would be that a student group that um
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
that that um advocate Ates for genocide
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
would not be in violation of um of of
 
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
any sort of student uh ethical standards
 
02:46:56.429 --> 02:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much I would disagree
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
with their points of view when we talk
 
02:47:02.269 --> 02:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
about Free Speech the Constitution is
 
02:47:04.110 --> 02:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
clear the Supreme Court rulings are
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
clear there is no wiggle room there and
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
that is the painful part of free speech
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno that in order to
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
protect our own free speech we have to
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
Pro protect everyone else's including
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
people who we amazingly strongly
 
02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with there is no alternative I
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm I'm clear on
 
02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
that the question wasn't about Free
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
Speech the question was about associ
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
Association so a group that Associates
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
would receive um a a group of a Student
 
02:47:40.830 --> 02:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
Association that advocates for genocide
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
in your opinion based on your answers
 
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
would receive um taxpayer or student fee
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
based funding from the University system
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
um potentially um uh a room at the
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
Memorial Union building and not be in
 
02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
violation of any any U student uh um uh
 
02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:04.190 align:start position:0%
violation of any any U student uh um uh
uh

02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
ethical um standards I do believe that
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
probably they their ethics would be very
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
questionable whether they if they would
 
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
argue for such a about the
 
02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
institution's um guidelines for student
 
02:48:19.399 --> 02:48:20.910 align:start position:0%
institution's um guidelines for student
um

02:48:20.910 --> 02:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines I would like to understand if
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
we are talking about policies or
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines guidelines in my in my mind
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
policy right policies that attempt to
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
regulate the content of free speech are
 
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:35.309 align:start position:0%
regulate the content of free speech are
likely

02:48:35.309 --> 02:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
likely
 
02:48:37.469 --> 02:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
anti-constitutional based on if they are
 
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
based on content so regardless of how V
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
it is and obviously you chose a
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
particularly V topic to ask about
 
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
because you want to highlight you want
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
to highlight the you know more extreme
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
views that may
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
happen there is no wigle room in the
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution as long as those are just
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
views if those are actions obviously
 
02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
they're violating every kind of law
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
there is but if all they do is hold
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
views with disagree with then yes their
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
views should be permitted and they
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
should be treated the same way with
 
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else now mind you universities
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
being a place of higher education I
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely expect universities to use
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
the potential that such views may be
 
02:49:28.229 --> 02:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
expressed as a great opportunity to
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
teach their students on why such views
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
are so vile while at the same time they
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
have to be tolerated it would teach the
 
02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
students both the importance of constit
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know respecting the Constitution and
 
02:49:42.429 --> 02:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
also give them the tools to reject those
 
02:49:44.910 --> 02:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
horrific points of view because because
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
here's the thing I come from a communist
 
02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:48.510 align:start position:0%
here's the thing I come from a communist
country

02:49:48.510 --> 02:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
right indoctrination was tried really
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
hard and there was no uh alternative
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
schooling system or anything you had to
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
go to the same schools who taught you
 
02:50:01.469 --> 02:50:01.479 align:start position:0%
the same nonsense and I could rapiz for
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
hours over the political science and all
 
02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
those fun topics they taught at the end
 
02:50:10.990 --> 02:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
of the day people know what's wrong but
 
02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
the only way for them to confront it and
 
02:50:16.349 --> 02:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
be able to reject it is to be allowed to
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
hear it in the first place so they can
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
react to it it's like keeping kids in a
 
02:50:22.870 --> 02:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
bubble and they never develop antibodies
 
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
to develop those antibodies to develop
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to reject those horrific
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
points of view yeah you do have to
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
occasionally hear
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
them as words not as actions and be able
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
to react and explain talk back and
 
02:50:40.229 --> 02:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
explain why they are so horrific talk to
 
02:50:42.190 --> 02:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
other people who may have heard them
 
02:50:44.269 --> 02:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
those are educational opportunities if
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
we try try to hide our kids from speech
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
they may find uncomfortable we are doing
 
02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
them a great disservice and we are in my
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
opinion failing as education as an
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
educational institution because we are
 
02:50:58.110 --> 02:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
missing on all those opportunities to
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
teach them how to handle those people
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
are already out there if you hide them
 
02:51:04.229 --> 02:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
you just let them speak in the corners
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
where nobody can confront go ahead so M
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I mean I'm I'm I'm really
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
talking about Association but you keep
 
02:51:15.309 --> 02:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
going back to uh to speech and so so so
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
I I I I picked a um um you know a
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
condition that's clearly uh uh abhorent
 
02:51:29.229 --> 02:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
and uh and a in a real Edge case uh for
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
Association for
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
speech genocide would probably fall
 
02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
under true threats Express expression
 
02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
directly to provoke imminent Lawless
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
actions and likely to produce it or
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
producing harassment as defined in the
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
RSA and I'm reading from page two um
 
02:51:49.389 --> 02:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
lines 32 through
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
35 um of the bill so so I I it it
 
02:51:57.630 --> 02:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like like this bill would
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
allow for free speech of what I was
 
02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
talking about but it would allow for
 
02:52:05.229 --> 02:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
Association of groups sponsored by the
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
university uh for um uh that that that
 
02:52:14.670 --> 02:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
espoused views uh such as J as long as
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
espousing those views does not break any
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
laws the university would have to
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
accommodate all student
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
associations equally yes thank
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
you yes represent
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you representative for
 
02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill back um I was
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you recall um a month or
 
02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
two ago there was a uh Pro Palestinian
 
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
demonstration on
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
campus um and um it receiv received
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
considerable attention I think there was
 
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
even um on some national news reports
 
02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
and um it was objected to by many Jewish
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
students um specifically for chance of
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
from The River To The Sea which some
 
02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
people say is calling for genocide the
 
02:53:05.710 --> 02:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
University's position was that it was
 
02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
First Amendment freedom of speech issue
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
um first question is would you agree
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:53:13.359 --> 02:53:15.830 align:start position:0%
with that
decision

02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:53:20.269 --> 02:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
since this is a Content based question I
 
02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
actually would support the university
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
stance that people should be allowed to
 
02:53:27.950 --> 02:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
speak people should not be allowed to
 
02:53:32.349 --> 02:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
act in those ways and frankly this
 
02:53:35.190 --> 02:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
current political environment is one
 
02:53:39.389 --> 02:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
that highlights again the need for us to
 
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
be able to confront points of view that
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
we disagree through speech the remedy to
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
bad speech is good speech more of it
 
02:53:49.389 --> 02:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
than countering the points made in the
 
02:53:52.349 --> 02:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
bad speech it's a tough
 
02:53:56.590 --> 02:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
topic thank you um follow up to that um
 
02:53:59.790 --> 02:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
there was uh the most recent discussion
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
right now has been about section uh 188
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
j3 the freedom of
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
Association um in your opinion um based
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
on the research you've done does this
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
section break any new ground legally or
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
is it reflection of what we have heard
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
described as uh uh court cases such as
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
the Rosenberger versus Virginia case
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
there is a um gay area in the RO in the
 
02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
legal precedence today and I
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
specifically refer to the allc Commerce
 
02:54:34.349 --> 02:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
policy that currently even though that's
 
02:54:36.229 --> 02:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
a precedent that's likely to be
 
02:54:39.309 --> 02:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
overturned at some point right now it is
 
02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
still the law of the land that all
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce policies are legal and the
 
02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
intent of that section the 188 j3 is
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
really to make it clear that we do not
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
allow all Commerce policies because of
 
02:54:54.510 --> 02:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
the fact they basically destroy the
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
right to free association again think
 
02:55:00.229 --> 02:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
about any organization you belong to
 
02:55:02.670 --> 02:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
imagine it with a all Commerce
 
02:55:05.790 --> 02:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
policy would it still
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
work any organization depends on picking
 
02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
who its members are and making sure
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
those members share something in common
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
that makes the organization beneficial
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
to everybody and so on any organization
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
any club anything if you would apply an
 
02:55:24.750 --> 02:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
all Commerce policy to it and anybody
 
02:55:27.790 --> 02:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
could join would be useless it would
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
just be used for you know by the
 
02:55:32.590 --> 02:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
majority to stop any minority from
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
expressing their points of view and from
 
02:55:37.550 --> 02:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
having a place where they can talk about
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
topics that are not necessarily the
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
majority point of view so I would say
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
that definitely that section is needed
 
02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
because right now the allomer policies
 
02:55:51.150 --> 02:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
are legally still on the table and I
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate again the commitment of the
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
University that they are not going to be
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
they're not being considered right now
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
and they don't have them but they would
 
02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
be allowed to bring them up in the
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
future if the points of view of the
 
02:56:04.590 --> 02:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
administration changes and I don't think
 
02:56:07.389 --> 02:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
that should be an option you know uh the
 
02:56:09.229 --> 02:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
we got in this issue of freedom of
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
Association has just rung some bells for
 
02:56:15.070 --> 02:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
myself when little confusion here
 
02:56:19.870 --> 02:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
if we have a Greek Greek fraternity on
 
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
campus and it's an agricultural oriented
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
fraternity with the chapter requirements
 
02:56:29.349 --> 02:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
that to be a member of this fraternity
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture if Mr cordelli beside me
 
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
here wants as a student to come in and
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
join that he may be majoring in history
 
02:56:45.389 --> 02:56:45.399 align:start position:0%
science political science
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
can that fraternity say no you can't
 
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
associate with us the intent of that of
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
that proposed legislation is to make
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
sure that any student organization has
 
02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to choose who can join yes
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
and while I would
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
personally say that if they are really
 
02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
interested in agriculture the
 
02:57:08.110 --> 02:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that you actually have a
 
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
degree on it is kind of silly because
 
02:57:11.389 --> 02:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of farmers who never go
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
past high school and they know more
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
about agriculture than most people the
 
02:57:19.870 --> 02:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
fact is that once you start taking away
 
02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
the ability of an student organization
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
to choose who it is a
 
02:57:27.870 --> 02:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
member most associations are just going
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
to become whatever the majority wants
 
02:57:31.469 --> 02:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
and we have to protect every point of
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
view I don't think you're answering my
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
question I apologize yeah it's a in fact
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is a fraternity down UNH right now
 
02:57:42.590 --> 02:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
with this very issue that it's built
 
02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
upon those which are
 
02:57:48.429 --> 02:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
majoring in that area in that program
 
02:57:48.439 --> 02:57:49.349 align:start position:0%
majoring in that area in that program
and

02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
their their their life their environment
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
the the way they work with each other is
 
02:57:58.630 --> 02:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
contingent upon that background and that
 
02:58:00.429 --> 02:58:00.439 align:start position:0%
learning that they're getting through
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
UNH yes should we then allow that be
 
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
watered down other words I'm just saying
 
02:58:09.950 --> 02:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
that I if if there's a
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that an organization does
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
require your saying that no you can
 
02:58:17.550 --> 02:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
bypass that requirement and you can
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
associate and I don't think that's no no
 
02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
no no I'm saying that the organization
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
any student organization should be able
 
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
to set their criteria and be allowed to
 
02:58:29.469 --> 02:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
exist and be allowed to set those
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for entry if anything I'm
 
02:58:34.830 --> 02:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
opposing I I'm supporting the rights of
 
02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
any student organization to choose who
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
can be a member regardless of what their
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
criteria may be
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
because it's really what the freedom of
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
Association is all about the right to
 
02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
associate with like-minded people that
 
02:58:48.670 --> 02:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
want to associate with me I want to
 
02:58:50.910 --> 02:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
associate with them so this would be to
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
protect that type of
 
02:58:55.950 --> 02:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
organization if this legislation would
 
02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
be passed the university would not have
 
02:58:59.550 --> 02:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to go to them and say you
 
02:59:02.229 --> 02:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
have to change your rules for membership
 
02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
or else we'll take your chapter away
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
02:59:10.429 --> 02:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
represent Damon thank you very much has
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
the ACLU expressed an opinion on this
 
02:59:16.750 --> 02:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
bill I appreciate the reminder I I knew
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
that I miss something regardless of how
 
02:59:22.429 --> 02:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
long my original speech was last year as
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
you do know the ACLU did support the HB
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
516 um right now I'm still in
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with them because the
 
02:59:34.830 --> 02:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
ACLU representative who was responsible
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
for this bill moved to a different
 
02:59:41.710 --> 02:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
chapter and I just started talking to um
 
02:59:46.150 --> 02:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
Jill Bonet about the bill and I think we
 
02:59:48.990 --> 02:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I would right now they did not have
 
02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
time to go through their process and
 
02:59:53.550 --> 02:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate it but I did start the process
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I definitely expect that by the time
 
02:59:57.790 --> 02:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
the executive session is scheduled I
 
03:00:00.670 --> 03:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
should have a clear answer from the ACU
 
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
and if I was a betting man I would bet
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
on the ACLU supporting it because it is
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
essentially unchanged from a bill a
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
supported last year but at this point in
 
03:00:12.510 --> 03:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
time they did not have time to reach a
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
decision so I don't want claim either
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
way but I am talking to them and I will
 
03:00:19.349 --> 03:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
definitely follow up to the committee as
 
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
soon as uh progress is made there thank
 
03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
you okay I think we are done right here
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
now um I'm getting eyes down here like
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
challenging don't stop it I I heard from
 
03:00:34.990 --> 03:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
you representative cascaden and and uh
 
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
so at that with this I'm gonna I don't
 
03:00:41.790 --> 03:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
have any more pain cards thanks and so
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative if you could work with
 
03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
the university system if there I see the
 
03:00:52.389 --> 03:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
changes you've made with the the the uh
 
03:00:55.309 --> 03:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
organizations and the damages if there's
 
03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
anything else you can come closer
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
together give it a shot absolutely this
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't have to be out of here till
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
February 15th it is an early Bill thank
 
03:01:04.910 --> 03:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
you so we have 23 of them in this
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
committee that's why we have to move
 
03:01:08.229 --> 03:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
quickly on them so I'm going to close
 
03:01:09.950 --> 03:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing on
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
1305 and the hearing on the next bill
 
03:01:16.469 --> 03:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
here uh will be at 1:00 we are going to
 
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
take a
 
03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:42.630 align:start position:0%
take a
break

03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:45:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
which ones are those we already
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
got why just want a crisscross one put
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
them somewhere it we ask later
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
okay we're ready to go with part two of
 
03:45:50.199 --> 03:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay we're ready to go with part two of
today's

03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
today's
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
session which is dealing with some bill
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
from the morning we're going to be
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
starting with 1657 which is relative to
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
prohibiting hazing at educational
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
institutions and we have representative
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
Greg Hill that's
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
willingly offered to produc the bill I
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't think I'd go that far Mr chairman
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
but um willingly willingly is the
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
operative word um so I will introduce
 
03:46:23.229 --> 03:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
1657 FN and let you know that I have uh
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
in my possession and maybe in your
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
possession now um it is um an amendment
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
that I believe replaces all or I've been
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
led to believe replace is all of the
 
03:46:40.640 --> 03:46:41.910 align:start position:0%
led to believe replace is all of the
original

03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill and I have a prepared
 
03:46:50.590 --> 03:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
statement um from the sponsor who is in
 
03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:51.630 align:start position:0%
statement um from the sponsor who is in
law

03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
school um full-time this week and cannot
 
03:46:57.870 --> 03:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
miss any but appreciate representative
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hill introducing uh 1657 for me and this
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
has taking questions but it's wrong
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
um are there any Pearls of Wisdom in
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
there there are
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually okay let's go so this says uh
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill updates the language that
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
would that prohibits hazing at
 
03:47:20.189 --> 03:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
educational institutions this bill is
 
03:47:22.590 --> 03:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
similar to bills passed in other states
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
such as Washington Virginia Ohio and New
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
Jersey and with many other states
 
03:47:29.710 --> 03:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
introducing legislation to move in
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
similar directions the amendment is a
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
compromise with uh University system and
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
administration members from UNH Keane
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth who met with me meaning um
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
cam representative cam Kenny uh met with
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
me to discuss language that would make
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
the bill workable in New Hampshire I
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
will briefly go over the amendment and
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
point out the substantial changes that
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
it brings to the
 
03:48:01.710 --> 03:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
bill um page one until page two line 22
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
it offers straightforward
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
definitions the only significant
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
difference between the bill and the
 
03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
Amendments is line 21 through 22 on page
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
two that defines student organization
 
03:48:17.710 --> 03:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
which makes it clear the organization is
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
formally recognized by an educational
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
institution as there are examples of
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
unrecognized organizations that the
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
institutions cannot act
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
upon uh second one is page two line 33
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
Begins the section that implements
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
educational programs at the educational
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
institutions this section is different
 
03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
and more workable than the original Bill
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
based off recommendations from the
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
University system and the
 
03:48:50.189 --> 03:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
institutions in the amendment the
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
institutions are given the burden to
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
provide an educational program regarding
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
hazing initially the student could be
 
03:49:01.710 --> 03:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
penalized for not participating by not
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
being allowed to participate in
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
recognized organizations until they
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
complete the educational training but
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
this could have a counterproductive
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
impact such as incentivizing students to
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
join unrecognized groups additionally I
 
03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
realized that after the meeting it would
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
really not work in practice but as page
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
three line four to six shows the
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
institution would still verify what
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
students participate therefore this
 
03:49:36.149 --> 03:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
language still provides an educational
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
program on hazing while ensuring that
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
student students participate without
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
prompting unintended
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
consequences page three line 17 offers
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
language that has to do with
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
institutions reporting hazing
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
violations after the amendment each
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
institution will offer an annual public
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
report on known hazing
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
violations the amendment adds the
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that the report will also
 
03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
State the number or percentage of
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
students that participated in the
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
educational program I previously
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned from the last
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
section the last Point worth mentioning
 
03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
is that this report will be included on
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
the institution's website as shown on
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
2-10 page line uh page four line 27
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
amends RSA 631 colon 7 which regards
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
penalty for
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
hazing on the amendment Page 6 line 8
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
makes it clearer when compared to the
 
03:50:40.319 --> 03:50:41.790 align:start position:0%
makes it clearer when compared to the
original

03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
Bill oh um page six makes it clearer
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
when compared to the original bill that
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
the intent for penalization is for those
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
who specifically engage in the act of
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
hazing this section specifies that
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
aggravated hazing which is hazing that
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
results in serious bodily injury or
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
death Page 6 line
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
9-10 is a class B felony Page 6 Line2 1
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
all other hazing is a
 
03:51:15.750 --> 03:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor the last relevant section I
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
believe could use clarification comes at
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
page 7 line 10- 15 misdemeanors have a
 
03:51:26.189 --> 03:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
one-year statute of limitations after
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
talking with the university system
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
institutions it would be beneficial to
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
have a statue of limitations at four
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
years so that is where the new section
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
comes from when compared to the original
 
03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:40.030 align:start position:0%
comes from when compared to the original
bill

03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
I believe the rest of the bill is
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory sorry again for not
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
being present to take
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions but representative Hill is
 
03:51:50.670 --> 03:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
willing to take
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
questions as it is those who help me as
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%

committee Tom Cronin uh with the
 
03:52:55.870 --> 03:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
university system thank you for having
 
03:52:58.149 --> 03:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
us in on House Bill
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
1657 uh so as representative Hill
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
explained a moment ago we did reach out
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
to representative Kenny when we first
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
saw this in the system uh just to have a
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
conversation with him about what his
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
intentions were and where he wanted to
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
go and then had a couple of very
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
productive meetings with them on just
 
03:53:13.149 --> 03:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
how to make legislation like this a
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more workable for the
 
03:53:16.950 --> 03:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
campuses uh with the amendment the
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
university system is strongly in support
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill we think it strengthens the
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
state's hazing laws increases hazing
 
03:53:23.670 --> 03:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
prevention education in both
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
post-secondary as well as secondary
 
03:53:27.269 --> 03:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
education which we think is is really
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
important um and then allows us to
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
develop sort of consistent reporting
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
requirements across the state um I I'm
 
03:53:35.229 --> 03:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions I do think
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hill really did hit some
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
of our key points I'll quickly reiterate
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
at them uh really one of the biggest
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
concerns we have was the original draft
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
would have prevented any student from
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
participating in any University
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
activities until they had completed the
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
training that is just impossible for us
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce on an open college campus we
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
could not in any way prevent a student
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
from going out and doing something so
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
instead we really sort of took the
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
approach that other legislation think
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
specifically uh the sexual harassment
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislation from a few years AG go takes
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
that puts the uh burden on the campuses
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
to provide a program of Education within
 
03:54:09.790 --> 03:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think the first 30 days
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
um I we also talked with Cam or
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny a little bit about
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
the idea of you know reporting on the
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
participation in those just to ensure
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
that you all lawmakers are aware that we
 
03:54:20.590 --> 03:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
are offering it we're doing our best to
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
ensure students are taking it and I want
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
to be clear too a lot of what we're
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
doing in this case is thing are things
 
03:54:28.229 --> 03:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
we already do we already include a
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
module on training we already on
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
particularly for fraternity and sorority
 
03:54:35.309 --> 03:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
websites report instances where they've
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
had disciplinary issues so a lot of the
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
stuff that's in this is just sort of
 
03:54:40.389 --> 03:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
being aggregated into things we're kind
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
of doing already um let me see two
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
others uh the initial draft of the bill
 
03:54:50.790 --> 03:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
had us reporting uh semiannually twice a
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
year the amendment would change that to
 
03:54:56.149 --> 03:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
annual annual is also how we do our
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
current crime reporting clearly for
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
folks who have heard that before there's
 
03:55:01.389 --> 03:55:01.399 align:start position:0%
also Federal legislation on this issue
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
that if it were to pass would require
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
annual reporting uh so our thought there
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
was just to align with those other items
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
and then the length the statute of
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
limitations is actually something that
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
came from the University uh not a lawyer
 
03:55:17.429 --> 03:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
um the you my understanding is a a
 
03:55:20.189 --> 03:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
typical misdemeanor has a one-year Class
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor has a one-year statute of
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
limitations hazing unfortunately is a
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
crime that when it's committed
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's told to keep quiet and we've
 
03:55:29.309 --> 03:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately had instances you know
 
03:55:31.389 --> 03:55:31.399 align:start position:0%
over a number of years where folks have
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
come in and reported something either
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
that they saw maybe were involved with
 
03:55:37.950 --> 03:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh but after that year and then we've
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately lost to the the ability to
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know pursue that criminally um
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
certainly still take them through
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
student conduct Etc but by lengthening
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
it to four years kind of creates a
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of more opportunity there to
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
hold folks accountable uh if they're
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
involved in this sort of activity those
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
are again the the three uh three big
 
03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
ones representative Hill did mention
 
03:55:58.269 --> 03:55:58.279 align:start position:0%
recognize organizations that was also a
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
helpful edit um but we'd be happy to
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
take questions I think thank you very
 
03:56:05.070 --> 03:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
much uh Mr Cronin um I I have a question
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily policy but it is
 
03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:10.389 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily policy but it is
finance

03:56:10.389 --> 03:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
finance
 
03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
did you or working with others within
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the system or
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
Systems address the issue that this bill
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
could cost as much as
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
$400,000 uh so part of the FN certainly
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
in in drafting the FN was related to uh
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
the couple pieces we need on ensuring
 
03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
the annual or the biannual reporting so
 
03:56:34.269 --> 03:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier under the amendment
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh I think at one of our three
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
institutions we would need to develop
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
the module that would need to be offered
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
still so there is a little bit of
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
startup cost there so yes there
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
certainly is a little bit of added cost
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
to the Mandate for sure but we think
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's one that's worth undertaking and
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
was the University system or community
 
03:56:55.870 --> 03:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
college system going to take that money
 
03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
from their Surplus fund or are they
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to come from us and ask us I I do
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
not expect it will be included in our
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
state appropriation request next year
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe some of the other bills
 
03:57:09.189 --> 03:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative Myer
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
being here what is uh my question is
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's a
 
03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
simple one what is the incident rate
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
right now of hazing on the on your three
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
College Camp yeah I appreciate you
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
asking uh very limited uh thankfully
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
certainly you know you you don't want to
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
ever minimize the idea that there's such
 
03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
a thing as minor hazing there are
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
obviously instances of things that
 
03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
particularly as written in this
 
03:57:35.710 --> 03:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislation would probably rise to that
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
definition um but in terms of sort of B
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
big incidences I think at the University
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's been one maybe in the last three
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
or four years uh I think Keen State
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state would probably say about
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
the same this issue of recognized
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
unrecognized organizations is in fact a
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
concern uh there are a couple of
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
unrecognized fraternities and sororities
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
at the University a couple also at keen
 
03:57:57.389 --> 03:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth where it's a little bit
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
harder to sort of police the activity of
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
the group versus the students um the
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
other thing I would also add too is you
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
know in working on this with
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny and our team there
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
is still an issue of you know activity
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
that could constitute hazing happening
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
in clubs in sports in other areas too it
 
03:58:17.469 --> 03:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
is not exclusively a Greek life issue
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
but again to issues that rise to
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
criminal complaints very very limited I
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
would say less than a half a dozen
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
across the system over the last three or
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
four years followup please a followup
 
03:58:30.870 --> 03:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
would be is how do you um get the word
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
out you said you already addressing this
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
within the institution what's the
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
process you use to make this If This
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
Were become law how would you then get
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
this word out to students uh the way we
 
03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
do it now and the way the bill speaks to
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
it is as part of your orientation
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
process so all students are involved in
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
orientation so it is just part of the
 
03:58:52.630 --> 03:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
the training modules that a student goes
 
03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
through during orientation if you are
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
involved in Greek life it's regular
 
03:58:58.269 --> 03:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
training on that side um and then
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
similar you know again mentioning the
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
the sexual harassment legislation
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
similar to if if it becomes a more
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
prevalent requirement email social media
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
Etc to ensure folks are aware that it's
 
03:59:10.110 --> 03:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
there and
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
required further questions represent
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
for helping us understand the
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
spell your remarks a moment ago about
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
the low incidence of hazing was that
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
specific to the university system or to
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
all educational institutions in new I'm
 
03:59:29.790 --> 03:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
usnh if I may yep I just want to clarify
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
the bill does apply to public and
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
private institutions and I think the
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
incidence is different it may
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
be representative beler and then
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
 
03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering these
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions for us um a lot of this stuff
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense some of it seems a
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
little difficult to find it seems pretty
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
broad um so looking at lines um say 20
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
one and then 22 substantial risk of
 
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
emotional harm can you offer it what
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
page page one one one 21 and 22
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
lines uh substantial risk of emotional
 
04:00:11.840 --> 04:00:13.349 align:start position:0%
lines uh substantial risk of emotional
harm

04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
harm
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
um how how would that be defined in law
 
04:00:18.550 --> 04:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
would that would that include like just
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
anxiety I'm not sure exactly sure it's a
 
04:00:23.469 --> 04:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
good question we I'll say we rais that
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
as a question we didn't have a great fix
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
for it in this first round and I I'll be
 
04:00:29.229 --> 04:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
clear too we are happy to continue
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
working on representative Kenny's
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to to better clarify items
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
like that and if I may just one one more
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
on on that same uh line of thought line
 
04:00:40.080 --> 04:00:42.269 align:start position:0%
on on that same uh line of thought line
27

04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
27
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
um exclusion from social contact now
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I I can understand how under
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances that would be
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
interpreted rightly but also we were
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
just hearing before lunch about Supreme
 
04:00:56.510 --> 04:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
Court and the idea of being a of student
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
groups being able to exclude dependent
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
on their own beliefs and alignment with
 
04:01:02.590 --> 04:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
that group so wouldn't it wouldn't it be
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentally true that a student might
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
apply to a student group and not meet
 
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and by definition be
 
04:01:13.630 --> 04:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
excluded from social contact in that
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
group I think we're talking about two
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
different issues in a in essentially the
 
04:01:20.469 --> 04:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
criminal definition of hazing versus
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
potentially joining a student
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
organization thank you represent
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering a
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
little bit in asking this question
 
04:01:38.670 --> 04:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is almost almost too
 
04:01:41.710 --> 04:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
defined in some ways about the student
 
04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
group thing or maybe not specifically I
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
am a former member of a college
 
04:01:50.429 --> 04:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
fraternity and they did do very mild
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
hazing others did more extensive hazing
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
but the athletes also did hazing who
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
were not parts
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
of fraternal groups and so I don't see
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
any reference here and these were
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
Varsity athletes on each other and
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes they were very physical yeah
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
no so organization so looking at the
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
amendment page two line 9 I think is
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
pretty broad for exactly that reason uh
 
04:02:20.189 --> 04:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
included okay that that just really
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
concern that's my concern 100% are there
 
04:02:27.550 --> 04:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Cronin yes
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
representa dry thank you so how much
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
does this change what's already on your
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
books right now about hazing or between
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
what's on our books and act and how
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're currently
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
doing this not a lot again I think uh
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
for I forget if it was Kean or Plymouth
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
one of our one of the organizations in
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
the system would need to develop that
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
training module in order to come into
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
compliance they are already doing
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
training I think this would by doing it
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
through the module be able to track the
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
statistics things like that uh in terms
 
04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
of reporting we already report to law
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement which is one of the
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
requirements in here in terms of
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
reporting publicly we as I said report
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
at least on fraternities and sororities
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
publicly on their Pages uh training is
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
already there
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh again the the change on the statute
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
of limitations gives us that ability to
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
report to law enforcement longer which
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate but in terms of day
 
04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
to-day activity it would be pretty
 
04:03:21.070 --> 04:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
similar follow up just real quick that
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
can you talk about misdemeanor again
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations so it changes the
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
time that you can act on it but it
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't if you report after a year you
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would you be able to go after
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
again uh good question for I wish cam as
 
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the Judiciary Committee was
 
04:03:38.469 --> 04:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
here my understanding is a Class B
 
04:03:40.269 --> 04:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor has a one-year statute of
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
limitation so we have had instances
 
04:03:43.630 --> 04:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
where a student has come and reported an
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
instance of hazing uh alleged hazing
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
after that one year and at that point
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
reporting to to law enforcement there's
 
04:03:53.469 --> 04:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
no value that we still work through the
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
student conduct uh process assuming the
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
student is still there the accused
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
student is still there we would work
 
04:04:01.469 --> 04:04:01.479 align:start position:0%
through that regardless of the legal
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
statute however by extending the legal
 
04:04:06.070 --> 04:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations to four years it
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
would give us a longer time to report to
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I do believe there's a
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill that we would
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
have to report to local law enforcement
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
within 72 hours of uh learning of
 
04:04:18.910 --> 04:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
alleged incident which is what we do
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
already uh it would just ensure that in
 
04:04:22.429 --> 04:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
the event that it has been kept quiet
 
04:04:24.269 --> 04:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
for whatever amount of time there's
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
still a legal Avenue there as well okay
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
questions not see any thank you very
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
you like to call um
 
04:04:42.349 --> 04:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
on this bill we
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
have Shannon Reed were you going to
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
04:04:46.199 --> 04:04:52.349 align:start position:0%
testify on this
one

04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon I'm Shannon Reed
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
representing the Community College this
 
04:04:56.279 --> 04:04:57.349 align:start position:0%
representing the Community College this
New

04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire excuse me I've been trying to
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
sort of toggle through the bill has
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
introduced and the amended version which
 
04:05:05.309 --> 04:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
I've really just been able to take a
 
04:05:10.110 --> 04:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
look at um um today so my testimony is
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
directed at the original version of the
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill but I'll try to kind of morph it
 
04:05:16.750 --> 04:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
into discussing the amendment to the
 
04:05:19.229 --> 04:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
extent I've been able to um review it so
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
we certainly believe that this is a
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill but we would
 
04:05:23.870 --> 04:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
oppose it as as
 
04:05:26.830 --> 04:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
introduced um and I'll outline a few
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
reasons and I I will say at the outset
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
that my testimony is going to be a bit
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
parochial in that it's going to be
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
specific to the community college
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
experience of hazing um but I understand
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
that this Bill also applies to the
 
04:05:41.309 --> 04:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
public four-year colleges private
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
colleges and um the secondary level of
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
Education as well so we already have
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
well established policies on hazing um
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
including that any such incidents must
 
04:05:54.670 --> 04:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
be treated as violations of college
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
policy and also a New Hampshire's
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
criminal code reporting requirements
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
already exist including reporting to law
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement and making reports publicly
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
available and accessible on an ongoing
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
basis U we we publish a a log which we
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
keep um accessible to anyone who wants
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
to see it um and this would be part of
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
that that said we have had no reported
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
instances of hazing in recent memory
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
going back for at least a decade as I've
 
04:06:22.510 --> 04:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
been able to discern talking to my
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
system um certain requirements of this
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill would necessitate hiring additional
 
04:06:31.389 --> 04:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel these include implementing and
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
tracking the training program and
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
preventing students from participating
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
in campus activities or events and until
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
they complete The Hazing training and I
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
I understand that's been addressed in
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'd like a chance to take
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
a look and make sure that it does in
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
fact um alleviate um our compliance cost
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
concerns on that score um costs
 
04:06:53.189 --> 04:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill would have to
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
be met by moving resources away from
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
other areas of of operational need um we
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
have a number of questions I haven't
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
been able to kind of review in enough
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
detail but the reporting piece of the
 
04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill and of the Amendment um could be
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
certainly workable based on what we're
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently doing um but the specificity
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the bill might create some privacy
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns where we have small
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
organizations if there was an incident
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
it might be it might be difficult
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
to um protect privacy interest while
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
still meeting the reporting elements
 
04:07:27.309 --> 04:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
that are in the Bill we need to take a
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I'm I'm trying to kind of
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
go between the the the bill and the
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendment we had some questions that are
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
similar to represented bels with respect
 
04:07:41.309 --> 04:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
to some of the language being um
 
04:07:42.910 --> 04:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
potentially a little too vague and Broad
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
like Behavior which adversely affects
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of the individual
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad um phrase and that
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
could be in the eye of the beholder and
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
I could imagine a I don't know an
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
athletic um training regimen that
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
somebody felt they didn't want to do
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
because it adversely affected their
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
health and safety which may or may not
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
you know be legitimately the case so I
 
04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
would want to just find potentially
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
refine some of the language so I would
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
look forward to the opportunity to
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
continue to work with the sponsors and
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
um my colleagues at the University
 
04:08:17.109 --> 04:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
system to just make sure that the
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have that would create
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
additional costs that were not um in the
 
04:08:26.590 --> 04:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
end really helpful um to the whole area
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
of of hazing prevention um in in a final
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
version happy to take any
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um in my reading of
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
this I'm on page
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
two sorry the amendment or the bill of
 
04:08:39.479 --> 04:08:41.149 align:start position:0%
two sorry the amendment or the bill of
the

04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
amendment page
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
two line nine where it says Romans 8
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
says organization means a club
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
Association Corporation order Society
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
core private club fraternity sorority
 
04:09:00.269 --> 04:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
Varity or Club Athletic team etc etc
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
what about JV team what about a freshman
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
team um it it seems that this is only
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to be applicable to your varsity
 
04:09:14.109 --> 04:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
team that's an interesting observation
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
it does seem to skip over from Varsity
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
to Club yeah I mean you know I think
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
we'd like a chance to take a really
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
close read yeah and the second question
 
04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
I have and then I'll because just a
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
cursory look too or thought when we're
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
talking about private 9 through 12
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
schools private
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
Collegiate High uh higher education
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
schools and there's a cost to doing this
 
04:09:40.750 --> 04:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
where is the money coming for those
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
private institutions or is this an
 
04:09:42.520 --> 04:09:45.189 align:start position:0%
private institutions or is this an
unfunded

04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
mandate I think it probably would meet a
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
definition of an unfunded mandate if
 
04:09:51.309 --> 04:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
this gets passed and there are costs
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
that have to be met uh I think that's
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
the case for any type of institution
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
yeah are there further questions from
 
04:10:02.189 --> 04:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
itself not seeing any thank you very
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
much was there any body else out there
 
04:10:12.030 --> 04:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
now and in looking at this bill it's
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
going to take you know more
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
work and most likely some kind of a
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if we see the need to move
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
now the next one on the
 
04:10:40.640 --> 04:10:42.510 align:start position:0%
now the next one on the
agenda

04:10:42.510 --> 04:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
is hb1
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
1450 that's a bill that I have um I can
 
04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
introduce it right now we should be able
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
to get done this in about five minutes
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
and then get back on on schedule so
 
04:11:03.870 --> 04:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
that 1450
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:12.149 align:start position:0%
that 1450
1450

04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open the hearing on House
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 1450 establishing relative to
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission on higher
 
04:11:20.159 --> 04:11:22.309 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission on higher
education

04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
consolidation and I believe um we have
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
out and
 
04:11:35.109 --> 04:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
um it's all yours uh chairman lad thank
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
you um you're going to have materials
 
04:11:39.309 --> 04:11:39.319 align:start position:0%
coming around and briefly I'll just give
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of explanation where
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
we're coming from the sheet you're going
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
to re receive has the first three pages
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
show the governor's executive order for
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the task force which is studying the
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
Strategic alignment a public uh higher
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
education in New
 
04:11:59.229 --> 04:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so I don't think there's
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
any need I think some of us have looked
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
at that before um but there are certain
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
tasks that this task force is looking at
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
and per uh already in the business
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the issue uh that the the
 
04:12:15.760 --> 04:12:16.750 align:start position:0%
looking at the issue uh that the the
governor

04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:12:19.229 --> 04:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
addresses and the task force shall
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
consist of you can see on that who's a
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
member of that
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
commission and and there are certain
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
requirements or tasks which the
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee is asked to
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
do and those are on the second page of
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's um
 
04:12:37.760 --> 04:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
the governor's um
executive

04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
order there's tasks shall be A and
 
04:12:43.399 --> 04:12:44.910 align:start position:0%
order there's tasks shall be A and
B

04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
B
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
and C solicit input from V variety of
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which that group's proba
 
04:12:52.590 --> 04:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
already doing the bill which I
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
introduced was introduced at the same
 
04:12:57.030 --> 04:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
time this was put together the
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
governor's task force has all that has
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
to have all their work done and
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
March from my perspective I think that's
 
04:13:10.349 --> 04:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely there's just a lot to be
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
done and I'll go through a few of those
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
things so what we did is we put a bill
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
in I put a bill in that would be a
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
placeholder in case there are
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations you can look at the
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
title of it it's not about merger not
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
about merger at all it's looking at how
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
we can align this whole structure to
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
meet some of these responsibilities that
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
the the governor's order says we should
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
be looking at and my bill say the same
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
has same identical language in
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
it so the fourth sheet down is a
 
04:13:50.109 --> 04:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
timeline in which the task force has to
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
meet you can see they've already started
 
04:13:53.950 --> 04:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
we've already started meeting on January
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
5th and had in January 12th which will
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
be coming up this Friday and you see in
 
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
that in accordance that we should be
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere close to getting done in
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
March um it's of a a hope and a pray um
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
the next sheet down looks at some of the
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
challenges which we're looking at which
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
deals with Public School uh enrollment
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
currently and you can see from that
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
chart starting back in uh 20022 2003
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
school year going down to
 
04:14:30.189 --> 04:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
22-23 school year what the trend line
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Looks like in our state we are losing
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
students K through 12 that has a direct
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
relationship ship to what's happening in
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
the Collegiate level not just in New
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but throughout New
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
England to our
 
04:14:48.109 --> 04:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
students more competition to get these
 
04:14:50.910 --> 04:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
students you we're we're we're fighting
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
other schools like
 
04:14:56.109 --> 04:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
UMass uh University of mass amris and L
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
students and then the next sheet is a
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
sheet which shows challenges of year
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
student enrollment projections you can
 
04:15:12.030 --> 04:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
see on that sheet it looks like this
 
04:15:12.040 --> 04:15:13.389 align:start position:0%
see on that sheet it looks like this
right

04:15:13.389 --> 04:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:13.399 --> 04:15:15.550 align:start position:0%
right
here

04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you can see what the projections
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
look like in year
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
28 look at that trend line it's going to
 
04:15:22.800 --> 04:15:24.030 align:start position:0%
28 look at that trend line it's going to
get

04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
worse that in fact will have a direct
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
relationship with tuition monies coming
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
in that in fact will challenge the
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
system to try and retain some of these
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
students which are leaving our state to
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
go to school elsewhere to keep them in
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
our state that's why we have to work
 
04:15:43.710 --> 04:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
with the community college system the
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
university system together the community
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
college system with the the 2 plus two
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
program other programs which they
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
haven't learned including concurrent
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment get students involved in
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
it there hopefully they'll continue
 
04:16:00.990 --> 04:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
through with the higher ed four-year
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
program there's many many issues which
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that that committee is um tasked to do
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
this the next sheet down is a sheet that
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
comes from the community college
 
04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
system supporting New Hampshire's
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
communities and Workforce 93 93% of our
 
04:16:19.469 --> 04:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
students are New Hampshire residents
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful in the community
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
college system you see where we're
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
pulling from we're pulling from adults
 
04:16:26.189 --> 04:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
in our community a student that's a
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
little older than it is for the four
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
fouryear system campuses through New
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serve communities and support
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
local employers and industries and
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
really tied tightly together with the
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
small business and business in our state
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
trying to adapt and mold towards where
 
04:16:44.429 --> 04:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
we want a Workforce to be now and in the
 
04:16:46.750 --> 04:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
future and as it was stated earlier
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
today I think uh uh Miss Reed uh talked
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
about 21,000 22,000 students in the
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
community college system you're right on
 
04:16:56.349 --> 04:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and and it's done through these skill
 
04:16:59.840 --> 04:17:01.469 align:start position:0%
um and and it's done through these skill
certificate

04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
programs but we got of dat this you know
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about even with the fouryear
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
system of train transitioning students
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
from one to the other without loss of
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
credit without loss of time without loss
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
of money these are all tasks which the
 
04:17:17.109 --> 04:17:17.119 align:start position:0%
systems going to have to look at and all
 
04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
points to governance too the last sheet
 
04:17:23.790 --> 04:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
there comes from the University
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
system and it shows you what the
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment of four-year college students
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
where they're going in our state you can
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
see the majority of our kids
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
56.4% leave the state then you can see
 
04:17:37.439 --> 04:17:38.149 align:start position:0%
56.4% leave the state then you can see
that

04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
27.7% go to the university
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
system and privates are
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
15.9% this is uh from the uh University
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire you can see the
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment changes which we which
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
obviously are
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
shrinking uh several wonderful points to
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
be looking at so we have a system that's
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
been very effective both at the
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
community college system level and the
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
university system level that's why I'm
 
04:18:06.510 --> 04:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
not really supportive any kind of merger
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
but am supportive that we got to look at
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
how we're going to continue funding this
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
where we're going to get our students
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
how we're going to keep our margin in in
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
the profit range rather than having uh
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
more expenses than we are revenues
 
04:18:20.910 --> 04:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's also reflected on a St State uh
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
sheet how to reduce the student uh
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
tuition costs uh if we want to attract
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
students to stay in the state we're
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to do something about
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
reduce reducing those
 
04:18:35.229 --> 04:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
costs um on the other side you can see
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
the uh average net price of attendance
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire undergrads um in
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
comparison to those private Cent State
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh un PSU in ke keing state are down
 
04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
lower uh you can see the cost there in
 
04:18:51.389 --> 04:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
that right H Kong some of the
 
04:18:53.070 --> 04:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we have to look at in
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
terms of this higher education study
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee are listed there and in the
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
risk areas of enrollment and facilities
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure when you have uh
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
seven community colleges and three now
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
four-year systems
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of facilities we look a
 
04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
lot of uh Capital costs out there and
 
04:19:13.710 --> 04:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with uh deferred
 
04:19:15.389 --> 04:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
maintenance we're dealing with a lot of
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
issues we need to be looking at how
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
to operate more
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
efficiently and and and and uh while
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate not adequate but a
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
superlative education for those students
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
which are working into Pathways here in
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
our state so the bill is set aside as a
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
a placeholder to support the task force
 
04:19:45.790 --> 04:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
that is currently looking at this and
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
currently the last meeting we had
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
represent Lun you're on that task force
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking at who are the
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that we have to get
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
information back
 
04:19:56.990 --> 04:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
from Educators yes students yes
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
administrators yes um uh so many
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
different people are involved in that
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
whole process uh so we have to do a lot
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
of research and a lot of gathering of
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
information uh then move forward with
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
some solid recommendations and there are
 
04:20:16.750 --> 04:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
those on that task force would like to
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
see some solid Progressive
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations rather than just kicking
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
the can down the road a little bit and
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of that and we've done
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
some wonderful things you know the 1530
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
which was representative Ford's bill
 
04:20:32.349 --> 04:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
here a few years back where we looked at
 
04:20:35.149 --> 04:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
trying to coordinate the career Pathways
 
04:20:38.109 --> 04:20:38.119 align:start position:0%
we have established 30 uh uh Pathways
 
04:20:40.269 --> 04:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
right now of which 10 we have it
 
04:20:43.109 --> 04:20:43.119 align:start position:0%
universally done now throughout but we
 
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
have to get those other 20 or closing in
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
on those as well those are just a few of
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
the things which were going to help us
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
create a more cost efficient system
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll conclude and I'm asking that we
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
just keep this as a placeholder until we
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
have to get rid of the bill and that
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
time we may know how to amend it with
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
some language of some kind so that we
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
can get it to the Senate so they'll have
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
it as placeholder as well if we act
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to rid that
 
04:21:14.349 --> 04:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
15 by March 15 right so we have some
 
04:21:22.590 --> 04:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
time there but if in fact the report
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
comes out from that group somewhere in
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
March by the end of March it's tight and
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so if we have some recommendations
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
to have to go forward that's when way
 
04:21:33.109 --> 04:21:33.119 align:start position:0%
that are going to need some legislative
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
support we can do
 
04:21:39.550 --> 04:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
it any questions for chairman
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
lad luno yeah thank you very much Mr
 
04:21:44.910 --> 04:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much um Rick
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
for um for putting this in because I
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
think this will provide a good vehicle
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
order yes your point representative Luna
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
referred to our speaker by his first
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
name oh oh I'll representative lad no
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine you're welcome
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
represent Luna no worries so yeah um um
 
04:22:09.149 --> 04:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
but um would you and I'm I'm not
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that we go ahead and
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
start amending this now no but uh but uh
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
but just as far as the title of the um
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill and the use of the
 
04:22:20.640 --> 04:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill and the use of the
word

04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
word
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
consolidation um and and you know maybe
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
a more something as as we do go forward
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
with it uh Commission on public higher
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
education systems because it really you
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
are correct and that title was put in by
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
the folks across the street okay and one
 
04:22:42.030 --> 04:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
of the things I talked with them when I
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
was discussing that said there are some
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
things for consolidating for example uh
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
president Dean down at UNH decided with
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
his staff they're going to move the
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
athletic training program the only
 
04:22:55.710 --> 04:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
athletic training program we have to
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University due to the
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
wellness center up there and their track
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
indoor track so that was a consolidation
 
04:23:04.750 --> 04:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
of programs he the program was put where
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
it was going to be more effective and
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
consolidating down to one one program in
 
04:23:12.349 --> 04:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
the state there's areas where we can
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
consol we've done it with law school
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely and those are absolutely
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
things which we got to look at
 
04:23:19.630 --> 04:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
consolidation is a bad word that has not
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
been a pleasant word for the community
 
04:23:22.830 --> 04:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
college system they're here they think
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
wow we're we're going to try to
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
eliminate that structure uh no I I feel
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
all these campuses serve as specific
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
purpose and it can be done but there are
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of efficiencies to scale and other
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
areas that we can address to make it run
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
so that we can run with the capital we
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
have and and also be reaching out and
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
and and and educating students the way
 
04:23:50.189 --> 04:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
we should be doing and are doing further
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Casen thank you
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative my questions are really
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify my understanding is that
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh the governor has issued this order
 
04:24:05.670 --> 04:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
for a task force and the reason for the
 
04:24:08.590 --> 04:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
bill is to ensure the task force does
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
its work I'm not really clear on when
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
you call it a placeholder I don't
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
understand what that means it's it's
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's not to ensure that they do their
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
work okay it's to if there are some
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations that come out of the
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
task force that can occur through
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation this is the bill or the
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
process to carry forward the
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations that come out of that
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
task force understood okay thank you
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
yeah anything further and that's what's
 
04:24:42.510 --> 04:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
been communicated with the college
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
presidents and in had a long discussion
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
with Mark Rubenstein over that and and
 
04:24:50.670 --> 04:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
so I think we're on that same
 
04:24:53.790 --> 04:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
page see no further questions uh thank
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
you representative and we'll close the
 
04:24:59.550 --> 04:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
1450 and we'll move on momentarily to
 
04:25:02.840 --> 04:25:05.070 align:start position:0%
1450 and we'll move on momentarily to
hb1

04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:28.030 align:start position:0%
hb1
1436

04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay I got one card on that 1436 but I
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
need to sponsor yeah
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:25:38.189 align:start position:0%
need to sponsor yeah
he's

04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
beler let me introduce our state the
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill first please um we have HB 1436 is
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
relative to in requiring institutions of
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
higher education to maintain certain
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
statistical information on their
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
websites and so I welcome representative
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
Belcher to introduce the
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
04:26:15.479 --> 04:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chair members of
the

04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee so I did not write this bill
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
so some of the more technical aspects of
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
it I may not be super useful like the
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
URL XML stuff but policy-wise I should
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do a fine job here the idea
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
of what this bill is meant to do is to
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
create trans transparency and openness
 
04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
that is available to all persons both
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
prospective students members of the
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.750 --> 04:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislature now we want to be able to
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
break out information we want to be able
 
04:26:50.640 --> 04:26:51.349 align:start position:0%
break out information we want to be able
to

04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
know what kind of debts students are
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
incurring in various uh disciplines what
 
04:27:02.670 --> 04:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
their job prospects are from various
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
disciplines um we believe that's
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
important both both for us as a society
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
because most of these institutions are
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
public they're publicly funded and also
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
for the students who can do
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
it now there was some consternation
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
about breaking certain demographics out
 
04:27:23.429 --> 04:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
information here's why it's so necessary
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this recently the
 
04:27:32.910 --> 04:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court issued a major ruling
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
striking down the practice of Harvard in
 
04:27:39.109 --> 04:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
their admissions process using something
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that Harvard was referring to as
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion as a part
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
of their on boarding of students now
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court said is that they
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
by having different standards for
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
different people based on immutable
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
characteristics like race and gender is
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
legal they said that is a violation of
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
civil rights
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:06.870 align:start position:0%
civil rights
law

04:28:06.870 --> 04:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
now in order to actually know if
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities are living up
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
to this ruling we have to be able to
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
break out this information to be able to
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
analyze it for us as a legislature for
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
the public for openness and also for
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
those who would be interested in
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
attending these universities because
 
04:28:29.670 --> 04:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
they have a right to know whether
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
certain people including themselves
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
might be subject to discrimination in
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
the process of being admitted or going
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
through these
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
programs and that's uh that's it in
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
nutshell I'll have you take questions
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for represent
 
04:28:46.830 --> 04:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
belter yes represent Tanner thank you
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question who
 
04:28:50.349 --> 04:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
actually wrote the Bill or does this
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
come from an organization no uh this was
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
Travis Coran uh representative Coran
 
04:28:55.520 --> 04:28:56.229 align:start position:0%
Travis Coran uh representative Coran
thank

04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
you representative cordelli uh thank you
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at lines 21
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh 20 and 21 um on page one of the
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill um average standardized test
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
scores um at the University level or
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
Community College level um what a what
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
standardized tests are you looking at
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
getting feedback on uh this would be
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores for um for
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.720 --> 04:29:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
utilized

04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
04:29:41.950 --> 04:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
so um like an SAT score um ACT score is
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
that what you're indicating yes what
 
04:29:45.870 --> 04:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the college is using
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
as far as a standardized test whatever
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
they're accepting for the admissions
 
04:29:50.950 --> 04:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
process and again this goes back to the
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling where they found
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
that Harvard the institution of Harvard
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
was applying different metrics using the
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
same tests by race and gender which was
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional go ahead
 
04:30:10.030 --> 04:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
um over on page two um lines four and
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
five you're looking for the employment
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
rate within the field of study within
 
04:30:17.109 --> 04:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
six months of
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
graduation from the
 
04:30:19.520 --> 04:30:21.349 align:start position:0%
graduation from the
program

04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:30:26.670 --> 04:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
um so how do you envision the um
 
04:30:28.590 --> 04:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
institution getting that
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
information um if the person moves out
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
of state accepts a job in California how
 
04:30:35.439 --> 04:30:36.830 align:start position:0%
of state accepts a job in California how
uh

04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:36.840 --> 04:30:37.870 align:start position:0%
uh
what

04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
um how are you going to collect this
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
information employment rate thank you
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um I believe it
 
04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
was the belief of uh rep corkran that
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
this would be done through a simple
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
graduates okay thank you other other
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
Ford how do we account for things that
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
seem more
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
anomalies than we think going in the
 
04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
example I have in mind is we graduate a
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
lot of people in
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
education and a lot of those people who
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
graduated education as it turns out are
 
04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
ideal candidates for management sales in
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
particular and that people are hired for
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
their people's skills that they
 
04:31:31.469 --> 04:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
developed in a program for teachers but
 
04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're hired to be salese in industry
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
and how do we then say geez they didn't
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
go into teaching but why they went into
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
something else but how does that get
 
04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
reflected in the numbers what's really
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
happening with those
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
graduates thank you for the question and
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
it's a good question strictly speaking
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
this would not track data from somebody
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
graduating from one program and going
 
04:31:58.389 --> 04:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
into a job and in in what would
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
traditionally be considered an unrelated
 
04:32:03.309 --> 04:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
field um it would only track those going
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
into a field that would be related to
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
their re
 
04:32:09.070 --> 04:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
program thank
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
you other questions from the committee
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you um
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
toward the top of the first page um uh
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
the institutions of Higher Learning have
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain information on a web page on
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
their website the institution's website
 
04:32:31.950 --> 04:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
I take it yes um on lines 10 and
 
04:32:35.309 --> 04:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
11 for that information You're Expecting
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
The the commissioner of the Department
 
04:32:41.550 --> 04:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
of Education to specify the font size
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
etc for the web page of the
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
college no I don't think there's any
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
necessity to to specify it I I think
 
04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's just saying that it has to be in
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know congruent to what is already
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
being used as a part of the website in
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
other words it just can't be tucked away
 
04:33:00.269 --> 04:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere in tiny font but that would be
 
04:33:03.029 --> 04:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner of the Department of
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
Education I'm sorry I'm not sure I
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
understand the question
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
04:33:09.629 --> 04:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
Education would monitor the font size
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.029 --> 04:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
suppose uh any other questions
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell and then repres
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
question um there's no fiscal note on
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
this and I can't imagine that it I
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
imagine it would cost the University or
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
the other systems a bit of money to do
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
something like
 
04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
this uh point is taken I would imagine
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
there would be a cost associate with
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
available a website I don't know what
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
that cost would be or why there would
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
surveys and tracking like for the
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire every year
 
04:33:53.709 --> 04:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's a large number of
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
graduates so trying to contact all of
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
time perhaps um to do a mailing or
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
something to that effect yeah there're
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
certainly would be a cost Associated I
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
don't know why there's no fiscal note
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
that certainly wasn't my
 
04:34:13.230 --> 04:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
doing representative McDonald thank you
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for presenting
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
this I do like the Merit of this bill
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
but as other committee members have
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out there might be some little
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
details that need to be changed and I
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
can see a few other places myself but
 
04:34:28.349 --> 04:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
how would you with a prime sponsor
 
04:34:31.150 --> 04:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
considering what has been said seek
 
04:34:32.429 --> 04:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
amending this
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
um frankly I I like the policy in it and
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm I'm signed on to this
 
04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
bill the more technical information in
 
04:34:48.910 --> 04:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
here is not my area of expertise so I
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would be useful to
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
amend or
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
not thank you represent
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you one more that I I
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
don't understand um in here um page two
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
lines 15 to 18
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the University or college has to
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
maintain at least 99% uptime monitored I
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
guess by somebody or reported by the
 
04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
college to to somebody but if they don't

status
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes presumably that's I don't know this
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
the the exact numbers that are sort of
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
incommon usage because again this is a
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
technical item and I'm not a technical
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
person when it comes to the the web
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
stuff but the idea would be that this
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
this can't be a usually under
 
04:35:46.590 --> 04:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
construction kind of website that isn't
 
04:35:48.670 --> 04:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
available to the
 
04:35:50.670 --> 04:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
public okay are there any more question
 
04:35:50.680 --> 04:35:52.510 align:start position:0%
public okay are there any more question
repres

04:35:52.510 --> 04:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
repres
 
04:35:55.789 --> 04:35:55.799 align:start position:0%
Damon are there other State University
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
systems that are doing something like
 
04:36:01.709 --> 04:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
this uh I'm not sure there are
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
organizations like the national Clearing
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
House which
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
we we get information from them in terms
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
of uh six-year degree four-year degree
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I I'm sure that we have Mr Cronin is
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
also going to speak he he could convey
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
some of that to us because they are a
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
clearing house for this type of
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.390 --> 04:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
excellent the national Clearing
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
House yeah yeah we we had a debate on
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
that down in Senate Ed one day I can't
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
remember uh when that was maybe 3 years
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
ago and where we pay dues to
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
it yeah yeah
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you for taking my question
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm uh this applies to
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
all higher education institutions public
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
and private is that the intent of the
 
04:37:05.470 --> 04:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
bill it applies to all nonprofit
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
education okay any further
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions and the private stuff is
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
available if you look at the sheet I
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
just passed out earlier you can see what
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
the price of attendance uh average price
 
04:37:29.789 --> 04:37:29.799 align:start position:0%
is for SE anoms for Dartmouth for
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce uh kobby Sawyer that
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
information is all available through the
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
Clearing House and so um there there
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
some of this data is available um but I
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't know to what degree sure and I
 
04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
think the big the big point was to try
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
to make it more granular on a degree
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
specific basis what their what the job
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
prospects are how long it's going to
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
take to pay back your loans things like
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
that yeah and we have research too that
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
been on
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
restructuring where we know that 2third
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
of the land grant student population in
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
some of these colleges are attending 12
 
04:38:12.189 --> 04:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
specific Majors all those other Majors
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
have the other third and so obviously
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
which is more coste
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
effective further further
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
04:38:23.279 --> 04:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
introducing

04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
Cronin uh good afternoon members of the
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
committee Tom Cronin University system
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so usnh is uh opposed
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
to the legislation as drafted uh
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
certainly some of the questions during
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
the opening testimony got some of our
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
concerns I at the end of the day I'd
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
suggest ultimately the bill would
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
require every institution of highed in
 
04:38:55.629 --> 04:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
the state to develop lengthy dashboards
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
of Statistics that would be difficult or
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
in some cases simply impossible uh for
 
04:39:02.670 --> 04:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
us to develop and manage and it's also
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly duplicative of efforts that
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
are already Ong goinging at the federal
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
level so second part first the federal
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
government has uh currently the
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
department of education's college scor
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
card uh simply just Google US doe
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
College scorecard and you can pull up
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
every institution of higher ed in the
 
04:39:21.789 --> 04:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
country and scroll through really a
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
number of the statistics that would be
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
required by the legislation uh including
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh but not necessarily limited to uh
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment cost completion rates
 
04:39:34.029 --> 04:39:34.039 align:start position:0%
starting salaries campus diversity uh
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
Etc and they do it in a very consistent
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
accessible format where you can compare
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
any institution to any other uh across
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
the board in addition to what's already
 
04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
there uh literally within the last
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks uh the federal
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
government just finalized new called
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
gainful employment rules um and those
 
04:39:52.270 --> 04:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
rules are going to require institutions
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
to also share data that will allow
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
calculations on debt to earnings and
 
04:39:58.990 --> 04:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
really the financial value premium of
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
higher ed and the way they're able to do
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
this at the federal level that would be
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
very challenging for us is the federal
 
04:40:04.990 --> 04:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
government is able to take the
 
04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
information we report through ipeds
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
which stands for the integrated
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Education data system and
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
cross reference that with tax
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
information uh federal financial aid
 
04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
information and other pieces of data
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
that only the federal government have
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
access to in order to then produce a
 
04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
picture that consumers students and
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
families can look at when making their
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
higher ed choices we simply don't have
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
access to all that information in a way
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we could produce a lot of this data
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
in a incredibly reliable way for example
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
the representative mentioned uh
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
employment rate so we do uh across the
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
university system What's called the
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
first destination survey so we ask all
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
of our students um within the first few
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
months of their graduation how they're
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
doing in order to get a sense from them
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
how they're doing right and so we're
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
proud to say uh you know across usnh
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
like we are about above a 90% success
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
rate is what it's called so either more
 
04:40:56.910 --> 04:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
than 90% of our students are either
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
working or pursuing F their education
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
within six months of graduation we
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly use that in our materials when
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
talking to students but we also wouldn't
 
04:41:07.390 --> 04:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
call it a uh you
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
know it is a a self-reported survey it
 
04:41:13.470 --> 04:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
is not you know completely reliable data
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
that should be put against how anybody
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
else does that survey um in addition to
 
04:41:19.470 --> 04:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
that starting salaries as I mentioned
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
would have to be self-reported would' be
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
incomplete unreliable uh because we
 
04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
don't have access to their tax
 
04:41:26.910 --> 04:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
information uh so really for us those
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
are the the two main concerns is the
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
federal government is already doing and
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
is mandating that we do a lot of this
 
04:41:33.390 --> 04:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction with Federal Data
 
04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
Systems and the stuff that sort of left
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
is left for a reason because it'd be
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
very challenging to develop it in a
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
reliable format happy to take questions
 
04:41:43.590 --> 04:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh Mr
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
Cronin yes represent
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
leus would there be any reason why you
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to just take that data
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
from the federal website and put it on
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
your website so that a student or a
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
parent who was just going through
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
looking at your website as opposed to
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
where is this information on a federal
 
04:42:12.270 --> 04:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
website be able to just look at it sure
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
I would there be any reason no um I
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
think we do and I will say if you were
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
to poke through any of our websites you
 
04:42:19.708 --> 04:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
will find a lot of information on
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
enrollment um I think we're proud of
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
most of the data that's up in the the
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
federal system and we do use it when
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
talking to prospective students and
 
04:42:29.550 --> 04:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
families for sure okay y thank you but I
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary that we
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
duplicate that effort or mandate that we
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
duplicate that effort further for the
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:39.718 --> 04:42:41.910 align:start position:0%

this committee regarding hb1
 
04:43:31.948 --> 04:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
1436 uh relative to requiring
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
institutions of HED to maintain certain
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
statistical information on their website
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
I'm Debbie skiri and I serve as the
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
president of New Hampshire College
 
04:43:43.948 --> 04:43:43.958 align:start position:0%
University Council and we respectfully
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
request that you oppose this legislation
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
the NHC um as many of you know is a
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Consortium of public and
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
private institutions of higher education
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
in our state and these institutions are
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
recognized and highly regarded for their
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding teaching research and
 
04:44:01.788 --> 04:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
community service activities they serve
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
as major centers of activity and they
 
04:44:06.750 --> 04:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
vital to the economic development of the
 
04:44:09.628 --> 04:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
community in our state um New Hampshire
 
04:44:11.230 --> 04:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
College University member colleges and
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
universities are deeply concerned about
 
04:44:15.628 --> 04:44:15.638 align:start position:0%
college costs student debt and the
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
extent that our students are
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
prepared to find their way in our
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
state's economy our institutions are
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
committed to working with students and
 
04:44:27.390 --> 04:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
parents to help them identify the best
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
institutional fit for their college
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
education transparency and openness
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
around College pricing is critical
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
as well as is alerting students to
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
programs that could potentially leave
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
them in debt we appreciate the sentiment
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
behind 1436 to ensure students and
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
parents have important information about
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
college costs however we are concerned
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
that hb1 1436 is duplicative of nearly
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
identif identical Federal Regulation by
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Education scheduled
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
to go into effect as early as July the
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
1st 2024 of this year and therefore
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
costs this regulation is known as the
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
financial value transparency framework
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
it's mouthful um this regulation will
 
04:45:17.948 --> 04:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
cover all programs that participate in
 
04:45:19.470 --> 04:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
title four which is also known as
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
federal student aid financial aid and it
 
04:45:24.910 --> 04:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
will include the following statistics so
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
debt to ear sorry debt to earnings
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
measures that reflect the affordability
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
of loan payments for graduates and
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
earnings premium measure that evaluates
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
whether program graduates are likely to
 
04:45:40.150 --> 04:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
be able to earn more than a typical high
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
school graduate the published length of
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
each program the total costs of tuition
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
fees books supplies and equipment
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
students likely earnings after
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
graduation and also the median student
 
04:45:55.470 --> 04:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
loan debt the published timeline
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
indicates that institutions of high Ed
 
04:45:59.708 --> 04:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
will be required to start reporting July
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
31st again of this year and these data
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
points will be released as early as
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
2025 um the goal of this the financial
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
value transparency framework is to
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
empower students and their families to
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
make informed Apples to Apples decisions
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
among all colleges and universities
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
across our nation so the idea is that
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
there would be one spot where people
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
could sort of like look right straight
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
across and compare program by program on
 
04:46:28.590 --> 04:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
all of these different
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
metrics passing 1436 would further
 
04:46:33.628 --> 04:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
increase College costs as institutions
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
would need to hire staff to monitor
 
04:46:37.868 --> 04:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
their website um given what's already
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
been pointed out the really harsh
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
penalties proposed in this spell
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
including loss of nonprofit status and
 
04:46:45.390 --> 04:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
the right to bring private action
 
04:46:47.310 --> 04:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
against the colleges and universities
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
again thank you so much for this
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about transparency
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
and cost and I'm happy to try to answer
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
any questions and also at the bottom
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the source which is
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually is also coming for the Federal
 
04:47:00.190 --> 04:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
Register which really outlines a lot in
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
a lot more detail what they have planned
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
on the horizon Thank you very thank you
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
leus I just want to make sure I
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
understand that the federal program is
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
going to be based on the actual course
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
of study major whatever so that they can
 
04:47:19.878 --> 04:47:21.390 align:start position:0%
of study major whatever so that they can
compare

04:47:21.390 --> 04:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
compare
 
04:47:24.310 --> 04:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
um one course of study to another course
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
of study to make a good decision that
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
way is that correct that is correct I
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
believe it is going to be um organized
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
on what they call a sip code CIP um
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
which groups programs that are very
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
similar together thank you you're very
 
04:47:43.470 --> 04:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
welcome yes represent
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question with this sort of a
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
provision also
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
include inducements by colleges and
 
04:47:58.590 --> 04:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
universities to by lower tuition for
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
example uh to participate in certain
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
programs so that if you were going to
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
enroll in this program you would get a
 
04:48:07.590 --> 04:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
lower tuition or in another program
 
04:48:09.788 --> 04:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
you'd have to P the regular tuition
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
something to that effect I think you
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
know it's still um in its infancy um I
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
think the goal was really to get at that
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
openness and transparency to put the
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
information out there and that it really
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
would be the goal would really just be
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
to serve uh families and students
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
regarding exact costs as they as they
 
04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:36.440 --> 04:48:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions when you're publishing
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
information relating to let's say
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
tuition costs yes at a school and we
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
know that the tuition cost you read for
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
example like for UNH may be here but the
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
actual cost may be down here as a result
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
of grant program Grant programming which
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
is offered to students which one is
 
04:49:06.510 --> 04:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
published so that so that we can get an
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
actual you know for if you're in this
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
income bracket your tuition may be
 
04:49:14.110 --> 04:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced I would imagine
 
04:49:16.830 --> 04:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
because it is based on a a website that
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
they would have to be created in a way
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
that would sort of fit the most number
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
of people in order to have it be useful
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about an individual
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
student I think that would be very in
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
their circumstances their income and you
 
04:49:32.230 --> 04:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
know all the things that you're alluding
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
to I think it would be kind of hard to
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
be able to print that out is on a
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
website so I would guess it would be
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
probably the average tuition I really
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
don't know it may be um printed uh
 
04:49:45.788 --> 04:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
within the context of the of the
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
document we could check that out and see
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh Kathy prenter do you have any
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
comments on this particular topic is
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you've been the treasurer of the state
 
04:49:55.390 --> 04:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
and now you're
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
Chancellor not oh
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
well my name is centure I serve as the
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
chief administrative officer of
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
University system two quick
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
comments there's no fiscal note because
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
the university system and Community
 
04:50:13.390 --> 04:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
College system were not provided the
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill to to um write a fiscal note and
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
number two the college scorecard does
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
provide net average tuition so it would
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
be net of financial aid but it's it's a
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's a big average and that um
 
04:50:34.030 --> 04:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
information is generated from iPads m Mr
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
Cronin referred to earlier the I'm not
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to remember
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
the all the words in the acronym but
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's a database of um information that
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
is gathered from colleges across the
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
country by the federal government in
 
04:50:52.110 --> 04:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
tuition financial
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
aid room board books fees all of that
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
and so it boils it down after financial
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
aid to an average cost of attendance for
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
countries uh schools Ross
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
country thank you very much are there
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
you are there any others who would like
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
to speak on this
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill not seeing we'll close close the
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill the
 
04:51:26.670 --> 04:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
hearing 1436 done uh the next bill which
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
we have is HB
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
1690 relative to hiring promotion
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
here oh yeah we're got ahead of
 
04:51:49.760 --> 04:51:52.190 align:start position:0%
here oh yeah we're got ahead of
ourselves

04:51:52.190 --> 04:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
wow and you're going to be headed out
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
time to switch
 
04:52:00.190 --> 04:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
Yeah okay
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
Margaret yeah
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
switch thank you very much you stayed
 
04:52:09.860 --> 04:52:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.870 --> 04:52:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.638 --> 05:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
beler that was
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
strange um yeah I'm not an author of
 
05:02:53.708 --> 05:02:53.718 align:start position:0%
this however I do have some
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
understanding of the the policy position
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
that it's looking to take though the
 
05:02:58.590 --> 05:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
technical details I might not be
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
particularly well versed in um so this
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
is core a an anti-discrimination Bill
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
and much like the last bill I introduced
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
it jumps significantly off of us of this
 
05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
recent Supreme Court ruling that came
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
down um against Harvard University's
 
05:03:19.310 --> 05:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
admission uh position now we saw in the
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
aftermath of that Supreme Court ruling
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
which prohibited using um different
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
metrics based on different mutable
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
characteristics to give preferential
 
05:03:32.830 --> 05:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
treatment to any uh group of persons
 
05:03:36.430 --> 05:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
that though um colleges began moving
 
05:03:41.788 --> 05:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
away from the explicit and obvious um
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination that was being used as
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted we saw some colleges come
 
05:03:50.190 --> 05:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
out um and openly say that what they
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
would essentially do is since they could
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
no longer utilize test scores and break
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
out things like that as a way to
 
05:04:00.270 --> 05:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate what they would do is they
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
would simply solicit information in
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
means and some of those other means
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
include uh uh either self-reported or
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
the solicitation of what is so-called
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
statements which are in this context
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
seeking to
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
assertain specific information about the
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
applicant um in terms of gender or
 
05:04:28.910 --> 05:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
race whereby subjective measures can be
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
applied to a statement rather than
 
05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
objective measures um such as test
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
scores and what that amounts to is is a
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
way of conducting the same sort of
 
05:04:41.948 --> 05:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination which was ideologically
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
motivated um that was struck down by the
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and burying it in a way
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
that makes it harder to harder to locate
 
05:04:53.708 --> 05:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
um and in that same vein uh these the
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of these sorts of statements
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
which are essentially um ideological
 
05:05:01.628 --> 05:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
statements of Faith are something that
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
should be prohibited in general um so be
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
Happ to answer any questions on on that
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
line again the technical aspects I
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
probably can't help with on this bill
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
but okay are
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
you like to ask that you both can come
 
05:05:32.350 --> 05:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
up together if you want to Nadine Petty
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
and and Dy Morris uh nen you're from
 
05:05:41.470 --> 05:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
UNH and and Dy you're from K uh keing
 
05:05:41.480 --> 05:05:48.110 align:start position:0%
UNH and and Dy you're from K uh keing
State

05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
welcome right is it on yeah you're good
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone um so again my name
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
is Nan Petty I'm the chief diversity
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
officer from the University of New
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here this afternoon to
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
offer testimony in opposition to HB 1690
 
05:06:07.708 --> 05:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
there are three main reasons for this
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
opposition and I would respectfully
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
request that this group also hold
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to that first HB 1690 is
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
redundant which makes it fully
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the usnh already adheres to
 
05:06:25.230 --> 05:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
both state and federal anti-is
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws and has been in
 
05:06:29.708 --> 05:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
compliance with these laws since
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
2012 in all aspects of hiring promotion
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
graduation and admission practices as it
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
specifically relates to hiring and the
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
use of diversity statements within
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
application materials um at UNH
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
specifically there are checks and
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
balances in place during various stages
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
of hiring to ensure that candidates meet
 
05:06:53.310 --> 05:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
stated qualifications of job
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
descriptions something to note is that
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
information about the race ethnicity
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
gender disability status and other
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
protected identities of individual
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
applicants is withheld during search
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
committee deliberation processes to
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
ensure a fair and unbiased or as fair
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
and as unbiased to search outcome as
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
possible and I do want to correct
 
05:07:18.030 --> 05:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
something that was um stated during the
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill diversity
 
05:07:23.230 --> 05:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
statements do not ask any applicant for
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
their race for their gender for any kind
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
information applicants and the hiring
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
process are not required to include
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
information about their protected
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
identities in in diversity statements
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
the statements instead are used to
 
05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
assess the ways that applicants are
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
prepared to engage in respectful and
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
productive interactions with students
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
and with colleagues regardless of
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
identities second HB 1690 is unclear and
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
it leaves room for interpretation and
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding as it relates to What A
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
diversity statement is and how such
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
statements are utilized within
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
usnh it is also unclear if the proposed
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition is addressing both written
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
statements and or verbal statements and
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
to what extent questions about diversity
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
and inclusion and usn's commitment to
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
these values or statements about
 
05:08:24.910 --> 05:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
personal commitments to De are sometimes
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
initiated by applicants without
 
05:08:29.788 --> 05:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
solicitation so it is also unclear if
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is proposing law to censor
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
incre queries or statements an applicant
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
might make of their own
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
valtion thirdly the proposal for private
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
citizens to bring legal action against
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire institution who might
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
utilize diversity statements is
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
troubling giv the vagueness of the bill
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
itself there is a lack of understanding
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
of how diversity statements are used and
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
the Bill's lack of clarity will
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
inevitably subject usnh to expensive and
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
regular frivolous litigation that could
 
05:09:04.750 --> 05:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
affect educational access for thousands
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
of students attending public
 
05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
institutions across the
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
Dy uh good afternoon um as mentioned
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
before my name is dy moris and I'm the
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
associate vice president uh for
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
institutional equity and diversity at
 
05:09:26.310 --> 05:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
keing State I've had the honor to serve
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
so many young adults uh since 2008 in
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
this position um so I've had
 
05:09:34.670 --> 05:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with hundreds if not
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of young people in the state
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire about uh this issue uh
 
05:09:42.390 --> 05:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
I too would like to support my colleague
 
05:09:45.390 --> 05:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
in opposing uh this particular bill and
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
the main reason is academic Excellence
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh these types of statements uh allow
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
for us to draw in more people to have
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
broader perspectives so the statements
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we are would ask of an applicant is
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
around perspective around how would they
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
provide an education that touches the
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
majority of students if not all students
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
so it's making them think in in an
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
intentional way about how do you best
 
05:10:17.868 --> 05:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
provide a service for students and all
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
of my years of working with students as
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
I say I've been in this position since
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
20 2008 but I've been in higher ed uh
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
much longer than that I started when I
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
was 12 but this whole idea of of looking
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
at and hearing stories around young
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
people talking about what was so helpful
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
to challenge their own perspective the
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
way that they thought about things and
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
this is what these diversity statements
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
to get an idea of how people are
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
thinking about this who will be mentors
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
and will be supporters of young people
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
as they develop into the citizens that
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
we need not only in the state of New
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but in the United States and I
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
think by creating more and more
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
roadblocks to people being able to have
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
those discussions it doesn't allow for
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
us to give the best possible opportunity
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
to the young people in this state to be
 
05:11:14.548 --> 05:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
very competitive outside of this state
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
and also to help this state grow and
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
mature as we know it can do so part of
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
the reason that these statements are
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
important part of the reason we have
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
statements of commitment for diversity
 
05:11:29.150 --> 05:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
is because it's not just for a small
 
05:11:31.390 --> 05:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
group of people it's for all students
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
and if we we could interview students uh
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
and find out they will definitely tell
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
you that they were challenged and in
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
that challenge they were able to create
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
more innovative solutions uh than they
 
05:11:45.390 --> 05:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
would have with just having a singular
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
way of thinking about something and we
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
all know that there are some complex
 
05:11:51.750 --> 05:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
issues we're dealing with and it'll take
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
multiple perspectives in order to um be
 
05:11:57.670 --> 05:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
able to successfully navigate uh the
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
troubles that we have so for that reason
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
I would would ask for you to oppose uh a
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
statement that has not been used to
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
narrow the pool of people as a matter of
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
fact it's it's used to broaden it's used
 
05:12:14.548 --> 05:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
to create an opportunity to have a rich
 
05:12:17.070 --> 05:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
conversation within classrooms and to
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
allow for people on campus to feel like
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
they belong and they can be active and
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
engaged citizens of the United States of
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
America so I really do because of
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and all the other
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
things that we hope to have a strong
 
05:12:34.990 --> 05:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
community and connection between
 
05:12:37.230 --> 05:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
individuals from diverse backgrounds
 
05:12:40.830 --> 05:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
that you oppose this thank you are there
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
05:12:48.150 --> 05:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
you both for being here um I Heard a
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about what was not on the
 
05:12:50.520 --> 05:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
little bit about what was not on the
diversity

05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
statements um and a little bit about
 
05:12:57.788 --> 05:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
what um you hope to accomplish with the
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
diversity statement could you tell us a
 
05:13:01.788 --> 05:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
little bit about what is on the
 
05:13:03.868 --> 05:13:03.878 align:start position:0%
diversity statement and and it's I think
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
it's quite important as this bill is
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
calling for um elimination of funding
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
for you if you have diversity statements
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll go ahead and answer that
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
one so there is not a
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
specific statement in a diversity
 
05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
statement so the search committees have
 
05:13:23.548 --> 05:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
the right because we use them for not
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
even for all searches for some searches
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
for some positions we use them um
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
specifically to talk to what is going to
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
be be expected for the actual role that
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're hiring for so some examples
 
05:13:38.190 --> 05:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
of some diversity prompts that have been
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
used in the past for example might be a
 
05:13:44.190 --> 05:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
question that says tell us about how you
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
have um Incorporated inclusivity in your
 
05:13:48.320 --> 05:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
have um Incorporated inclusivity in your
field

05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
field
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
research okay and that's one example or
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
tell us how you have considered
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
disability in your teaching
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
pedagogy that's another example those
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
are examples of diversity statements
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
that have been used at the University of
 
05:14:02.520 --> 05:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
that have been used at the University of
New

05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you represent
 
05:14:10.110 --> 05:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
mil thank you for being here and thank
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question what has the
 
05:14:15.868 --> 05:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
impact of the Supreme Court decision had
 
05:14:19.868 --> 05:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
on your work and how has it differ
 
05:14:22.510 --> 05:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
differed as a result of that decision
 
05:14:23.830 --> 05:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank are you referring to the
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
affirmative action yes yeah so it it
 
05:14:28.510 --> 05:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't impacted us at all because we've
 
05:14:31.390 --> 05:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
been following that rule for quite some
 
05:14:33.310 --> 05:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
time so nothing changed I mean
 
05:14:34.830 --> 05:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
essentially what we did is we went back
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we were
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
continuing to follow those policies we
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
just sort of did a double check on our
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
practices and on our policies um just to
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
sh up anything that might have been a
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
loose end but like I said we've been
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
following anti-discrimination laws um
 
05:14:51.150 --> 05:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
for quite some time and so there was no
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
impact to us
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from the
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee I got one regarding Kean yes
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
um you have the C Co Center over there
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
which is an excellent Center dealing
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
with the Holocaust yes and your program
 
05:15:10.270 --> 05:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
deals with diversity and acceptance of
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
differing positions and
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
thinking um how how is that occurring
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
over Keen right now are people all
 
05:15:19.548 --> 05:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
accepting people that may be Jewish or
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
maybe Muslim or maybe Presbyterian and
 
05:15:25.390 --> 05:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
without right um this other stuff that's
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
going on in our country yeah as with
 
05:15:29.788 --> 05:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
with all human behavior it's complicated
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
and so what we are providing
 
05:15:34.350 --> 05:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
are opportunities for people to have
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
those conversations and not just a
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
surface level conversation but the type
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
of conversation that attends to the
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
nuances and the complexities involved in
 
05:15:46.510 --> 05:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
all of this and so in our efforts to do
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that uh we make it very clear around
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
expectations of interacting with one
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
another uh we don't silence anyone in
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
that in that I idea of having those
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
conversations and it is being led by the
 
05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
coin Center and a couple other uh
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
organizations on campus we've had
 
05:16:05.948 --> 05:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
several conversations and I felt like
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
they were very productive conversations
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
on campus over the past few uh months
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for coming
 
05:16:19.948 --> 05:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
Reed these were his
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
introduced CES good afternoon I'm
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed representing the community
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
college system of New
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we respectfully oppose this
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
bill and I would I would Echo some of
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
what you've heard before the community
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
college system is subject to existing
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
state and federal
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and we take
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
adherence to these principles and these
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
laws very seriously U however there's
 
05:16:55.230 --> 05:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
there's significant uncertainty in some
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the language of house 1690 and the
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
severe penalties for non-compliance are
 
05:17:02.830 --> 05:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
of great concern um I go to specifics
 
05:17:05.910 --> 05:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll give a few examples in the bill
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
so for example in the hiring environment
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
a candidate for a position might wish to
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
highlight something in their background
 
05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates experience supporting
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
diversity and Equity initiatives would
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
receiving such a statement place the
 
05:17:20.788 --> 05:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
institution at risk for non-compliance
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
with this bill since the word that's
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
used is permitting um an institution
 
05:17:27.150 --> 05:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
can't permit diversity equity and
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
inclusion statements what exactly does
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
that mean in the um in the hiring
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
environment it's also unclear how
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
broadly this language would be construed
 
05:17:39.548 --> 05:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
Beyond um hiring for example within
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
institutional strategic plans that
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
address a commitment to equity to
 
05:17:46.750 --> 05:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
diversity Andor to inclusion with
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
respect to the populations that we
 
05:17:49.350 --> 05:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
strive to
 
05:17:53.070 --> 05:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
serve um further language on page page
 
05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
one line 26 talks about nothing in this
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
section shall be interpreted as
 
05:18:01.110 --> 05:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting Bonafide qualifications
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
based Bas on sex which are reasonably
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to the normal operation of
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
public employment Etc we're not sure
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
what that language is is intended to
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
allow and we'd appreciate if the sponsor
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
might be able to provide some
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
clarification of that um the language
 
05:18:18.150 --> 05:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
that authorizes any citizen to bring
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
suit against to college is is either
 
05:18:22.750 --> 05:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguous or very Broad and could be
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
interpreted to allow a wide spectrum of
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
people to bring a lawsuit potential
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
Awards could include court cost and
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees which could create an
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
incentive for new Suites that could
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
become draining of both institutional
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
time and legal
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
resources um let's see for the lawyers
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
in the room the evidentiary standard in
 
05:18:43.628 --> 05:18:43.638 align:start position:0%
the bill is atypical for civil actions
 
05:18:45.230 --> 05:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
and puts the college at a legal
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
disadvantage once a plan if makes a
 
05:18:49.548 --> 05:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
prasy case against the college the
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
burden shifts to the college prove to
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
prove it has not violated a statute and
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
the college must do so via an
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
evidentiary standard of clear and
 
05:18:59.868 --> 05:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence civil cases usually
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a preponderance of the evidence
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
standard so the standard in this chapter
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
is more difficult to meet than in a
 
05:19:08.590 --> 05:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
typical civil case also the college is
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
being asked to prove a negative that it
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
did not violate the statute we also have
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
major concerns with the language that
 
05:19:16.628 --> 05:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
sets out the institution's liability and
 
05:19:18.548 --> 05:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
financial exposure while we would
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
attempt in good faith to comply with the
 
05:19:22.230 --> 05:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
state law duly enacted if the
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
institutions found to be in violation of
 
05:19:23.958 --> 05:19:24.708 align:start position:0%
institutions found to be in violation of
this

05:19:24.708 --> 05:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:19:27.270 --> 05:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
chapter and the full penalties contained
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
therein and forced we would be required
 
05:19:30.910 --> 05:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
to Forfeit the entire amount of State
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
funding we would otherwise receive in a
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
given year rendering the organization
 
05:19:37.070 --> 05:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
unable to operate and unable to meet its
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
commitment to
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
students I would point out also that the
 
05:19:42.750 --> 05:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
community colleges are open access
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
institutions meaning um we don't make
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
the kinds of admissions decisions that
 
05:19:51.150 --> 05:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
might um you know where certain
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
demographic information might come into
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
play as is the case potentially with
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
other institutions and when we talk
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
about diversity equity and inclusion at
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
ccsnh we talk about being places where
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
anyone can Thrive as a student as an
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
employer as as an employee I mean um our
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
Chancellor likes to say that New
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire given its labor force
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
challenges and um wanting to be to
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
retain a high quality of life in this
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
state and high levels of Civic
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
engagement we cannot afford to leave
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
Talent on the bench which means we need
 
05:20:22.750 --> 05:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
to create opportunities for all New
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents um which means
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
paying attention to what we can do to be
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
those places where anyone can Thrive um
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll stop there because I don't
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to be too repetitive of what's been
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
said I'm happy to take any any questions
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
but we would ask you to consider iing
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you any questions of the
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
community college
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
system so what would happen to the
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
community college system if you made a
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
mistake here and you would lose all your
 
05:20:49.310 --> 05:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
revenue from the
 
05:20:51.628 --> 05:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
state that's my reading of the bill and
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
at this point we're about 50% funded
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
Yeah by state appropriation
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
yeah big
 
05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
yeah big
dollars

05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
 
05:21:08.548 --> 05:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
much are there any other folks want to
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
talk uh on this particular bill in the
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
audience not seeing any we will close
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
this hearing on 1690 and enter the last
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
one for the day 3:00 to start so pardon
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
me it's a 3 o' to start so plus we
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
on I don't know if there's anyone here
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
to test can't we declare our El in a
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
different time zone yeah it's 5:00
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere do we have it's 5:00 somewhere
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
yes do we have cards for this bill no no
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
which one is this is uh
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.190 --> 05:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
this obviously people are not looking at
 
05:22:02.200 --> 05:22:04.190 align:start position:0%
this obviously people are not looking at
the

05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
calendar and are we still getting uh
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
emails for notice of
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%

it it used to be if a person didn't show

legislation and it is a pleasure to be
 
05:42:19.830 --> 05:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
here to introduce to you my triple win
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
policy this idea developed out of a
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
homework project and some encouragement
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
from students I met at the US Senate
 
05:42:28.270 --> 05:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
youth program in March I'm grateful to
 
05:42:29.910 --> 05:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leno and representative
 
05:42:31.468 --> 05:42:31.478 align:start position:0%
Schultz for their energy and
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
encouragement they have been great
 
05:42:36.390 --> 05:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
mentors the national media has brought
 
05:42:38.310 --> 05:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
significant attention to the prevailing
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
student loan crisis which has generated
 
05:42:43.230 --> 05:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
Divergent viewpoints regarding potential
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
remedies as of 2023 and overwhelmingly
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
93% of students bear some form of
 
05:42:52.708 --> 05:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
student loan debt collectively amounting
 
05:42:54.990 --> 05:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
to 1.6
 
05:42:57.548 --> 05:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
trillion this predicament pervades every
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
corner of our nation and including our
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
own State of New
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire President Biden employed an
 
05:43:06.468 --> 05:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
executive order providing $1 to $20,000
 
05:43:09.150 --> 05:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
in attempt to alleviate this issue but
 
05:43:10.750 --> 05:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
it was ruled
 
05:43:12.430 --> 05:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Democrats and
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans also differ in their views
 
05:43:17.230 --> 05:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
on this issue to find a middle ground
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
and offer a solution that appeases both
 
05:43:21.430 --> 05:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
political parties I wanted to introduce
 
05:43:23.310 --> 05:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
specific legislation pertaining to the
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this proposal aims to
 
05:43:29.548 --> 05:43:29.558 align:start position:0%
Institute a unique option for tuition
 
05:43:32.110 --> 05:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
credit to alleviate future student loan
 
05:43:35.430 --> 05:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
debt within our state this bill proposes
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire credits
 
05:43:40.910 --> 05:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
$2,500 a year if a student volunteers a
 
05:43:43.868 --> 05:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
100 hours in one calendar year at state
 
05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
approved sites such as nursing homes
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
food banks or homeless
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
shelters this opportunity would be
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
available to all high school and college
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
students attending a public institution
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or from New Hampshire
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
this offer would be renewable for up to
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
8 years totaling a possibility of
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
$20,000 in tuition
 
05:44:07.510 --> 05:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
credit I think that this bill would
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
benefit the students the community and
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
the state I appreciate your time in
 
05:44:14.468 --> 05:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
listening to this proposal and I'm
 
05:44:16.110 --> 05:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
hopeful that New Hampshire could serve
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
as a pilot for this program and help be
 
05:44:21.390 --> 05:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
a leader on the student debt crisis
 
05:44:24.190 --> 05:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would like to add
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I should have also mentioned I also
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
attended Catholic school where I grew up
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
and service is a huge component of a
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
Catholic Education which I'm proud to
 
05:44:36.990 --> 05:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
have had and to be able to think of this
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
as sort of instead of taking out student
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
loans if you need to this would give
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
students who've already been
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
contributing to the community to pay for
 
05:44:50.430 --> 05:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
college in a way that would be I think
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
fair and representative of the service
 
05:44:56.230 --> 05:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of young people such as Miss
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
Casey um want to do for the state New
 
05:45:01.390 --> 05:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it really is of great
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and I'm honored to be the
 
05:45:06.628 --> 05:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor can I and if we have any
 
05:45:08.590 --> 05:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
questions we're willing to take them
 
05:45:10.270 --> 05:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any questions
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
05:45:13.948 --> 05:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:45:16.830 --> 05:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
you to both of you for presenting this
 
05:45:21.548 --> 05:45:21.558 align:start position:0%
um my question is you have in line 16 um
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be an an approved
 
05:45:23.600 --> 05:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
that it would be an an approved
volunteer

05:45:25.270 --> 05:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
site who who is doing the approving and
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
who's going to validate the number of
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
hours so I take that if you want okay
 
05:45:40.110 --> 05:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
sure um we would be um open to your
 
05:45:42.350 --> 05:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
feedback on this but essentially the
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
creation of the program would lay out
 
05:45:48.430 --> 05:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
the administration of it so um the
 
05:45:51.788 --> 05:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
administrators of the program so this
 
05:45:54.270 --> 05:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
would be um if you want you already were
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
talking about approved sites so um I was
 
05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
also thinking that this could be part of
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
a Department of Education role um in a
 
05:46:06.390 --> 05:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
similar way that for mandated community
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
service um those have been approved
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
activities or organizations we could
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
follow a similar sort of system in which
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed would create state
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
approved volunteer sites and then follow
 
05:46:22.830 --> 05:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
a kind of record system like the um
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
prison or mandatory community service
 
05:46:27.390 --> 05:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
uses so that's kind of managed at a
 
05:46:29.708 --> 05:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
state level and then and if
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
organizations not initially um approved
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
by the department of Ed maybe in the
 
05:46:39.110 --> 05:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
future they could apply to be a state
 
05:46:41.070 --> 05:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
approved volunteer site if they were a
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
commun if they were an organization in
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
need followup followup chch um is there
 
05:46:50.190 --> 05:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
any reason why it wouldn't go through
 
05:46:53.350 --> 05:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
your local school district as the
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
approving um we're open to that idea it
 
05:47:01.750 --> 05:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
just makes it local local control
 
05:47:04.468 --> 05:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative penell and
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
then representative Damon thank you Mr
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much for coming
 
05:47:12.390 --> 05:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
in proposing this legislation and for
 
05:47:15.070 --> 05:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell me how
 
05:47:15.080 --> 05:47:16.350 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell me how
much

05:47:16.350 --> 05:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
um a high school student would make if
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
they were employed sure so I um actually
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
worked at a sandwich shop downtown um
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
the in the past summer and I I was
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
making about $155 or $16 an hour um my
 
05:47:35.670 --> 05:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
friends who are currently employed make
 
05:47:38.670 --> 05:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
between 12 and I would say $16 an hour
 
05:47:42.510 --> 05:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
working and so part some of the um ways
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we came up with the
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
$2,500 for 100 hours of service is that
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
we want to make the offer appealing if
 
05:47:55.390 --> 05:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
students are able to work and make more
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
and earn more money to possibly pay for
 
05:47:59.788 --> 05:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
tuition than this program was offer it
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
would kind of lose that appeal so we
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the students
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
time was being valued and that they were
 
05:48:08.910 --> 05:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
being compensated fairly for that
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer time they were putting into
 
05:48:10.320 --> 05:48:12.230 align:start position:0%
volunteer time they were putting into
these

05:48:12.230 --> 05:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:48:13.948 --> 05:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
organizations thank you very much
 
05:48:16.150 --> 05:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
excellent answer represent
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question and proposing this
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
really I think impressive approach I'm
 
05:48:28.190 --> 05:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would be comfortable
 
05:48:30.910 --> 05:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that specifies that
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
the um organization that the student is
 
05:48:39.270 --> 05:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I'm sure we would be but I I
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to exempt potential
 
05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
service to government entities were
 
05:48:50.548 --> 05:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate so as long as uh because
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's technically not a nonprofit um I
 
05:48:57.230 --> 05:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
think that was our goal was to look at
 
05:49:01.390 --> 05:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
where are there needs and um government
 
05:49:04.750 --> 05:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
type assistance um when I did my junior
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
service in high school I said can I
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer from my congressman you know
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
so things like that should also be
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
available if someone wanted to uh read
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
to or work on literacy at the prison if
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
allowed you know programs like that
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um be off the table do you
 
05:49:23.910 --> 05:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
want to clarify I'm not personally
 
05:49:25.948 --> 05:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
familiar with what that organiz or what
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
that title is would you mind clarifying
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
for me please it's a federal filing that
 
05:49:33.868 --> 05:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
many nonprofits do that basically
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
credentials that they are a nonprofit
 
05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
organization is that an output
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.910 --> 05:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
in we're it's it's a taxation issue okay
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's yeah gives Credence to being a
 
05:49:48.240 --> 05:49:50.990 align:start position:0%
yeah it's yeah gives Credence to being a
nonprofit

05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay further further questions from the
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
05:49:57.628 --> 05:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill in for answering
 
05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
05:50:04.830 --> 05:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
um my question is um so if we're
 
05:50:06.468 --> 05:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
volunteering and we're being compensated
 
05:50:08.468 --> 05:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
at a rate of up to $25 an hour for that
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
doer work and that is taxpayer money
 
05:50:14.350 --> 05:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's being utilized that is in in
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
essence being earned through this labor
 
05:50:21.468 --> 05:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
that's being done um I'm curious on line
 
05:50:24.750 --> 05:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
21 why it would specifically restrict it
 
05:50:27.150 --> 05:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
from being used in private colleges it
 
05:50:31.150 --> 05:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
institutions well I think that is an
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
interesting point that we could consider
 
05:50:39.070 --> 05:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
um you made the point about taxpayer
 
05:50:41.468 --> 05:50:41.478 align:start position:0%
dollars I will say there are already
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
student loan forgiveness programs
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
available to high-paying workers in
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
various biotech jobs and those don't
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
have any parameters at all um as far I
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
could be wrong correct me if I'm wrong
 
05:50:56.110 --> 05:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
someone here probably does know that but
 
05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure they don't have any
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
parameters for Inc come uh or first you
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
know any other sort of issue around that
 
05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
um as long as they're here in New
 
05:51:09.628 --> 05:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jobs um th that forgiveness is
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
paid for by the taxpayer as well so this
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
would I will defer the other part of the
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
question about why not private colleges
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
Casey um in a
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
simp we initially said Public Schools
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
um public school students and public
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
universities just because I was thinking
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
um for example I I'm going to a private
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
Catholic school right now and service is
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
something that's a mandatory part of my
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
it's one of the pillars of the school
 
05:51:52.868 --> 05:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
service and education and so we wanted
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
to really make that opportunity
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
available to public school students and
 
05:52:01.708 --> 05:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
typically um the public
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
universities have um lower tuition costs
 
05:52:07.628 --> 05:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
than some of these private institutions
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so making that more affordable um
 
05:52:13.708 --> 05:52:13.718 align:start position:0%
for example I think the UNH the average
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
UNH in state tuition is about
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
$30,000 and this um proposal could
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
significantly cut into that where some
 
05:52:25.230 --> 05:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the private um institutions with $60
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
plus thousand tuition it might not Mak
 
05:52:30.030 --> 05:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
as much of an impact but I'm not we're
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
not opposed to including private
 
05:52:32.000 --> 05:52:35.230 align:start position:0%
not opposed to including private
universities

05:52:35.230 --> 05:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.110 --> 05:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
also yes representative Woodcock thank
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
chair M Casey thank you so much for
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this I appreciate that and
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're your work um my my question
 
05:52:49.350 --> 05:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
follows up a little bit on repres
 
05:52:51.868 --> 05:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
belches so is your am I understanding
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
this right there actually wouldn't be a
 
05:52:56.670 --> 05:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
CRA a cash transaction if if the way you
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
have it apparently structured
 
05:53:00.948 --> 05:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
the state institution would see say a
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
credit or a reduction in your tuition
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill that you get and there just be a
 
05:53:08.310 --> 05:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
credit so the the state school wouldn't
 
05:53:09.990 --> 05:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
get 2
 
05:53:13.230 --> 05:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
$2500 um period right there' be a
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
reduction um that's where it come from
 
05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
this the school would reduce that is
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
that your intent that's correct this um
 
05:53:22.830 --> 05:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
proposal the credit so to speak would
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
have no cash value it would just be it
 
05:53:28.510 --> 05:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
would lower that tuition bill okay okay
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
may fall up one more sure thank you
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
um if I uh started in school a say UNH
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
this community college in I started at
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
UNH and I do my first year and I uh
 
05:53:46.948 --> 05:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
decide to trans drop out or transfer to
 
05:53:48.190 --> 05:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh keing
 
05:53:51.390 --> 05:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
State uh can I get back in the program
 
05:53:52.990 --> 05:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
and your understanding or is it just
 
05:53:54.990 --> 05:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
like you was one school I'm thinking
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to follow this
 
05:54:00.030 --> 05:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
around or you're not sure yet I think it
 
05:54:04.030 --> 05:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
would make sense to um allow it to be
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
available to any of our fine public
 
05:54:09.070 --> 05:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
institutions in New Hampshire so I can't
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
think of a reason why I wouldn't
 
05:54:12.468 --> 05:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
continue I mean you we could think of
 
05:54:14.670 --> 05:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
this and could name it a scholarship
 
05:54:18.468 --> 05:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
program maybe that is more at in the
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
concept that we're trying to reach with
 
05:54:23.310 --> 05:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um and it didn't occur to me
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
till this moment the college scholarship
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
um that probably actually is more
 
05:54:31.230 --> 05:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
accurate um you know a public service
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship to go to our public
 
05:54:35.948 --> 05:54:35.958 align:start position:0%
institutions I think makes sense but to
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
um also as a way to keep students here
 
05:54:42.190 --> 05:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
but to get to your question um
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely it should be portable okay
 
05:54:46.510 --> 05:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
that my question thank you Mr chair
 
05:54:48.270 --> 05:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further question
 
05:54:48.280 --> 05:54:49.310 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further question
represent

05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Casey and
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz for uh for
 
05:54:59.230 --> 05:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this in this afternoon um
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if um if you're aware
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
that if a high school student
 
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
began uh volunteering under this program
 
05:55:12.070 --> 05:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
at 100 hours a year beginning their
 
05:55:14.110 --> 05:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
freshman year repeat doing it again
 
05:55:15.468 --> 05:55:15.478 align:start position:0%
sophomore year junior year and Senior
 
05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
year that uh that they would amass
 
05:55:21.750 --> 05:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
enough tuition credit to essentially
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
have um tuition and fees fully paid for
 
05:55:28.350 --> 05:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
um enrollment at a at a two-year
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
Community College and uh earn a valuable
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh two-year degree following
 
05:55:35.600 --> 05:55:37.390 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh two-year degree following
that

05:55:37.390 --> 05:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure yes I think so so and then and a
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair yes and and given the
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
um given the the um uh really the
 
05:55:48.990 --> 05:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
workforce issues that we're we're facing
 
05:55:50.030 --> 05:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I know that's
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
compounded by a lot of other issues too
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
like housing and and transportation and
 
05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
things like that but U but do you see
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
that as a um as a as a
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
positive um because it's not an
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
insignificant investment by the state
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
$25 million a year is what uh is what's
 
05:56:10.350 --> 05:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
estimated in the fiscal note um but
 
05:56:11.708 --> 05:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
given that we're already spending close
 
05:56:14.350 --> 05:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
to $45 million a year on community
 
05:56:16.590 --> 05:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
community college that this would be a
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
good uh a good investment for the state
 
05:56:22.750 --> 05:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you repino for your
 
05:56:25.270 --> 05:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
question and yes I think I definitely
 
05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
see that as a positive benefit one of
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
the the things with this proposal is to
 
05:56:32.468 --> 05:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
not only help students kind of reduce
 
05:56:34.510 --> 05:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
that barrier to entry and be able to get
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
that college education but also when
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing this volunteer service and
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
are in these communities maybe forming
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
relationships to like you said possibly
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
create Career Connections and when we're
 
05:56:51.310 --> 05:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
making um College more accessible and
 
05:56:53.310 --> 05:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
affordable for New Hampshire students
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're likely to stay in state for that
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
school and it's helping our state gain
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
those young professionals that can
 
05:57:01.868 --> 05:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
contribute to the workforce that can
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
help um hopefully like um prevent some
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
of that Workforce shortage and
 
05:57:11.350 --> 05:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately generate economic output for
 
05:57:11.360 --> 05:57:12.590 align:start position:0%
ultimately generate economic output for
our

05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
state thank you are there are there any
 
05:57:15.600 --> 05:57:17.190 align:start position:0%
state thank you are there are there any
further

05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions so for example in my my
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
district Woodsville High School requires
 
05:57:24.830 --> 05:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
community service for
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
graduation um and and they get the
 
05:57:30.190 --> 05:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
credit for that that um would the
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
students then are doing it within the
 
05:57:33.868 --> 05:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
school environment they go out and clean
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
part of the Appalachian Trail they do
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things for community
 
05:57:38.468 --> 05:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
service because that's where we live up
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the mountains um would they receive
 
05:57:45.390 --> 05:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
the credit plus this $2,500 you're
 
05:57:47.468 --> 05:57:47.478 align:start position:0%
talking about if they're taking it
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
through their course at school which is
 
05:57:50.000 --> 05:57:51.150 align:start position:0%
through their course at school which is
community

05:57:51.150 --> 05:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
service so can I just clarify when
 
05:57:55.868 --> 05:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about credit are they
 
05:57:58.030 --> 05:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
receiving academic credit for those
 
05:58:00.788 --> 05:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
hours they're meeting all the academic
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
credits required by the department see
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
we can to graduate in the state you have
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
to have 20 credits some schools maybe I
 
05:58:09.070 --> 05:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't know where Bishop Brady is so
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
probably more than that 26 credits or so
 
05:58:13.868 --> 05:58:13.878 align:start position:0%
some are asking for more which are
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
electives and this is an elective but
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
sort of like a required elective you
 
05:58:20.590 --> 05:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't graduate unless you do community
 
05:58:24.990 --> 05:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
service um so if that were to occur
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
would that be Al would that individual
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
student all of them all the kids that
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
are graduating it's small school only
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
small it's another door you're opening
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
up uh I'm open to the committee's
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
feedback on this but I think that that
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
would that would be reasonable and be
 
05:58:50.670 --> 05:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
allowed in this proposal now I have one
 
05:58:52.030 --> 05:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
other question for you and this is
 
05:58:54.030 --> 05:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
getting down into the
 
05:58:56.190 --> 05:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
finances we have a program called the
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
education tax credit M and that's done
 
05:59:01.390 --> 05:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
working with business other words they
 
05:59:03.590 --> 05:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
put this money in the kitty and you know
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
so much of it you know goes to state so
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
much goes to the individual that's going
 
05:59:10.750 --> 05:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
to you know for education purposes for
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
tuition where is the revenue coming for
 
05:59:17.708 --> 05:59:17.718 align:start position:0%
this $25 million it's tax credit yes but
 
05:59:19.990 --> 05:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
where's the revenue come
 
05:59:23.468 --> 05:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
from sure um I would say it would
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
probably be the same source of where uh
 
05:59:29.430 --> 05:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
student loan forgiveness is given to
 
05:59:32.910 --> 05:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
those um industries that receive the
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
student loan forgiveness credit here
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
that is a state program and I assume
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's the general funds but I'm not
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure of the answer of that um looks like
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
repun there're different sources like
 
05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
UNH offers Grant or grants as well but
 
05:59:51.708 --> 05:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
that's something they do internally
 
05:59:51.718 --> 05:59:52.628 align:start position:0%
that's something they do internally
within

05:59:52.628 --> 05:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
within
 
05:59:55.230 --> 05:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
UNH so the tuition you see is not
 
05:59:57.070 --> 05:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily Stu the tuition that the
 
05:59:59.628 --> 05:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
students pay it's usually a lot less we
 
06:00:01.350 --> 06:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
get that this is a very important
 
06:00:04.868 --> 06:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
question on any Bill yes um we are
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
flexible and um would expect that this
 
06:00:11.628 --> 06:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
would also uh be considered an economic
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
development possibility even though
 
06:00:13.680 --> 06:00:14.468 align:start position:0%
development possibility even though
they're

06:00:14.468 --> 06:00:14.478 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:00:17.070 --> 06:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofits because of the needs the
 
06:00:19.868 --> 06:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
Urgent needs even at our County nursing
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
homes Etc um this would be an added um
 
06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
value because of that so I think that
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
investment pays for itself in a way I
 
06:00:32.830 --> 06:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
also get that that is easy to say and
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're flexible in how to come to that
 
06:00:38.190 --> 06:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I do have one last follow up on all
 
06:00:40.590 --> 06:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
this we have a number of students in
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
this state that go to New London to
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
school for college kobby Sawyer and
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's because they want to get into the
 
06:00:50.350 --> 06:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
nursing program at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
06:00:52.548 --> 06:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
but it's a private
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
school um and and costly more so than
 
06:01:00.310 --> 06:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
unh um so we talked a little bit about
 
06:01:02.310 --> 06:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
the private colleges being eligible if
 
06:01:04.270 --> 06:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
they they go to a private college in New
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we our goal is to keep these
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
kids in New Hampshire and employed after
 
06:01:12.670 --> 06:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
they in New Hampshire after they
 
06:01:14.590 --> 06:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
graduate from college this would be
 
06:01:16.510 --> 06:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
another way of of
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
of accomplishing that end if we involv
 
06:01:23.548 --> 06:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
the private schools colleges that are in
 
06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
our state but then see that's then
 
06:01:27.868 --> 06:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
funding it is going to be a little bit
 
06:01:29.868 --> 06:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
different than than what you've
 
06:01:31.628 --> 06:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
initially talked about here because they
 
06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're not State
 
06:01:37.590 --> 06:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
schools represent luno figure out right
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
no no thank you very much Mr chair and
 
06:01:42.670 --> 06:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
um and could it could
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
it could it possibly also be done
 
06:01:48.030 --> 06:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
through through Partnerships with
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
private um institutions like Colby
 
06:01:53.390 --> 06:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
Sawyer uh in New London where they
 
06:01:57.390 --> 06:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the value of um of students uh
 
06:01:59.590 --> 06:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
commed to the state doing community
 
06:02:02.830 --> 06:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
service and potentially um a school like
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
kobby Sawyer could also issue tuition
 
06:02:08.030 --> 06:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
credits the same way uh our state
 
06:02:10.190 --> 06:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
universities or community colleges could
 
06:02:12.830 --> 06:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
do would that be a possibility I think
 
06:02:14.830 --> 06:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
yes that that could be a possibility in
 
06:02:17.468 --> 06:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
this proposal great thank
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
you yes represent
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
Damon I'm wondering if there was any
 
06:02:26.110 --> 06:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
consideration of uh evaluating a
 
06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
student's Financial need Or would simply
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:36.590 --> 06:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
qualify I mean whatever you want
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
to however you want to say we we are
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
flexible on this um initially it was not
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
need-based it was kind of dependent on
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of hours of service performed
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
it was available to all students kind of
 
06:02:52.230 --> 06:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of that um financial
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
situation but we we are flexible on that
 
06:02:58.510 --> 06:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
option again I think that goes to the
 
06:03:00.468 --> 06:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
point that current student loan
 
06:03:01.750 --> 06:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
forgiveness programs that are
 
06:03:03.708 --> 06:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
state-based I don't believe have any
 
06:03:07.230 --> 06:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
sort of income contingency um I do see a
 
06:03:09.990 --> 06:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
benefit to that but we're talking really
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
about the um value of service and that
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
can come from someone with a wealthy
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
background or someone not with a wealthy
 
06:03:21.628 --> 06:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
background that value stands on its own
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
flexible I definitely appreciate the
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
value of service and applaud that
 
06:03:31.310 --> 06:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
premise and I'm also trying to make the
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note look more
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
appealing nice maybe I'll just do it
 
06:03:39.230 --> 06:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective and then have
 
06:03:41.548 --> 06:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means figure this one
 
06:03:41.558 --> 06:03:44.548 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means figure this one
out

06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:03:46.868 --> 06:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
financially any any fur further
 
06:03:49.788 --> 06:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee on this
 
06:03:52.110 --> 06:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
bill do we have any other folks that
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on this represent
 
06:03:56.200 --> 06:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on this represent
Ford

06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.150 --> 06:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
is that thank you
 
06:04:06.910 --> 06:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
um if you move from service by
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
definition to experience-based
 
06:04:12.910 --> 06:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
education then you have a better
 
06:04:16.270 --> 06:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
position for asking for AP credit or
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
something like that which automatically
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
guarantees the
 
06:04:21.390 --> 06:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
transferability because it's
 
06:04:24.430 --> 06:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in a course and so you
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
created a course of experience
 
06:04:29.150 --> 06:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good point and that's the
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
nature and that moves it along as a
 
06:04:33.670 --> 06:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
course so when you transfer to another
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
College the question is do they exper
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
accept credit for experience-based
 
06:04:41.350 --> 06:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
education and that's increasingly common
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
these days could address that too thank
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that suggestion I think
 
06:04:47.468 --> 06:04:47.478 align:start position:0%
maybe incorporating that as a credit
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
would help it be more flexible to
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
transition between different schools
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
like you were mentioning so thank you
 
06:04:55.150 --> 06:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
for that suggestion I'll just say though
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that program works now
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
but I know in the past not every school
 
06:05:02.708 --> 06:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
would offer the same courses and so I
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
think that's dependent on the
 
06:05:06.510 --> 06:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
availability of that AP course I assume
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's still the case um my school only
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
offered it for sociology and psychology
 
06:05:14.030 --> 06:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason so I think it would
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
have to that would only be helpful if
 
06:05:19.750 --> 06:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
your school offers that college credit
 
06:05:23.390 --> 06:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
AP course but maybe you know more about
 
06:05:25.350 --> 06:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
one other thing I'd like to mention is
 
06:05:27.788 --> 06:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
that as currently written this proposal
 
06:05:29.910 --> 06:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
is available for college students to
 
06:05:31.948 --> 06:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
continue that work in service and
 
06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
receive tuition credit so thinking about
 
06:05:36.468 --> 06:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
maybe that's an option for high school
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
students performing service but um also
 
06:05:42.510 --> 06:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
would that kind of carryover once
 
06:05:45.390 --> 06:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're in college and taking college
 
06:05:47.548 --> 06:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
classes how to incorporate that as a
 
06:05:49.270 --> 06:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
class and I think that's going to depend
 
06:05:51.548 --> 06:05:51.558 align:start position:0%
largely on the college the college is
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
looking for the student they'll admit
 
06:05:56.590 --> 06:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
it further questions from the committee
 
06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
yes wood car represent
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hall how to do it thank you Mr chair and
 
06:06:05.708 --> 06:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I would
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
think um well I'm looking at this 20%
 
06:06:11.230 --> 06:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
number and I'm going to follow up on
 
06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative lad when he said high
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
schools um do indeed for for graduation
 
06:06:21.310 --> 06:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
they need to do community service uh so
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
would you
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
believe I have to make it a question so
 
06:06:26.750 --> 06:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I I guess I'm
 
06:06:29.310 --> 06:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
thinking think that we need to know you
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
need to know how many
 
06:06:33.310 --> 06:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
schools make that a requirement for
 
06:06:34.948 --> 06:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
graduation that they need to do so many
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
hours of community service because you
 
06:06:37.948 --> 06:06:37.958 align:start position:0%
could have a lot of schools at
 
06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
100% it wouldn't be 100% because they
 
06:06:42.510 --> 06:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
don't all go on to school but um it
 
06:06:44.788 --> 06:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
could be a lot more than this 20% number
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
so just I would suggest getting that
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
number that is a great thing to seek an
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
answer for thank you for raising that
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
06:06:55.920 --> 06:06:58.468 align:start position:0%
question thank
you

06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you and I
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
again after the representative Hall um I
 
06:07:06.590 --> 06:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
know it's the cause that work session as
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
you're here uh Morgan you won't be here
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
at the other time but as I was listening
 
06:07:12.430 --> 06:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the dialogue I was thinking when
 
06:07:14.230 --> 06:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
represent L talked about would they get
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer get credit for volunteering
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
that obviously that wouldn't be the same
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
if was it was a high school requirement
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
they really wouldn't be volunteering to
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
do the do the class but um beyond that I
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
was thinking reverse two two parts of
 
06:07:27.868 --> 06:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
your bill is how to get and the
 
06:07:29.468 --> 06:07:29.478 align:start position:0%
represent brought the big issue of the
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
dollar which is accurate is a big issue
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
one this one 25 million um if you did if
 
06:07:36.190 --> 06:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
you thought about two things a if you
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
made it only uh for high school
 
06:07:40.948 --> 06:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
youngsters going into college um if that
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
was your intent if you if that's small
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
of the bill and secondly if you're going
 
06:07:46.910 --> 06:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
to use do the reverse and had just
 
06:07:49.708 --> 06:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
College age youngsters participating
 
06:07:52.110 --> 06:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
then perhaps it could be something that
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would be reduced if they worked in
 
06:07:58.590 --> 06:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire after graduation so that
 
06:08:00.190 --> 06:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
would come off of there so you're
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
cutting Revenue but you're also working
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
to keep people inh just thoughts as
 
06:08:06.468 --> 06:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about um how on this
 
06:08:07.868 --> 06:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
construct for this bill how could
 
06:08:10.030 --> 06:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
possibly pass just thoughts thank you
 
06:08:11.350 --> 06:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
represent life
 
06:08:14.110 --> 06:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
leeway represent cordelli thank you
 
06:08:16.110 --> 06:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for bringing this
 
06:08:18.390 --> 06:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward and both being here um I would
 
06:08:20.590 --> 06:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
just point out the um when you're
 
06:08:23.548 --> 06:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
looking at the 20% um of students taking
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and the $25 million
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
per student
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
um that was based on just the uh high
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
school students but college students are
 
06:08:35.510 --> 06:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
also eligible for this right now so the
 
06:08:37.948 --> 06:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
cost could be considerably higher than
 
06:08:40.708 --> 06:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
the $25 million price tag in the fiscal
 
06:08:44.110 --> 06:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
note so you might want to consider um
 
06:08:46.750 --> 06:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
the eligible student population that
 
06:08:49.510 --> 06:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:56.910 --> 06:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
point any further questions or
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
brainstorming on this bill well
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's thank thank you very much and
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and to the committee
 
06:09:08.350 --> 06:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
and um it's been an honor to work with
 
06:09:10.150 --> 06:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
Miss Casey and I think maybe she's
 
06:09:12.468 --> 06:09:12.478 align:start position:0%
better at this than me and I'm honored
 
06:09:15.670 --> 06:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
to have brought this uh forward with her
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so um thank you Mr
 
06:09:20.788 --> 06:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the committee
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
the committee letting us present this
 
06:09:24.590 --> 06:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposal today um I also just want to
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
say once again thank you to
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative SCH and representative
 
06:09:30.468 --> 06:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
Leno for your guidance um and support in
 
06:09:32.948 --> 06:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
this Pursuit so thank you one of the
 
06:09:36.670 --> 06:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
things just to wrap it up when we moved
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
forward with the Dual and concurrent
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
enrollment program when we went forward
 
06:09:42.390 --> 06:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
of some of those programs which assist
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
high school students to get credits
 
06:09:48.590 --> 06:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
prior to graduating from high school we
 
06:09:51.350 --> 06:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
slid into the program rather than going
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
full boore we only had grades 11 and 12
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
we've since gone down to grades 10 11
 
06:10:02.110 --> 06:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
and 12 and we once had only stem courses
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
now we're allowing to be any course and
 
06:10:08.350 --> 06:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
so once you get get get it going get the
 
06:10:11.468 --> 06:10:11.478 align:start position:0%
roots in the ground then you can expand
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that's how we've done many program
 
06:10:14.670 --> 06:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
so it's something you might you know
 
06:10:18.390 --> 06:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
look at is it better to just go get 80%
 
06:10:21.868 --> 06:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
or 50% now and then expand it in a year
 
06:10:24.070 --> 06:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
or two once it really gets rolling
 
06:10:26.430 --> 06:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
something to consider excellent thank
 
06:10:28.830 --> 06:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that feedback
 
06:10:31.350 --> 06:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah all righty well with that we don't
 
06:10:33.310 --> 06:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
have any more testimony on that bill so
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
we'll conclude that hearing and we'll
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
see everybody tomorrow morning at what
 
06:10:41.150 --> 06:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
