00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
being 10 o'clock I'm going to open the
 
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee work session on House
 
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
Bill 109.
 
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding this is live
 
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
stream so we're going to use the
 
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
microphones and I'm sitting here
 
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.389 align:start position:0%
microphones and I'm sitting here
um

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
because you know Center for that
 
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.889 align:start position:0%
because you know Center for that
um

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
as I see it there's a couple of
 
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
different amendments being proposed
 
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire
 
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
um proposed one that we can talk about
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
oplc brought one and I mean does anybody
 
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
just initial thoughts on this before we
 
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
go get going further or
 
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
Carol's not here it's her
 
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
her bill so if there's nothing I mean as
 
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.089 align:start position:0%
her bill so if there's nothing I mean as
uh

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
as I read it and people can yes
 
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on
 
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was hoping that we
 
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
could just give a a quick overview I
 
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
don't have the original bill in front of
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
me okay and I don't have any extra
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
copies sorry
 
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
um or you can come over here and look at
 
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 align:start position:0%
it with me but
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 align:start position:0%
so it reenacts it repeals and reenacts
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
RSA 3206 C1 which is the occupational
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
therapists the definitions
 
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually Lindsay if you could come up
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
and talk about
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
the changes in the bill that you're
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
aware of and then
 
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.550 align:start position:0%
aware of and then
um

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
this amendment you're proposing might be
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
helpful to give an overview and then
 
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
talk about your Amendment sure thank you
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Chair by the record Lindsay Courtney
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc
 
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I would actually rely on the
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
association to speak in Greater detail
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
about the changes my understanding when
 
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
talking to members in the practice is
 
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
that essentially they were just intended
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
to tighten up the definitions and the
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for OTS that there are
 
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
many substantive changes
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's Amendment
 
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 align:start position:0%
ads language to include
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
Leisure Leisure social activity and the
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
like as within the definition of
 
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
Occupational Therapy Services what our
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would do is to make
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
um that individuals licensed under other
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
license types who are permitted to
 
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 align:start position:0%
perform similar services
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
are permitted to continue to do so
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
specifically recreational therapy we
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
were concerned that without the
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
additional language that the ACT could
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
be construed to require Rec therapists
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
to also seek licensure as occupational
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
therapists which are obviously two
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
distinct professions so that's why we
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
proposed that change
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um so if the folks from
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
the association come up and uh
 
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
oh yep there you go thank you Mr chair
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm Denise Finch occupational therapist
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire also a member of the
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
legislative committee for the New
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tea Association
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh I'm Daniel Wise from Concord and I'm
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
a certified occupational therapy
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
assistant and also on the uh from the
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
association's uh committee that working
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
for the language that
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire put in the
 
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 align:start position:0%
addendum that was just an inadvertent
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
exclusion initially that language has
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
always been part of the OT Practice Act
 
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
it was just left out inadvertently so
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
social participation play and Leisure is
 
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
not new it's just needs to be there it
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
used to be there so that's our focus on
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
that the oplc member Amendment we have
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
we are in support of because it's
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
consistent with other Allied Health
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
practice acts and protects all of the
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
practice acts as well as the public
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so if you could give your view on the
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
the overall Bill let's say with both of
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
those amendments if we were to do that
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
oh well we um we support the this this
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
bill we helped uh
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
um we helped to draft it it was
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh an update uh of The
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
Practice Act statute had for
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy had not been
 
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
updated since uh for about 14 years 14
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
or 15 years and uh well what we do has
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
not changed
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
um the way we do it and the way it was
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
described was was really out of date and
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
we looked to language that um our
 
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
National Association has developed in
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
other states to sort of harmonize our
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
practice with others so it it doesn't
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
really expand any um expand what we do
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing that uh sort of
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
change that it did make was it removed
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
some language
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
um Antiquated language about requiring a
 
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.010 align:start position:0%
um Antiquated language about requiring a
referral

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 align:start position:0%
referral
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
for certain
 
00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:20.689 align:start position:0%
for certain
um

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
certain therapy certain uses of
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
Occupational Therapy from a physician
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
which uh is something that is of concern
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
in this Medicaid in schools program
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and there that kids are they go
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
through special ed very regulated
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
process and occupational therapy is
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
included in in what they do and then the
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
schools were required to go through this
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary step of getting some doctor
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
to sign his name to the referral even
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
though the doctor was not necessarily
 
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.749 align:start position:0%
though the doctor was not necessarily
involved

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
in the assessment at all
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
and so that language was removed and
 
00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:04.370 align:start position:0%
and so that language was removed and
um

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of support for that as
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
well from the school uh special
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
education administrations
 
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
um which wrote in support of the bill
 
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.290 align:start position:0%
um which wrote in support of the bill
also

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
um this questions uh Peter
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair so uh do you have
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of experience under the
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
old regime if you will where doctors
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
were required to get involved
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh actually that's kind of a little
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
above my pay grade
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
um as an assistant uh I did therapy in
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
schools uh uh myself
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
um that was something that others in the
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
association uh who were familiar with
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
the school process
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
um well what I'm what I'm getting at is
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
that that you've already testified to
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
um it's an unnecessary action and very
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
often involving somebody who doesn't
 
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.430 align:start position:0%
often involving somebody who doesn't
know

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:04.339 align:start position:0%
as much about it as the practitioners do
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh but but to the degree that that this
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
person would be a gatekeeper
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh and his or her involvement would be
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
required now you've got to find somebody
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's willing to sit there and sign off
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
because to the agree that they're
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
signing their name they're going to want
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
to have some level of of ability to say
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
no otherwise they're just a rubber stamp
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
and and and very often people who are
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
highly qualified in a profession don't
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
like the idea that they're signing their
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
name to something that they really don't
 
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.470 align:start position:0%
name to something that they really don't
understand

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and so finding somebody that's
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
willing to do that is can be very
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
difficult and if you don't if you don't
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
have them it's kind of like in your note
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
from your mother you don't have it the
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
teacher says you're staying after class
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
or something like that so it's just a
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
constriction or restriction that serves
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
no purpose uh so I'm just wondering if
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
you if either one of you has any
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
experience at how much of a of a noose
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
and a roadblock a bottleneck this has
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
been in under the old system
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
well we know from our peers that are
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
working in the settings that
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
a tremendous burden for school systems
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
it limits and slows access to services
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
for students so we're very concerned
 
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:33.980 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
speech therapy and PT our Allied Health
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
profession Partners do not have this
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
restriction because they long ago
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
remove that requirement in their
 
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.220 align:start position:0%
practice act so we're really looking to
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
improve access to clients students but
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
also in the community so my background
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
is working as a private practitioner
 
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
with people with disabilities trying to
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
help them get back to work
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
and the limitation for me if I worked in
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
a work setting would be that I would
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
have to go find a physician to re
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
request my services I could be just
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
going in to do an ergonomic assessment
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
to you know improve the setup or making
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
an adaptation and so it's additional
 
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.060 align:start position:0%
expense into the system system
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
delay on the part of the client and then
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know delay on the provision of
 
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:30.140 align:start position:0%
services so
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the current status you know state of
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
health care you want to try to we want
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
to try to follow these leads of reducing
 
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:44.540 align:start position:0%
cost improving access making
 
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:48.260 align:start position:0%
clients have more control over you know
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
what they can get for services and where
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
and how quickly
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
right and the delay aspect of course is
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm chiefly concerned
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
with because if you've got somebody
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
who's I know suffering basically uh and
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
and and they they're having to sit and
 
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
and and they they're having to sit and
wait

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
like sitting at a traffic light that
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
just doesn't change after a while you
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
start to steam starts coming out of your
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
ear so I I am very supportive of getting
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
rid of that representative Barry you had
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
of microphone yeah
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's Friday I'm feeling a little bit
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
more relaxed
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
my question is what was the compelling
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
reason for coming here today what why
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
Dan wasn't even a first time
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um you mean for the bill itself or for
 
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.009 align:start position:0%
um you mean for the bill itself or for
today

00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
um well the the
 
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.710 align:start position:0%
um well the the
um

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
the access uh part the removing the
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
referral part was was a part of it but
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
the overall reason I mean the reason it
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't what we started with it was
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
basically the fact that this did need to
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
be updated was
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
um a big part of it it was just nodding
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
it not in concert with what
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
um existed elsewhere in terms of
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
language the language was just really
 
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.790 align:start position:0%
language the language was just really
antiquated

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
antiquated
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
so um anyone else
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
um have any questions okay all right
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
so director Courtney do you have any
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the agency isn't
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the bill one way or
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
um but uh would ask that if the bill
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
does move forward that the language
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
we've proposed be
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
um added just to make clear that we're
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
not requiring other licensed
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
professionals to obtain an OT license
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anyone else here who'd
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
like to speak on HB 109
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
okay I mean what I would you know in any
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
discussion that people have yep
 
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.530 align:start position:0%
discussion that people have yep
representative

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think that both
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
amendments are
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
um warranted to the bill and I would
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that we add the oplc language to
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
McGuire submitted and we submit we
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
present one Amendment to the committee
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
for this bill yeah that was my uh my
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
thought as well um well somebody else
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
wants to do it I can I can send this to
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
oplc and get that movie unless somebody
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
else is happy to do it
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
hola sorry I'll be glad to pop down
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
there after this meeting and take care
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
of it right away yeah get them to do a
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
new Amendment with both pieces correct
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you you're welcome any
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
any if there's any other discussion
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
okay so uh to be official I'll take uh
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
you know for the voting members uh which
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
I think with Replacements everybody here
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
but Peter
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
um so the motion is to adopt the
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Grotto
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
will have drafted that will combine
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire's Amendment
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
and the proposed amendment from oplc
 
00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:19.250 align:start position:0%
and the proposed amendment from oplc
um

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
well I I talked with Carol about this
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
and she said that
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
we can do this as the intent of the
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
committee the right now we you know it's
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
a full committee is going to have to
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
adopt the the amendment so this isn't
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
if we vote separately on the two
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
amendments sure then we put them
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
together and present that to the full
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I'd be glad to do that
 
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.269 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I'd be glad to do that
um

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:49.610 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.930 align:start position:0%
um
first

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%

and I will move adopting
 
00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:50.930 align:start position:0%

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
having this added to the other Amendment
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
for that I'll second that but let's also
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
note that when we do that Amendment 0030
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
will change number
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
I understand okay and I'll put you and I
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
as the sponsors of that Amendment that's
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
fine okay yeah I know they're
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
they don't change existing amendments
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
they always create a new one so yep
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right um any discussion on this one
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%

state and federal I think at 11 15 and I
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that my amendment is
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
in in hand for the Committees so I will
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
absent myself shortly but but I'll stay
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
as long as I can okay thank you and do
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:14.419 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open the subcommittee
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
 
00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
337

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
337
 
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
337
and

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is addressing a notice
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
and as I recall
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
there were a couple issues there was um
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
I think I don't know if it's actually
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
have to look here and see if it was a
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
formal Amendment
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
um it's not actually an official
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the sponsor said they made
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
a mistake concerning what part of
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
Statute they put it into
 
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
and that that as I recall resulted in
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment you know pass around
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
and because it was the wrong place it it
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know various things I guess had to
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
be reviewed by lawyers because it was in
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing part of it so there's that
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue and I guess there were issues
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
about the need for information becoming
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
public potential need to redact it and
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
then there's some other discussions but
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
um uh direct recording if you uh come up
 
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
um uh direct recording if you uh come up
and

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
please give your view on the situation
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney executive director
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
office of professional ice Insurance
 
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.750 align:start position:0%
office of professional ice Insurance
certification

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
the agency isn't taking a bill on or
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
um but we but we do recognize that
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stakeholder interest in
 
00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our operations are
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
transparent which we fully support we
 
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
had some concern around the original
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
language that it wouldn't give us enough
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
flexibility or the boards enough
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
flexibility to add items to board
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
agendas that were of an urgent nature
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
but not an emergency under RSA 91 a we
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
also had some concerns as you recall
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
about having to review every
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
um every piece of information or every
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
piece of materials prior to disclosure
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifically applications that may be
 
00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940 align:start position:0%
reviewed in public but
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
contain sensitive information that's
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
confidential so anyways I worked with
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and we came to a
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
agreement that would address my concerns
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
it would also address the issue with the
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
improper placement and that's what he
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
circulated I think yesterday to the
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee and essentially what it does
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
is it still requires the office to
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
provide the public notice of a public
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
meeting no less than 14 days prior to
 
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
it requires the board through the office
 
00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:36.349 align:start position:0%
it requires the board through the office
to

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
provide or make available all of the
 
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
information distributed to the board
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
unless the the materials contain
 
00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:46.149 align:start position:0%
unless the the materials contain
information

00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
exempt from disclosure under 91a so that
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
would satisfy Our concern with having to
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
um spend a lot of time redacting
 
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
um spend a lot of time redacting
applications

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
it also allows the chair of the board to
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
add agenda items within those seven days
 
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.329 align:start position:0%
add agenda items within those seven days
um

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
basically if in their discretion it's
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to do so to satisfy
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
public interest and then it provides for
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
a basis for us to provide those
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
materials to the public
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
so again we don't take a position on it
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
but I think it you know I think
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
certainly it'll address the physical
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
concerns as well
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's a good
 
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.650 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's a good
um

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
anyways it's a good compromise I think
 
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.890 align:start position:0%
anyways it's a good compromise I think
okay

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you so um you spoke with
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Martian uh Prime sponsor
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
he's happy with with this yes correct
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay I've got a
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
couple questions one one concern about
 
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:44.930 align:start position:0%
couple questions one one concern about
[Music]

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
see where's the part here about uh
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
not making materials available
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
if they have private information
 
00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
so I just got this
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
are you talking about that the 91a yep
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
it says all materials distributed to the
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
board for the meeting shall be available
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the public no less than seven days
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
prior to the meeting yeah my question on
 
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:19.530 align:start position:0%
that my concern is
 
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:19.910 align:start position:0%
that my concern is
[Music]

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what these
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
materials look like and I'm wondering if
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know a large portion of them have
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
some private information on them along
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
with information that really the public
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
should have access to and whether
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
putting this exception in
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
rather than you know the redacting
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
process is going to
 
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.650 align:start position:0%
process is going to
cover

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
most of the material or only you know
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's a material to private information
 
00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
tend to be
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know Limited in at least the
 
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
documents that contain it
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a legitimate a
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
concern I would say
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
most documents reviewed in public
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
session do not contain personal
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
information or information confidential
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
under 91a the
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
um the type of materials that I'm
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking about are licensure applications
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
which are public documents and can be
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
released but we have to redact you know
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
their social security number which is
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
required and their personal email
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
address and all of that stuff and when
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
talking to representative Merchant and
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
some of the other stakeholders they said
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
they really weren't interested in those
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
types of documents and it would
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the cost of having
 
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:36.500 align:start position:0%
us review applications to redact the
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
materials if we could just exempt that
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
those type of materials
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay and you said they're they're public
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
documents so today what would they be
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
released under 91a and then you do the
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
redacting at that point yes we do do
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
that yep okay
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um anybody any comp questions or from
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know representative Grotto went off
 
00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:07.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bear
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
hey there sorry Mr chair if
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm brand new with this so if I if I uh
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
don't don't just go on okay
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so I did have a constituent come to
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
me and I did reach out to
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
um director Courtney
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
regarding adding to the agenda the
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
language of
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
director director Courtney I don't know
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
if you remember exactly the exact
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
language yes that has come up within 48
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hours something to that effect yes I can
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
look that up I don't know whether it's
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
too late to add that or whether that
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
would is within the 91a
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
is are you concerned about uh but you
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
want them to have the ability to add
 
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.450 align:start position:0%
want them to have the ability to add
things

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.770 align:start position:0%
things
um

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the last minute if they feel
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
necessary in that language I believe is
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
says the chair of the board counselor
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
commission shall be permitted to add a
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
gen items to the agenda within seven
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
days by meeting if in the chair's
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
discretion The public's interest in the
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
board addressing the matter outweighs
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the Public's interest in timely access
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
to materials associated with the new
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
agenda item
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
just kind of in the middle we don't know
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
why numbers but what line is that Mr
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
chair with their own online number this
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
is this is a document I handed out
 
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:36.740 align:start position:0%
the draft the draft legislation
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
I kind of have a concern about that
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
although I understand the reason for it
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something that could be
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
abused I would hope it would not be
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
I suppose if we hear about it a lot of
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
problems with being abused we could
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm I'm thinking that
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
um where representative Merchant who was
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
a board member brought this whole issue
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
to us that if issues such as that come
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
up they will certainly be brought before
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
that I imagine so thank you and
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative grow to anything on this
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
this is the notice
 
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:29.630 align:start position:0%
this is the notice
um

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be um if you're referring
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
to the amendment that oplc submitted
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
correct yes no I have no questions okay
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
um is there anybody else uh present
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
who'd like and thank you anybody else
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
here president who wants to speak on uh
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
good morning representative and thank
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
you for
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
um letting me speak for a few minutes I
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
think to representative a bear's
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
comments I think where I represent the
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
electrical contractors and I believe one
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
of it and what what's your name yes oh
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
sorry Simon Thompson with no
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
p-t-h-o-m-s-o-n I represent the ecba
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
electrical contractors Business
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm not going to go
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
through a list I also have several other
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
clients who are um just the ones that
 
00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099 align:start position:0%
yeah no so
 
00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:24.050 align:start position:0%
yeah no so
um

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
I think just seeing uh director
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
Courtney's language
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
we number one we're wanting to know when
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the meetings are 14 days in advance and
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's what this does we wanted to have
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
the material that's going to be
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
discussed as soon as possible that says
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
seven days the language about you know
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
kind of high priority sensitive matters
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
that need to be dealt with in a timely
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
manner we understand that a good example
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts reciprocal issue came
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the electrician's
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
board like literally the day of before
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
the meeting and it was a big hot button
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
issue so yeah we want to talk about that
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner I haven't heard
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
directly back from my client having just
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
seen this I would just say at this point
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
what makes me feel pretty comfortable is
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it says uh in the chairs discretion
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
the chair of that board if if he or she
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
feels that we need to deal with this
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
then I think we feel pretty comfortable
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
with it I'd like to review it maybe
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
discuss it if we do have major concerns
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
if the full committee's executive
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
session but I just wanted to weigh in
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
that I think this this accomplishes a
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
lot like what we'd like to see okay I
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
mean I I suspect that the full committee
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know that uh the chair or the
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
full committee would be having people
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
comment it might it's possible but right
 
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
clients and I've been communicating with
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
him as well as communicating with
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
director Courtney and I'll keep him
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 337 no okay
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
any comments or discussions for members
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
sounding as though everyone is pretty
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the amended proposal
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
if you would like I can have it drafted
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
as an official amendment that we can
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
okay so you can make a motion make a
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt this proposed amendment
 
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
any discussion I'm guessing no
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%

01:17:13.159 --> 01:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
258.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
258.
 
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.970 align:start position:0%
258.
um

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
just a little you know my take on what's
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
been going on in it and you know
 
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.330 align:start position:0%
been going on in it and you know
actually

01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly or someone correct
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
me and that is the original bill
 
01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:33.229 align:start position:0%
me and that is the original bill
um

01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
it came out of Olas nothing like what
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor wanted and because of
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
the ols's under the problems they've had
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
and delays there was no chance to
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
redraft it so that's
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what happened there
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
and there was an amendment to try and
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
deal with that which
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
the discussions we had at the committee
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
seem to indicate uh here it is
 
01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:03.140 align:start position:0%
there were that that was not
 
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
accomplishing what the prime sponsor
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
wanted either and you can speak Diane if
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
you want to come up
 
01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:10.490 align:start position:0%
you want to come up
Diane

01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
Diane
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up for a moment
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
sorry should be official
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
I've known you too much too well so I
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
tell you do that
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh you know it it's corrected the
 
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
original Bill wasn't what you wanted and
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
is it also true that the amendment is
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily doing what you'd prefer
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of okay with my Amendment okay
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
um but I realize that there are people
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
who are not and I am willing to discuss
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
ways to make everybody happy and
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
actually I'm trying to find your
 
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.870 align:start position:0%
actually I'm trying to find your
Amendment

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay actually here's why that's why I'm
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
not finding it
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
no no no no
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
I know I've got it here
 
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.330 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
do you have the um do you have the
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
amendment I have her um Amendment this
 
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
is uh zero zero five one eight yeah
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
as I recall there was concern that
 
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
as I recall there was concern that
um

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
I mean what this does is it says the
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
practice of veterinary medicine shall
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
not include any treatment offered by a
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
person licensed under RSA 316a which I
 
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um part of the statute
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
but while that that statute does not
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
indicate that it's specifically for
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
humans that was the intent I suppose you
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
know if alien warthogs came down to
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
earth they might be uh could be
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
practiced under there but that's not
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
what the uh uh you know chiropractors
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
are trained for and so this really
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't have I mean 316a doesn't have
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
anything to do
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
with animals and so you know I would
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that that this isn't going to do
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
what was wanted so any comments on that
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.530 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
um

01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
and as I understand the basic concern is
 
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
and as I understand the basic concern is
that

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
there are people practicing animal
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic the
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
um get a little history as I understand
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
the veterinary board believes that they
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
come under their Authority the language
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
and the veterinary part of the statute
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
is Broad enough they may very well be
 
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.830 align:start position:0%
is Broad enough they may very well be
correct

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.729 align:start position:0%
correct
um

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
and people practicing animal
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic right now are um
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
it's kind of in the gray area they're
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're legal or not in the
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
past but not recently there's been some
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
cease and desist letters we've heard
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that that some are reluctant
 
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
to expand their practice or advertise
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
because they're concerned about their
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
there's an uh amendment that was I asked
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh director Courtney from oplc to put
 
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh director Courtney from oplc to put
together

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.169 align:start position:0%
together
that

01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
says an individual certified to provide
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic Services that's in
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
the exception section
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
but an individual certified to provide
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic Services by a board
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
recognized National certification body
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
so this would
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
would have the veterinary board
 
01:21:57.239 --> 01:21:57.950 align:start position:0%
would have the veterinary board
um

01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
hopefully approve some one or more
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
National National certification bodies
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
as acceptable certification for someone
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
to do animal Chiropractic
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
and that that would be the extent of any
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
regulation on the
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
so representative short
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question regarding
 
01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question regarding
that

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
um I assume that director Courtney has
 
01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:26.060 align:start position:0%
been in touch with the veterinary board
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
and this would obviously take action on
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
their part to determine as you say
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
nationally certified
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Mr chair um
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney executive director oplc
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
so the veterinary board has reviewed the
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
initial language attorney Elizabeth
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
Eaton is here and can speak about the
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
board's position on the original
 
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
board's position on the original
language

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I have not reviewed this draft with
 
01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
them as they have not met obviously our
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
intent would be to do so but they have
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
not taken a position on this at that
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
time at this time
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone here
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
um from the veterinary board or
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
representing them who could comment on
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
this on the
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable committee members
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
um my name is Elizabeth Eaton I'm here
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
from oplc on behalf of the board of
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine we discussed the
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
original language of this
 
01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:45.950 align:start position:0%
original language of this
um

01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
bill at the recent meeting
 
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:52.580 align:start position:0%
their discussion was fairly succinct
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
they do not want to be in the business
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
of certifying chiropractors they they
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
oppose the language of the original bill
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
I have not as director Courtney said
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
have not taken this amendment back to
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
if any questions
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
that was the original indication that I
 
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:20.900 align:start position:0%
had gotten but now we have this new
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
proposal I would suggest that we should
 
01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:25.570 align:start position:0%
proposal I would suggest that we should
actually

01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:25.580 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
wait for final action on this until we
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
get the verification from the board that
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're willing to do that since it's
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to take action on this it's not an
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
if that's any other comment and do I
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if we have
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
that comment from the veterinary board
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
and it's something they don't object to
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be something that I
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that whatever
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
steps we take today
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
is going to get us to where
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up in it with a happy
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
solution for everyone so if it would be
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
possible for us to give us to give
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
everybody a summary of what would happen
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
if the veterinary board
 
01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.350 align:start position:0%
if the veterinary board
um

01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
what your position might be
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that we have an idea of what
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
direction we're heading in
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
So based on their discussion uh at the
 
01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
last meeting I I don't know that they
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be entirely opposed to this
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment here uh it it seems that it
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
would just be that they'd have to
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
promulgate some rules uh to recognize
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
certain certifications
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
that the problem that they have is what
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
happens when an animal chiropractor
 
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.250 align:start position:0%
happens when an animal chiropractor
um

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
requires discipline
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
who's doing the discipline who's
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
sanctioning the animal chiropractor and
 
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
that was one of the they don't want to
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
be doing that right and thank you and
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
anything else any other questions
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
um okay so let's just say that we have a
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
group of Veterinary chiropractors who
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
have gone through the certain
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
accreditation program
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
is that something that the veterinary
 
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
board would be willing to
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
up approve without certification can we
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
do that without certified I mean yeah I
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
mean the other option would be in the
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
exception thing to basically put
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
language in there that said that animal
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
chiropractors don't come under the
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
authority of the veterinary board and
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to worry about them
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
at all and I'm wondering what their
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
position might be on that although I
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a guess
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
based on their discussion it seemed like
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
they'd be in favor of that really if
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
kind of a tough area because this has
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
been we you know we looked up
 
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.510 align:start position:0%
been we you know we looked up
um

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
if this is happening currently in New
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it is
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
the board just seems to not want to
 
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
touch it
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but they could change their mind
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
based on the new language and the
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
exception I I don't know okay
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible uh or
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative bear a bear
 
01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.470 align:start position:0%
representative bear a bear
foreign

01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
is it possible since the representation
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
of the veterinary board is here and
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
saying they don't have a problem with
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
the amendment for us just to move it
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
forward well it it's not clear I think
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
my Pro I mean I don't know we can have
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
the discussion but in one option
 
01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.189 align:start position:0%
the discussion but in one option
um

01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
be I mean it's it's going on right now I
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
have I don't know if people have heard
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
of reports of there being problems
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
um one options to make it clearer to
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
just clarify their position to say that
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
they they don't come under the authority
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
of the veterinary board and let things
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
continue as they are
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
um which I'd be okay with I don't know
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.159 --> 01:28:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
do not feel comfortable giving a
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
specific answer but I would be happy to
 
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
take that back okay um the other thing
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
is if we schedule a and if we let this
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
wait and schedule another subcommittee
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
hearing it'll be good if
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
I know I don't know if there's anyone
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
who can speak for the board but if they
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
could be here uh yes representative I'm
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
just curious how often uh does the board
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
meet or is it just when a meeting is
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
called can can that happen uh relatively
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
they meet monthly
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative they meet every month
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative crota
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
so let's just say that
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
let's take so one one position might be
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
that this would not fall under their
 
01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.790 align:start position:0%
that this would not fall under their
jurisdiction

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
and then another position might be that
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
they would accept jurisdiction for those
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that are certified through
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
this any program
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
but would not include but would not be a
 
01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
but would not include but would not be a
certification

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that I mean is there such a thing in
 
01:29:13.679 --> 01:29:16.790 align:start position:0%
that I mean is there such a thing in
oplc

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
director

01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
so um typically the way a board receives
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is through a mandatory
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
certification or through a certification
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
a license or registration that's issued
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
so this um actually they would not have
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction if they were approving
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
National certification bodies they would
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
basically it would be saying
 
01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:44.270 align:start position:0%
basically it would be saying
um

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think the way I would read it is
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
saying you know this generally Falls
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
within the scope
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
um except we're going to exempt from
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
license from the licensure requirement
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
these particular individuals
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
um so I think arguably one can make the
 
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.410 align:start position:0%
um so I think arguably one can make the
uh

01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
um this would some this would be
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
something we'd have to talk about back
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
at the office but I think one could make
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
the argument that if somebody doesn't
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
meet this requirement is not required to
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
be licensed and is providing such
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
services that the veterinary board could
 
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.410 align:start position:0%
services that the veterinary board could
proceed

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
um with an unlicensed practice action
 
01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
usually through the consumer protection
 
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:23.900 align:start position:0%
division of the Department of Justice
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay because my concern is
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know Chiropractic Chiropractic this
 
01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:31.790 align:start position:0%
you know Chiropractic Chiropractic this
this

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
procedure is conducted on not only dogs
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
but it's also conducted on horses I mean
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a real thing right and I would
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
hate to
 
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
hate to
um

01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
I don't want to compare it to you know a
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
heart transplant because it's but at the
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
same time I feel some sort of
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
um at least have some some sort of guard
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
rails on the thing so that large animals
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
are which are a completely different
 
01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.410 align:start position:0%
are which are a completely different
thing

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
than a dog and which is different than a
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
human at least there's some sort of
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
feeling you know there's this program
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
that you have to be certified so that
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
just not anybody who thinks they're a
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
chiropractor can go out to somebody's
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
farm and treat their animals that's all
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about that
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
if I may respond representative so
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's so again oplc is not taking a
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
position and
 
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:31.610 align:start position:0%
position and
um

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
but that's why I drafted the language to
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
require the board recognize a national
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
certification body it seemed like a
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise because
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
um you know I think there could be a
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern that people would
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
just start providing this service and
 
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.290 align:start position:0%
just start providing this service and
have

01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
um no not be qualified to do so
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question I mean I can see that
 
01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:56.420 align:start position:0%
they might have concern that they're
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
approving certain National
 
01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
certifications and there's a requirement
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you're going to practice legally you
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
have to have that certification but then
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
all of the other stuff that goes with
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
most licensing wouldn't be there I don't
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
know disciplining all that which I'm not
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
looking for but is there any anywhere
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
else any other uh thing in licensing
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
where something like this is done where
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that a
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
practitioner gets some private
 
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized certification and
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
then that's it
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
that the the state doesn't do anything
 
01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:46.430 align:start position:0%
that the the state doesn't do anything
further

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
yeah we we don't think there is I mean
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's very common for as a part of either
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
statute or rules for a licensed
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
individual to have a certification which
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
is the basis for the licensure
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but we're not familiar off the top of
 
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
our heads with basically a requirement
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
to have a voluntary certification
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
through a private organization to be
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
exempt from licensure
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative short
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
um I I'm in favor of waiting until
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
um these two Alternatives can be
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
presented to the actual board members
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
and hear from them
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
if they have a preference one way or the
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
other whether what is the total
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
exemption or the The Proposal from
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
can we can we wait that long schedule
 
01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.209 align:start position:0%
can we can we wait that long schedule
okay

01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:44.219 --> 01:33:45.410 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative so I'm I'm not saying
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
that I want certification but I like to
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
have some sort of if there's a way that
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
oplc can examine that and then once we
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
have statute we can put that into
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that it would fall under the
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.250 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
right

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay good I mean that makes sense if
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
that can work
 
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.850 align:start position:0%
that can work
um

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
because I certainly don't want to set up
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know a whole licensing regimen for
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
the normal thing for animal Chiropractic
 
01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.669 align:start position:0%
the normal thing for animal Chiropractic
so

01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah if that can work that would be um
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
and a representative uh Kelly if you
 
01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.370 align:start position:0%
and a representative uh Kelly if you
could

01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
contact people that you know that are
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually doing this
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
to get some idea of do they tend to be
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
certified by some national body do they
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
tend not to and what their view is maybe
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
either somebody could come in whenever
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
we reschedule this or you could bring
 
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
the information back
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah and and maybe she could refer you
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
to somebody else or maybe you know
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
somebody to to get some information
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so we know what
 
01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.970 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so we know what
we're

01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
what we're messing with so
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right um anyone else out there want
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my name is
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
Simon Thompson I work with a firm Sheen
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
Finney Capital group and uh I'm here on
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new the New Hampshire
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
State Chiropractic Society
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday afternoon uh the president
 
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire State Chiropractic
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
Society Matt's wise sent the entire
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
board an email excuse me at the entire
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
comedian email which kind of outlines
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
where we're at and I think the the the
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
the the first message we want to deliver
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
is that we're not opposed to
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
chiropractors you know treating animals
 
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
um but the the original bill and the
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
sponsor's amendment
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
we were initially neutral but then
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
opposed to it the language that director
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
Courtney just presented is something
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
that I think we would again probably
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
move back to neutral what our concern is
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
and in that email that that Dr swice
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
sent yesterday is that
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
when you go to Chiropractic College it's
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
to learn how to treat humans okay and
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's important to
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
chiropractors when they get a new
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
patient who's you know I have to try to
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
read this word that's that are that are
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
have you know musculoskeletal complaints
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore a chiropractor could
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps address that when they come in
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
they still need to they're trained in
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
that college to to know what those red
 
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
flags are that is this is this a cancer
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
tumor that's causing this pain and
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
therefore we need to get you out of our
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
office into somebody who can handle that
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
so if we're just going to say that oh
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
yeah you can you can treat animals or
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
horses without any guardrails or
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
certification to identify the red flags
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
that they do not know about because they
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
were not trained to do that in their
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
college that's a concern for them
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I think if you get a chance to take a
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
look at it you'll see some pretty good
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
examples of of why we're concerned with
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
the original bill and the amendment and
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
why the language just got brought to
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
your attention from oplc we would
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
probably be neutral on
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing I just want
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
to let people know is that our
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
association is the largest Association
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
of the chiropractors in New Hampshire
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
and we're estimating that maybe five
 
01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
percent do this
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and and and so that is kind of where
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
we're at that you know I think I think
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
that the Avenue you guys are approaching
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
to maybe slow the train down and hear
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
from the veterinarian board and if we
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
can schedule another a subcommittee work
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
session I can have an actual
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
chiropractor who's more technically
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable than I am to come in and
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
kind of express our concerns uh that
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
would be great but I'm here today to say
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
that we were opposed to the amended
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
version of Representative Kelly's bill
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
but this language that director uh
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
Courtney just brought forward we could
 
01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.149 align:start position:0%
Courtney just brought forward we could
be

01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
neutral on
 
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for him
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wants to speak on House
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 258.
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
here so I mean
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
I yeah I'm I'm in favor of um waiting
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
and scheduling another subcommittee
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
meeting as you say this isn't an early
 
01:38:29.649 --> 01:38:29.659 align:start position:0%
Bill and so we have some time to wait to
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I was good do we
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
need a motion to just postpone to the
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee meeting or I don't
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
know but we can make one yes okay I
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
don't think so but okay then let's just
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
wait okay all right uh so we're I'm
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
gonna close the work session on House
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 258 and we're back at one o'clock
 
01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.020 --> 03:05:00.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:05:00.769 --> 03:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
hey I'm going to open the subcommittee
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
work session and a house bill 409 and um
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
I think at the last
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
at the you know after the meeting last
 
03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:13.730 align:start position:0%
at the you know after the meeting last
time

03:05:13.730 --> 03:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:05:13.740 --> 03:05:14.450 align:start position:0%
time
um

03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:19.490 --> 03:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
we asked um director Courtney
 
03:05:21.769 --> 03:05:21.779 align:start position:0%
um to you know propose an amendment to
 
03:05:23.690 --> 03:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
deal with some concern she had and we
 
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
have that before us
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
and there were two issues one is
 
03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
just having the license doesn't mean
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
there aren't problems that isn't
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
suspended or something like that so she
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
had it in good standing
 
03:05:38.809 --> 03:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
and then there was kind of a technical
 
03:05:41.809 --> 03:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
fix that the original bills had States
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that would have excluded DC and so
 
03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
it's changed its jurisdiction
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so if you'd like to make you know
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and and make any
 
03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
comments you have on it hello my name is
 
03:05:57.290 --> 03:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
Lauren Warner um I am general counsel
 
03:05:58.730 --> 03:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
for the office of professional licensure
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
as well as oversee board council at oplc
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I am here on behalf of oplc as well
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
as I can answer questions regarding the
 
03:06:08.210 --> 03:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
board stance because I was at the uh
 
03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
their last Cosmo meeting
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
and what was your name again I'm sorry
 
03:06:21.769 --> 03:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
and um so you're speaking for oplc and
 
03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
the board so if you can
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
comment on on the amendment that uh that
 
03:06:34.250 --> 03:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
director Courtney proposed would you
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
like to make a comment on it on behalf
 
03:06:38.570 --> 03:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
of oplc or as the board why don't you do
 
03:06:40.010 --> 03:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
one and then the other yes so so
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
essentially for oplc they aren't taking
 
03:06:44.809 --> 03:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
a position on the bill but director
 
03:06:47.929 --> 03:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
Courtney drafted this language to amend
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that oplc had as
 
03:06:52.730 --> 03:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
well as adding more clarity as you had
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
correctly stated
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
um essentially the prior version allowed
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
for anyone who maybe have had a
 
03:07:04.130 --> 03:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
probation as a suspended license
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
um has a license but it's not
 
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
technically in good standing due to
 
03:07:10.849 --> 03:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
discipline I could obtain licensure
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
automatically in New Hampshire by the
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
basis of just having a license so this
 
03:07:19.370 --> 03:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
amendment would remove those concerns
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
and allow only those who are in good
 
03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:23.269 align:start position:0%
and allow only those who are in good
standing

03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
um in another jurisdiction to obtain
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
licensure via reciprocity one thing I to
 
03:07:30.530 --> 03:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
talk about with director Courtney oh
 
03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry oh go on um just a little
 
03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
bit earlier this morning was maybe
 
03:07:36.530 --> 03:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
adding to it and defining what in good
 
03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:37.550 align:start position:0%
adding to it and defining what in good
standing

03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
entails um Inwood standing is common
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
language to use but in some board rules
 
03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
we could certainly address that there
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
Define what in good standing is I know
 
03:07:48.830 --> 03:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
also the mental health
 
03:07:50.929 --> 03:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
licensure they are looking for
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
conditional license in good standing and
 
03:07:54.530 --> 03:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
we're looking also for endorsement to
 
03:07:54.540 --> 03:07:55.730 align:start position:0%
we're looking also for endorsement to
Define

03:07:55.730 --> 03:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
Define
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
you know what Ingot standing really
 
03:07:59.389 --> 03:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
meant how did does it mean you held a
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
license for a certain amount of years
 
03:08:02.769 --> 03:08:02.779 align:start position:0%
and now you're qualified does it mean
 
03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
there is no past pending or current
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
discipline because essentially someone
 
03:08:09.530 --> 03:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
could be in current good standing but
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
had past discipline
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire boards may want to look
 
03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
at what happened in that past discipline
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
and would that cause a public safety
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I think that in good standings is
 
03:08:27.230 --> 03:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that can be addressed in rules
 
03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that we would I would
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that we do that okay
 
03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representative
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
I know this isn't your field but
 
03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the recent case in
 
03:08:46.010 --> 03:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
Florida where literally thousands of
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
nursing qualifications that were put
 
03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:50.170 align:start position:0%
nursing qualifications that were put
forward

03:08:50.170 --> 03:08:50.180 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
were shown to be fake and there have
 
03:08:57.769 --> 03:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
been I think 25 or 26 arrests involving
 
03:08:57.779 --> 03:08:58.670 align:start position:0%
been I think 25 or 26 arrests involving
that

03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:58.680 --> 03:08:59.210 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
do you know if if New Hampshire would
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
have the capability of
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
um discovering something of that nature
 
03:09:11.809 --> 03:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
in this field if that was the case
 
03:09:13.490 --> 03:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so I can speak to nursing first
 
03:09:15.290 --> 03:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
because I um and board Council for
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
nursing uh they are part so we've been
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
working with federal law authorities and
 
03:09:22.849 --> 03:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
are given identifying names when they
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
confirm those who have possibly attended
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
schools that were actually
 
03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
like a paid for graduate degree so we've
 
03:09:33.170 --> 03:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
been giving regular lists for those that
 
03:09:35.570 --> 03:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire licensed nurses and
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
are then the board is reviewing those
 
03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
and bringing in to them for show cause
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
or adjudications and determining had
 
03:09:44.210 --> 03:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
they had other criteria and education
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
that could meet for
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
um Cosmo
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
similarly they could look into that if
 
03:09:53.210 --> 03:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
there was perhaps information that came
 
03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
out and similarly federal legal
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
authorities wanted to send that
 
03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
information one benefit with nursing is
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
they have a compact so information can
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
be spread Nationwide among those compact
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
states there isn't a compact for
 
03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:11.389 align:start position:0%
states there isn't a compact for
cosmetology

03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
let's have questions and this is on
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
there representing basically oplc's
 
03:10:15.359 --> 03:10:16.730 align:start position:0%
there representing basically oplc's
position

03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:10:19.070 --> 03:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then for the board for the
 
03:10:20.929 --> 03:10:20.939 align:start position:0%
board they had previously submitted
 
03:10:23.389 --> 03:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony at the full committee
 
03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
session last week essentially there it
 
03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
session last week essentially there it
discusses

03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
discusses
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
Health sanitary Infectious Disease
 
03:10:35.210 --> 03:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
Control concerns just based on the
 
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
training that New Hampshire
 
03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists are required to have to
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
be licensed that is a big part of their
 
03:10:44.210 --> 03:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
training as well as it's one of the main
 
03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
concerns the board sees from in
 
03:10:49.450 --> 03:10:49.460 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions as or as well as
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
inspections they're routinely if someone
 
03:10:55.370 --> 03:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
fails an inspection I would say about 90
 
03:10:57.969 --> 03:10:57.979 align:start position:0%
of the time it has to do with
 
03:11:00.530 --> 03:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
poor sanitary consist condition
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
conditions instruments that are not
 
03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
properly cleaned or sanitized of that
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
nature so they were concerned as to
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
would it potentially open up some states
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
just because of automatic licensure they
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
weren't required to meet the
 
03:11:15.420 --> 03:11:16.670 align:start position:0%
weren't required to meet the
substantially

03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know subsimilar or more than
 
03:11:20.809 --> 03:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
language that potentially they could
 
03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
allow for those who have less training
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
in those areas could be licensed
 
03:11:28.190 --> 03:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so that was one of their concerns as
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
well as generally what
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney's sorry director
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Courtney's Amendment addresses
 
03:11:37.250 --> 03:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
having anyone who could be licensed a
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
suspended license in another state could
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
be like have an active license in New
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is someone regularly have poor
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
inspection reports and is still
 
03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
maintained licensure whereas in New
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they would have taken action
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
on that license based on that
 
03:11:51.650 --> 03:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action they wouldn't
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily be allowed to as the
 
03:11:55.969 --> 03:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
original language were to go forward
 
03:11:55.979 --> 03:11:57.769 align:start position:0%
original language were to go forward
foreign

03:11:57.769 --> 03:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:11:59.929 --> 03:11:59.939 align:start position:0%
so what's somebody let's say they go
 
03:12:01.610 --> 03:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
from one state to the other they come
 
03:12:03.650 --> 03:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
here and we give them a license
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
once they get that license it's a New
 
03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license so they have to follow
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire rules correct yes but
 
03:12:14.210 --> 03:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
their concern is essentially coming in
 
03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't necessarily have to
 
03:12:18.050 --> 03:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
follow New Hampshire rules for initial
 
03:12:19.010 --> 03:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
licensure because it would be
 
03:12:20.450 --> 03:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
reciprocity so they wouldn't have to
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
meet the same training
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
um eventually at renewal time they would
 
03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
have to follow those it was just more of
 
03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
a concern regarding what could
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
potentially happen in those first two
 
03:12:33.230 --> 03:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
years if someone doesn't have the same
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
training qualifications in some of those
 
03:12:36.889 --> 03:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
areas where they see significant
 
03:12:36.899 --> 03:12:38.750 align:start position:0%
areas where they see significant
problems

03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:12:41.929 --> 03:12:41.939 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to hire them let's
 
03:12:41.939 --> 03:12:43.130 align:start position:0%
so if somebody were to hire them let's
say

03:12:43.130 --> 03:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:12:46.969 --> 03:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
and those individuals were not following
 
03:12:49.730 --> 03:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
the hygiene rules that the
 
03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
shop owner has or the manager of the
 
03:12:56.769 --> 03:12:56.779 align:start position:0%
established they would have the right to
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
request that the proper
 
03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:00.889 align:start position:0%
request that the proper
hygiene

03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
hygiene
 
03:13:04.370 --> 03:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
is followed correct right these people
 
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just trying to figure out
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
how because I think that
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
getting to
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.530 --> 03:13:20.540 align:start position:0%
it's because it's it's such a
 
03:13:20.540 --> 03:13:22.130 align:start position:0%
it's because it's it's such a
diverse

03:13:22.130 --> 03:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
diverse
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing yes
 
03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:25.309 align:start position:0%
thing yes
and

03:13:25.309 --> 03:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
it's wide and shallow
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean as opposed to
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
narrow and deep
 
03:13:33.290 --> 03:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
and when something is wide and shallow
 
03:13:37.010 --> 03:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's hard to sort of like maneuver your
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
way through these things
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
so my thought is that
 
03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:44.809 align:start position:0%
so my thought is that
we

03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.610 --> 03:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
um my thing my thinking is that we
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
accept a presented I mean a director
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
Courtney's Amendment
 
03:13:58.250 --> 03:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
we amend 409 to say that
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
we pass 409 as amended with that rule
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
and then we put this the good standing
 
03:14:09.290 --> 03:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
definition in rules
 
03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
um there has to be some way that the
 
03:14:16.370 --> 03:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
board can communicate to their business
 
03:14:16.380 --> 03:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
board can communicate to their business
owners

03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
owners
 
03:14:20.210 --> 03:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
that you know if they're concerned about
 
03:14:23.210 --> 03:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
this they're going to have to
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
enforce that kind of practice in their
 
03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
own business yes you know what I mean
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes somebody has to hold the ball and
 
03:14:32.809 --> 03:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
and I it's I really don't think that you
 
03:14:36.849 --> 03:14:36.859 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna have
 
03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists lining up at the border
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
to become a New Hampshire
 
03:14:46.130 --> 03:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
licensed owner but at the same time I
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
understand their concerns but I'm trying
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
to figure out how we can do this in a
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
way that doesn't
 
03:14:53.929 --> 03:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know cause a big tangle
 
03:14:57.070 --> 03:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
and using the current
 
03:14:59.809 --> 03:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
protocols that we have in place that to
 
03:15:02.809 --> 03:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
me is the cleanest way of getting to
 
03:15:02.819 --> 03:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
me is the cleanest way of getting to
where

03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:15:04.690 --> 03:15:04.700 align:start position:0%
we we
 
03:15:07.610 --> 03:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
this is the cleanest way to get TS is
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to figure out yes
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
because I'm I think this is serious
 
03:15:14.210 --> 03:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
but I think that if we notify the boards
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
that this is I mean the board that this
 
03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
is going to happen and we know I mean
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
the shop owners are part of that yes
 
03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
right yes and it's up to them because
 
03:15:24.290 --> 03:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
they own those businesses they don't
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to hire these people if
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
they don't want to yes and they'll be
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
the ones susceptible to coming before
 
03:15:30.769 --> 03:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
the board for because essentially the
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
inspection would be done on their shop
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
so if those who worked for them right
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
were causing those violations the shop
 
03:15:39.610 --> 03:15:39.620 align:start position:0%
owner also has to answer for them
 
03:15:42.230 --> 03:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
adjudication that's right so I think
 
03:15:44.809 --> 03:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to to do it
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I would also know
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
creating in good standing just generally
 
03:15:51.050 --> 03:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
thinking from an oplc point of view and
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
having rules that would define no no
 
03:15:56.030 --> 03:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
past pending or current discipline if
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
someone of that had a license with no
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
discipline on it the likelihood that
 
03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
they would then come to New Hampshire
 
03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:03.010 align:start position:0%
they would then come to New Hampshire
and

03:16:03.010 --> 03:16:03.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
engage in discipline would I think be
 
03:16:07.450 --> 03:16:07.460 align:start position:0%
far less than someone who potentially
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
has a number of failed inspections and
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
had past discipline on their license
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes just with clarification even if the
 
03:16:19.370 --> 03:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
statute passes until the rules pass the
 
03:16:20.809 --> 03:16:20.819 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't
 
03:16:22.790 --> 03:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have to Define good standing and
 
03:16:26.510 --> 03:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
rules right before we launch this off I
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of our statutes have in
 
03:16:30.230 --> 03:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
good standing and rules they don't
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily describe what it is it can
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
be used I think it would be best for the
 
03:16:37.610 --> 03:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
board to Define it in rules to make it
 
03:16:39.889 --> 03:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
clear that these are the factors they're
 
03:16:41.570 --> 03:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
looking at to put the like those
 
03:16:44.330 --> 03:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
potential licensees on notice
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay that's great thanks thank you
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
anybody uh representative
 
03:16:51.230 --> 03:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
um as a member
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
until recently of gel Carr I agree with
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
the statement that wouldn't necessarily
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
be in rules it would have to come back
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
to the board I'll State further that I
 
03:17:06.410 --> 03:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
have been opposed to
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
changing the language from substantially
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent for exactly the reason as I
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
stated in Florida I'm not ready to
 
03:17:20.210 --> 03:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
um trust the investigative powers of
 
03:17:23.050 --> 03:17:23.060 align:start position:0%
some of our other states in the union
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
to state that this person is qualified
 
03:17:28.910 --> 03:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
and whatever they say if they can fake
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
nursing certificates for heaven's sakes
 
03:17:34.010 --> 03:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
they certainly could fake cosmetology
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
certification but wouldn't that be a
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem with people that are
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
you know licensed in New Hampshire maybe
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
less of one because if they took classes
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
locally but
 
03:17:48.769 --> 03:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
um you know if they came from a state
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
that had similar requirements they which
 
03:17:53.570 --> 03:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
we would accept
 
03:17:57.889 --> 03:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
aren't we open to the same issue and
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Barry you had a question
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
hey bear sorry
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:08.269 --> 03:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
um I am in support of this bill and I
 
03:18:10.730 --> 03:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
think I was just curious at the last
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
hearing I had asked a question and I'm
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
not sure whether I had asked it of the
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor or I had asked it of olpc but I
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
was curious how many new applications
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
from out of state that you guys were
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
getting did you know that answer do you
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
know that answer or did we get that
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
answer I don't know if you got that
 
03:18:27.650 --> 03:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
answer I can check with director
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
Courtney and forcing off the top of my
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
head I do not but I can certainly get
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
that answer and email it on to you all
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
follow on
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:43.250 --> 03:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I just am curious how many
 
03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
people that we would be helping
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
bypassing this bill on an average and
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes certainly I didn't get that
 
03:18:48.960 --> 03:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
yes certainly I didn't get that
information

03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:18:54.410 --> 03:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I just note the cosmo board is
 
03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
meeting this um upcoming Monday so I'll
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
be bringing um director Courtney's
 
03:19:04.730 --> 03:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
amendment to them and so they can review
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.690 --> 03:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
any discussion or
 
03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
would you like to make a motion
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to um
 
03:19:22.490 --> 03:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment to a to amend 409
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
with the language that we provided for
 
03:19:29.690 --> 03:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
that was provided for by oplc
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
second right here
 
03:19:35.510 --> 03:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
so any
 
03:19:36.960 --> 03:19:38.210 align:start position:0%
so any
um

03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:51.530 --> 03:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
actually I guess I hadn't seen the
 
03:19:53.809 --> 03:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
actual Amendment
 
03:19:56.809 --> 03:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and it does delete the
 
03:19:56.819 --> 03:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
um and it does delete the
um

03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements being
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent
 
03:20:01.680 --> 03:20:03.050 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent
so

03:20:03.050 --> 03:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:06.050 --> 03:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I'm I object to that so
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting no okay
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
03:20:14.929 --> 03:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
if not uh representative Grotto
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative short
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
no representative a bearer yes and the
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
chair votes yes
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
um with that I will close the
 
03:20:29.090 --> 03:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on House Bill
 
03:20:40.429 --> 03:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
