00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
usually five who's the fifth one Jason
 
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
Gerhard but I'm not sure exactly what's
 
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
happening with him
 
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah he's not coming but I thought we
 
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
had somebody subbing but maybe we don't
 
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we better just get started
 
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.609 align:start position:0%
so we better just get started
yeah

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
all right um so I'd like to call the
 
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
work session to order and
 
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we're going to start with 457 so yeah
 
00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi if you wouldn't
 
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
mind joining us and just walking us
 
00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
through the new amendment that you've
 
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and subcommittee so
 
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh basically does three
 
00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 align:start position:0%
things in the first uh paragraphs there
 
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
it establishes that the treasurer shall
 
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
operate with fiduciary duty which wasn't
 
00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
in the statutes before she may have had
 
00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
that as a personal responsibility but
 
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
this as The Treasure of the state it was
 
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
not there whereas uh the pension fund
 
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.149 align:start position:0%
not there whereas uh the pension fund
system

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.050 align:start position:0%
system
um

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility to operate under
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the soul for assault interest of
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries so that's essentially the
 
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
same as a fiduciary duty maybe even
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
consider it a higher Duty so we didn't
 
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
have to amend that
 
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that this amendment
 
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
does is at the end of each of those two
 
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
uh paragraphs is adds the requirement to
 
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
make a quarterly report that that is
 
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
indeed what they're doing they're
 
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
looking at whether or not they are
 
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
performing that fiduciary duty by making
 
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
a report
 
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
um to uh the finance system and I spoke
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
with Ken Weiler uh chairman of the
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
finance committee and he said quarterly
 
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
report seems reasonable now you may say
 
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
you want it semi-annual or whatever the
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
idea is that those two organizations
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
should take a periodic look at this to
 
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that the that that
 
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility is being addressed it's
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
that simple
 
00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
great any questions yeah Peter
 
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chair so I I see uh it's
 
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
amending all after the enacting Clause
 
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
so uh so this is going to be the
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
totality of the bill that's totality of
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
the value under this amendment under
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
this amendment I do not understand why
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
some is
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
italicized and some isn't and that seems
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
odd to me but that's how what it tells
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
is you mean bolded yeah yeah that's OLS
 
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
printed it that way so I don't
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I've gone around with them a few
 
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
times on that already because it makes
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
it seem like the only thing that's
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
changing is what is bold enough how
 
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
exactly that's why I'm calling it out
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not always the case and they
 
00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
won't do it all the time which I'm sure
 
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
Peter knows but
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it's the functional arm of
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Retirement Board so the board or the
 
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs and and the and they and and
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
they supervise this board and and so
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
these folks do the actual action of
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
running the uh activity yeah the
 
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.610 align:start position:0%
running the uh activity yeah the
Investments

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah representative like us thank you uh
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
I just have a question on uh the last
 
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
sentence of the two parts on on the top
 
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
part the report shall note the existence
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
of any investment funds that may have
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
mixed rather than pure fiduciary
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
interest investment motivations I think
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty clear but the latter one
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
is the report shall note the existence
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
of any investment funds that may have
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
mixed rather than sole interest
 
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
investment motivation motivations and I
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't first of all why are they
 
00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 align:start position:0%
different and second of all
 
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely certain what the second
 
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
one is you know sole interest the first
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
one is fiduciary interest that's what we
 
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
want but I don't know Soul interest I
 
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 align:start position:0%
mean you could have a fund that invests
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
for multiple reasons but not not the
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
kind of things you're concerned about so
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
Soul interest is the term of art for
 
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty that's used with pension
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
fund operations okay it's just it's just
 
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
the terminology I thought it might be
 
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't sure yeah that's that's the
 
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 align:start position:0%
proper terminology in the pension world
 
00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.290 align:start position:0%
proper terminology in the pension world
okay

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 align:start position:0%
well we have got representative Bernardi
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well we do we have some time we've
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
got two hours actually
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
we do have one other bill but we do have
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
I see where the treasury report show
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
report the treasurer shall report
 
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.029 align:start position:0%
report the treasurer shall report
quarterly

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
in 2B
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
that was an independent investment
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
Committee of the Board of Trustees that
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
you were asking about yeah thank you
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
I haven't I haven't woken up yet I don't
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
know why
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
any any other questions for the
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
representative while we've got him
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr Bernardi
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.129 align:start position:0%
um
any

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
any concerns from the committee just off
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
the top
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
I feel like it's fairly straightforward
 
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
myself but I'd like to hear from
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
well since since this changes the bill
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
to have only these two paragraphs
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and it and and
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
includes this aspect of solely for the
 
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.490 align:start position:0%
includes this aspect of solely for the
beneficiary

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 align:start position:0%
beneficiary
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
in the interest of the beneficiaries I
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
think that's that's what certainly what
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
we want to protect that and we're not
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
it's not going off in some other
 
00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.050 align:start position:0%
it's not going off in some other
direction

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and the fact that you can have
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh possible
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
you know this ESG
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
aspect has come up with regard to some
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the things we've looked at this term
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh and there's been an opposition on the
 
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 align:start position:0%
part of some of the Republicans for sure
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's saying that they don't want that
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh but it was I think has been pointed
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
out in response that
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily harmful you can
 
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.830 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily harmful you can
have

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780 align:start position:0%
better results
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't be a complicating
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
Factor so I think that this kind of
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies things to my
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to hear if there are any
 
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:08.780 align:start position:0%
people from the
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
attenders that have I have
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
complications or problems with this
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
language because this is kind of what
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
guys any any feeling on it Chris
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
I'll go along with uh what the good
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
the quarterly report is is in addition
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
nothing I don't see anything wrong with
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
that and uh and bring in the treasury
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure that's what it was always and
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
now it's written down that it is that it
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
shall be yeah we just don't want to
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
leave loopholes for the future
 
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.949 align:start position:0%
leave loopholes for the future
foreign

00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
but that's okay I agree and um yeah I
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
concerns real concerns with the initial
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
bill and then the prior Amendment
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
um you know ESG is a for one thing it's
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
unclear exactly what it is but I mean
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
people that have those concerns could
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
look at the report if they see funds
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about they can see I
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
mean is the return
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
incomparable or better than other
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
Investments it is if it is I've got no
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
beef with it so I think this is a great
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
solution to the concerns yeah I do like
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
that there's a level of oversight from
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
the legislative body on what's going on
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
in in these different areas of
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
investment so that's my feeling on it
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
I think the quarterly aspect is
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
important because you don't want them uh
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
uh on a weekly or something like that
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
and driving them nuts but the quarter is
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
only for three months for crying out
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
loud and it had this responsibility then
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
they have to put up a shut up yep
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
um well I will
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
make a motion then
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
um to put 457 through
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
OTP to the
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
seconds to fill out the paperwork and
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
again are we expecting
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
either Downing or or
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
he's here great and Marty is is he going
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
ah yeah oh that's right for for given
 
00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:50.459 align:start position:0%
fourth they're hearing 436 right now
 
00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:51.650 align:start position:0%
fourth they're hearing 436 right now

yeah
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that makes sense okay I mean I don't
 
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.829 align:start position:0%
that makes sense okay I mean I don't
think

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need him uh
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
if you're okay with it I'll just do it
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
from here because I'll I'll have
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
yeah it's probably helpful Mr Downing
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
had one as well
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
and then we can just leave the others
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.470 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.449 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:07.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
um this amendment just for your
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
information removes the ability to roll
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
funds from the pension fund into the
 
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
funds from the pension fund into the
401a

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
I will have written remarks for the
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
told you I would great thank you good
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Craig
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
Downing I'm the executive director of
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
the Deferred Compensation Plan and the
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation commission
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer any questions on
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
H of b559
 
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.370 align:start position:0%
H of b559
um

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
that members may have I understand this
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
is a new Amendment so yeah I'll let
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
representative likes kind of talk
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
through it and then we can
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
right we can go from there
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
I'll go through the whole bill but my
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
first uh question is I understood from
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
Dan that that you had concerns with
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
people transferring for current
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
employees who are transferring from the
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
current pension system to the defined
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
contribution plan and if you could
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
we in looking at other plans that do
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
this they don't have a window of choice
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
like that as as previously written it
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
said anybody didn't give any type of
 
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.110 align:start position:0%
said anybody didn't give any type of
limits

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
limits
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
um on whether a member of group one in
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
the pension plan could transfer to the
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
DC the new DC plan
 
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.530 align:start position:0%
DC the new DC plan
um

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
states that have these plans that have
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
it as an option Florida is one
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is another they can go into
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
a pension plan or a DC plan but they
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
have a very limited window like within
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
30 to 90 days if the employee thinks as
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
a new employee they've just gotten into
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
the plan you know nope wrong one my my
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
advisor says I should be in the other
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
one then they can change but if you
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
allow an open door for essentially it
 
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.180 align:start position:0%
was written as your entire service
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
chances are moving to the DC plan after
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism approved by the IRS
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
to move that money
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
from the pension plan to the DC plan
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
we'd all it didn't say
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
contributions and interest but I would
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
assume that it would even be the
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
interest but I think after three or four
 
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.810 align:start position:0%
interest but I think after three or four
years

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
if you if somebody elects out of it
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to be behind the eight
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
ball because
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
they're they're not they'll not be able
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
to catch up also you don't want people
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
to give up by a vested benefit once they
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
go past 10 years so I I just think it
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
complicates the accounting to almost
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
unworkable between the pension system
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
and the DC plan so thank you so
 
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.550 align:start position:0%
and the DC plan so thank you so
um

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of time frames are
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
are used in I'm not going to offer
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
another amendment given the time frame
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
um but you know if maybe the Senate
 
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
could do something I could go talk to
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
them but but if we did want to allow
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
existing employees to move in if they
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
wanted what kind of a time frame would
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
not cause a problem
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
it would have to be short and and I I
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
just don't think
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I I thought you know I haven't
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
discussed anything with the pension plan
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what their IRS
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
rules are I only know my own but I mean
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
for a practical point of view
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
every state employee is on probation for
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
one year
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
so you could say they had they would
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
have one year to change but that's
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's only the the people that were
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
hired within one year of the date this
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
becomes effective so
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
I think creating a window is is not
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
really a benefit to employees that are
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the group one system if I could
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
follow yeah
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so I mean
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
if we did want to leave the option for I
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
mean there may be people who haven't
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
been in the plan for long they've been
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
in there year two year series whatever
 
00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to leave them the option of
 
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:15.949 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to leave them the option of
moving

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
first of all is is that within IRS rules
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
possible or impossible
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
and if it's possible
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
would it make sense I mean would we need
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
to make it for a limited amount of time
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
after the plan started or what what
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
could work and and if you don't know the
 
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
could work and and if you don't know the
answer

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
um that's fine but then if you could get
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
back to us because we're not going to do
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
anything today I don't think with this
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
so okay I'm happy to say that and not
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
embarrassed say I don't have the answer
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
sure I think it's possible to take that
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
money into the 457 but I'm not sure it's
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
at all possible
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
um to take that money out of the of the
 
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
pension plan that meets IRS rules uh
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
could you look at that and get back to
 
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.289 align:start position:0%
could you look at that and get back to
us

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
or I'm already get back to us or
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
whatever's appropriate
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean that's best directed to their
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
legal counsel okay but can you get in
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
touch with them I'll email them as well
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
and get it reasonably soon because
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
whenever the Senate takes us up I want
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
to be prepared and maybe there's no way
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
to do it fine
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
so I'll address the uh
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
if you're okay go through the bills so
 
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.690 align:start position:0%
if you're okay go through the bills so
um

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
again as we mentioned before this allows
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
State regular employees that means not
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
ah here he is
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
not group one and two
 
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
not group one and two
um

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
and not teachers although I think at the
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
state level there are few if any
 
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.450 align:start position:0%
state level there are few if any
teachers

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:43.460 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
Marty do you just want to
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
come up to the table if you wouldn't
 
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll you'll do all the work and
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
make it all work
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
if I can ask if yeah I can ask that
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
question okay yeah so
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I understand there were concerns
 
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.470 align:start position:0%
um I understand there were concerns
about

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the new Amendment
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
yeah great
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
um so this is the one that doesn't this
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
is the one that does not permit existing
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
employees to transfer over I have the
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
earlier one that did
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
and um so I we've heard there's some
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
concern about permitting
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
existing employees transferring over and
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
um as a non-lawyer my my general
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the way the Internal
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue code Works
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
um in the sections governing you know
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
retirement plans such as nihrs is that
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you know plan distributions are not
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
allowed while the member is still in
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
service so so that was the concern from
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
our perspective like you know if if
 
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.789 align:start position:0%
our perspective like you know if if
you're

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um you know you're 45 and you decide to
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
switch to the DC plan
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
you you haven't you haven't terminated
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
your employment so you have no right to
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
get your money out
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you know under the code
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
um could you we're not gonna you know in
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
the house we're not I think well I'm
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to propose and
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
subcommunic committee will do what it
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
will but I'm going to propose
 
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.049 align:start position:0%
will but I'm going to propose
um

00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment you have there which does
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
not permit uh people to move over
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
and it you know what I'd like you to do
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
is look into it and see if if there is a
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh and keeping the IRS happy which we
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
all want to do and if if there is I
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
might consider talking to the Senate and
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
see if they could make a change and if
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know when they're you know
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
assuming we pass this
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
but it'll probably be in a week or two
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
more well probably more than a week but
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
you could do that thank you
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
and I can go back to this okay
 
00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:07.250 align:start position:0%
and I can go back to this okay
um

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
actually I need a copy of that
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
although there's only one sentence
 
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:28.970 align:start position:0%
although there's only one sentence
difference

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
all right just a quick overview again
 
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
real quick I mean the idea is to have
 
00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.789 align:start position:0%
real quick I mean the idea is to have
new

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
um employees move you know when they if
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
the newly hired employees go into the
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
defined contribution rather than the
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan and starting out
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
this is limited to
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
um relatively small number it would be
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
state employees only not political
 
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.190 align:start position:0%
state employees only not political
subdivisions

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
and it would not be it would be a group
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
one so not police and fire permanent
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
police and fire
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it excludes teachers for some
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
reasons but there are there may be
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
there's none or very few
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
people that are employed as teachers at
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
the state level there's people with the
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
doe but they're administrators and other
 
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.930 align:start position:0%
doe but they're administrators and other
things

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
so and that the expectation is they're
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're hiring about a thousand people a
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
year in that category in that ballpark
 
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.710 align:start position:0%
year in that category in that ballpark
um

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason there's an argument I
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
mean I would argue that this is actually
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
an employee's benefit the problem is
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
that group of people
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
over half of them leave before they're
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
vested the 10-year vesting for various
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
reasons people tend to move more
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
whatever the reasons and the problem is
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
if you do that I mean you get back the
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
money you put in and a certain amount of
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
return on that
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
but you lose the employer contribution
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
and any gains on that
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
um but if if um it goes into a defined
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
contribution plan that's your money on
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
that day and you have a right to it it's
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
not going away you have them right to
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
that money and any gains on it so that's
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
arguably the biggest benefit
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if you look at
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um Dan was going to provide the data and
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
we'll try and get it at the committee
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
probably not before this afternoon but
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
if you look at every 40-year period kind
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
of a working lifespan from before the
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
Great Depression you know every year
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
after there's very few
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
where there wasn't a positive return
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
over that time period most of the time
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's a much better return
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
for so you know for
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
and that even includes going over the
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
Great Depression that period
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
because the recovery from that occurred
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you sold everything during
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
the Depression you're in trouble but if
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
you held it through that period then you
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
would have come out ahead anyway
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
and the you know the you have a
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
statutory benefit if you're in a defined
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefit plan
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
and if the return is better than that
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're not going to get
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
any of it um
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
so almost always but maybe there's no
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee but almost always it's uh
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's a better deal and there's been
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
concerns about employees not being
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
financially savvy
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
but any of these plans I've seen Mr
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
Downey could talk there's usually some
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
mutual funds that are based on someone's
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
age and they shift Investments over time
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
to less risky you get closer retirement
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
is that the case yeah correct we have a
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
suite of what they're called Target date
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
funds yes right
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
right um so you wouldn't have to know
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
anything you would never have to look at
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
it again in your whole career if you
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and it would just be they're working
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
for you so anyway that's one second Tony
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
if I could just turn that back
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
um what are the other options so you've
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
got your target date options what other
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
options do people have to invest in
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
there you said there are about 22
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
different options is that correct yes if
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
you count the target date which is uh
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
increment in every five years it's a
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
match uh when that person turns 65. if
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
you count that as one investment option
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
then we have 20 others and there's
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
there's a there's one in every
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
classification we have a stable value
 
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:06.020 align:start position:0%
fund which is protection of principal
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
that's 120 million dollars that's that's
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
a significant investment in the plan and
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
then we have a mutual fund low-cost
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
mutual funds for everything from an
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
index so we have Vanguard and Fidelity
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
index funds
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
for large cap mid cap small cap
 
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.409 align:start position:0%
for large cap mid cap small cap
International

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
International
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and and then there's sector funds
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
which are you know small cap growth
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
large cap growth so there's a full
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
there's a full menu of investment
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
options that are
 
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.169 align:start position:0%
options that are
um

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
that are reviewed on a quarterly basis
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
by our investment analysis so that we
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
have the Best in Class funds in there
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
for the participants to choose from is
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
there any assistance helping the
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
participants in choosing the options
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
that are best right for them yes
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
um outside of just paper like can they
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
actually sit down with a representative
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
yes we have three licensed financial
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
advisors that are employed by our
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
service company Empower retirement and
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
they are qualified to sit down and and
 
00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.250 align:start position:0%
they are qualified to sit down and and
help

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:09.260 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
participants if they want to go beyond
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
the target date funds and they want some
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
advice so with the target date funds uh
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
you say they switch every five years up
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
to you know marked on their 65.
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
um how do they change what what are your
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
targets like so say somebody starts
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
working for the state at 30 and their
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
first range is 30 to 35. how did those
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
kind of shift so so say that would put
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
them in the 2050 fund
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
um as they can stay in that fund But as
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
time goes by every year it gets a little
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
more conservative the mix of stocks and
 
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:49.700 align:start position:0%
bonds change slightly every single year
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
as you approach the end date of 2050. at
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
the end right now this that we have a
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's called a to and through so when you
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
get to 65 at 2050 there's a mix close to
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
50 percent of stocks and bonds that
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
continues to get more conservative as
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
time goes on and levels out to 30
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
percent of equity in the stock market
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
and 70 percent in bonds or any interest
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
bearing uh you know investment okay and
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
those are those are sponsored as we get
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
bigger I mean we're almost to the size
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
where we can do a custom Target date
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
fund but right now tubo prices are
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
provider in that and you have Target
 
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.470 align:start position:0%
provider in that and you have Target
returns

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
returns
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
in those four
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
each group oh yes yeah can you give us
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
an idea of what those look like
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I know it's tough but well yeah I
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
mean I can provide the 10-year uh
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
numbers at this at the meeting but it's
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
like 7.5 and obviously the return is
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
better on like the 2050 fund because
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
there's more equity in that rather than
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
the 20 2005 fund which is you know
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
mostly bonds which have up until
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
recently you know been very low okay so
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
but seven five percent seven point five
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
percent somewhere in that range okay
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
that's got a number of things not it's
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's a balanced approach so it's not
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hit it out of the park
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
but hopefully it's not going to Crater
 
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
price would appreciate me using that
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
word yeah you know hopefully it does
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
have some protection of loss because
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a fully Diversified fund and that
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
is our Target day if you don't if that's
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
our default fund if you don't choose on
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
your own you're automatically go into an
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh numbered a Target date
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
fund and we can do that by fed by
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
federal law because that's an
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
appropriately Diversified investment so
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
so just so that I make sure I'm
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly that the 7.5
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
percent is that on an earlier
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
gripping or is that just averaged over
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
the course of the
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
life of the investment you know
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
I just I I just looked at the
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
performance sheet yesterday I remember
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
looking at a Target date fund that I was
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
in and it was 7.5
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what that was the five
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
years or the 10-year number okay thank
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
you appreciate it
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
go ahead Tony
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
if people have questions about any of
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
this I can answer them if you want me to
 
00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.049 align:start position:0%
this I can answer them if you want me to
go

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
through the rest of it in detail I can
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
would you like the same as what it's
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
just one thing it's the same as what was
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
presented before
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
the only difference is we took out the
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
option of existing employees
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
uh transferring over because there's
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
concern about whether the IRS will allow
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
them to pull that money out of
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
the pension system while they're still
 
00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.889 align:start position:0%
the pension system while they're still
working

00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:56.889 align:start position:0%
working
representative

00:29:56.889 --> 00:29:56.899 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
147 things okay start with the start
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
with the 56th one before we go away from
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
the target date discussion so a new
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
employee comes in and says I really want
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
to roll the dice
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
much more risky investment
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
as I understand it although there's no
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
investment schedule that is listed in
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and and
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy for that I mean you would have
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
the target date as the default
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
but they could choose
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I think you would have a smaller
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
list than we currently have in the 457
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
plan but it would be like that it would
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
be index funds at a very low cost and
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's but there's people that you know
 
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:47.899 align:start position:0%
only invest in those
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
followers of vanguard's John Bogle but
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's a mid cap
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
growth fund that I was in I made 40
 
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.029 align:start position:0%
growth fund that I was in I made 40
percent

00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah I swung for the fences in that
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
fun that was the year I wished every
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
penny was in there the next year I'm
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
glad every penny wasn't in there
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
um but yeah so so they do have ability
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
to structure
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
um whether they're whether they're low
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
risk or aggressive
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just as a
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
if I was going uh whatever small cap
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
because I thought that was the
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
more more uh robust way of going as I
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
went through my career that was going to
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
be changing without me doing anything
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
about it no see that's that that's what
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
the downside is is is you know inertia
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
sets in and you set your you you may set
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
your investment as aggressive in your
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
30s and you don't change it you know
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
here you come in the 50s so that's where
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
the services provided that we pitch to
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
people and we do now so people in the
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
457 plan if they are approaching 55 and
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
they are all inequities we reach out
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
proactively to them and go hey maybe
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's time to sit down with somebody and
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that your you're
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
allocated correctly which which means
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
more Diversified
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know not be so aggressive and the
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
opposite is true people that join in
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
their 30s and they put all their money
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
in a principal account a stable value
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
fund which you know is only going to
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
give single digit interest you know
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the place for a 30 year old
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be with a 30-year or 40-year time
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
to be with a 30-year or 40-year time
frame

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
so yes so they have to be proactive
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
about it good thank you Mr Jay you're
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
very patient I'm so
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
um we're not
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
discussing it was we discussed it but
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
this bill is not this guy this amendment
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
is not discussing
 
00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:48.889 align:start position:0%
is not discussing
having

00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
employees switch plans they can't yeah
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
this one doesn't
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
um according we were just talking about
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
that yeah and and I think that's the if
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
we pass anything it'll be this one so
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to roll out of the
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
pension plan into the 401 HRA plan thank
 
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.289 align:start position:0%
pension plan into the 401 HRA plan thank
you

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
okay this is seems to be a new idea and
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me for being a little bit late
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
but I do have the question currently
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
this group one group two and we seem to
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
be creating a group three
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
correct correct yeah okay so if somebody
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
belongs to let's say group one or group
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
two ceases termination and then decides
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
to go into a an employee become an
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
employee within the group system would
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
they still be entitled to the uh
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
their benefit under the let's say in the
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
group two situation
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
so does are we going to open up the door
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
for our potential of a double dip
 
00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:56.330 align:start position:0%
for our potential of a double dip
um the

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
if a person is terminated
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
without retiring and then comes back to
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
work for the state they re-enter the uh
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
retirement system at
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
depending on their their contract
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
if they're coming back into a group two
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
position they will they would stay into
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
group two they're coming back into group
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
one position it would depend on the
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
details you see that's where I question
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
and please bear with me Madam chair uh
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
see what I'm thinking of uh within the
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
group 2 system if I somebody may want to
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
get out at you know let's say 25 years
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is allowable at this particular
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
time I mean they're too old to be a
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
copper or fine when they're hurt and
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
different things but yet they're capable
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
of doing something else and not totally
 
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
incapacitated so if the state job opened
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
up into the group three type of
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
situation uh and they decided to make
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
keep the state as a career uh
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
technically they're left in good
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
standing with the group two system they
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
met all the obligations
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
and so does that make them viable uh to
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
continue with that particular pension
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
that they have received and earned and
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
then open up the door to the group three
 
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.910 align:start position:0%
then open up the door to the group three
Marty

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
a couple of points to cover on that
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
um first to representative McGuire's
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
comment if if someone who was in group
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
one or group two left service for a few
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
years and
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um you know ended up coming back
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
applying for a job and getting hired if
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
they had kept their contributions with
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and they get hired
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
into a position that was group one in
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
group two their original hire date
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
exists if that person left employment
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
and cashed out their contributions and
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
then came back to work you know as a
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
state employee after one one of 24.
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
they'd be group three because they their
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
membership is essentially terminated
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
they you know in the retirement system
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
so you know that could go both ways
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
depending on the Member's Choice
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien your question if
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
I understood it correctly was more about
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
the the quote double dipping issue
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
someone who works a full career retires
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and collects a pension and under the
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
current RSA 100a nhrs retirees working
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a position that would have been
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
membership you know eligible would you
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
know are limited to a certain number of
 
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.050 align:start position:0%
know are limited to a certain number of
hours

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
to our reading somebody who you know
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
retires from Nashville fire and then
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
gets a job with the state at you know
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
HHS or whatever you know doing case work
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever they do
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know and they come in as a group
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
three member they would be you know a
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
group three member contributing to a
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan and they'd
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
still be getting their pension
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and the the issue with that that sort
 
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.690 align:start position:0%
um and the the issue with that that sort
of

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
construction under the current law is
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
you know if you're taking a membership
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
eligible position out of the retirement
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
system you're not getting contributions
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
on that particularly for the unfunded
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
these positions the state is still
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
paying an unfunded portion to nhrs best
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
on the covered payroll of the the group
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
three person so so the it insulates the
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
retirement system more than the the
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
classic double dip that we talk about
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
now under current law so so it's
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
because they're also not building a new
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
benefit yeah they're not accruing any
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
new benefits and the state is still
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
paying the unfunded portion on their
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
state salary to us you know it's so you
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
know it's um you know it's less of an
 
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.109 align:start position:0%
know it's um you know it's less of an
issue

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
um one thing if I I can well if I'm if
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm correct Marty it actually it would
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
actually strengthen the retirement
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
system correct because you're you're
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
putting money in towards the uaal you're
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
paying that down but at the same time
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
you're not creating a future liability
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
for the retirement system yeah it's it's
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
only yeah there's no
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
um there's no benefit downside risk on
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
accruals you know normal cost not
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
beating expectations for that person
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
because they're in the the other plan
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
but we're still getting the unfunded
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
amount to backfill right
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
um if I can just plug the mic a little
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
bit longer too yeah one one thing
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
um you know and it it may be more for if
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
it gets to the senate for an amendment
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
but you know and from the Retirement
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Systems perspective with deferred comp
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
and Treasury in admin Services being
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
sort of involved in implementing this
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
plan we're not quite sure if the
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
definitional language belongs in the
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
back of our statute ultimately or if it
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
would be better placed somewhere else as
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
long as there's a cross-reference to say
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
who's in group one in group two and
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
who's in this new group three because
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
you know the I understand sort of you
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
know the logic behind calling it group
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
three but it's not really the same
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a defined contribution
 
00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:01.579 align:start position:0%
versus a defined benefit and all of our
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
ancillary benefits for group one and
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
group two members don't Port over for
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
these folks like death and disability
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
benefits there they're not members of
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
nhrs so you know that you know it just
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
just for confusion sake you know that
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
might be something to consider
 
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.710 align:start position:0%
might be something to consider
already

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas yeah I mean um
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
you know assuming we move forward with
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
this and it goes to the house I welcome
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
any suggestions for
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
not fundamental change but rearrangement
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
of the language and then I can you know
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
with Mr Downing statute or if it needs a
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
new statute but that's you know that
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's more placement than content
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah well because there's the
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
crossover with the uaal as well so I
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
mean that is the retirement system even
 
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.770 align:start position:0%
mean that is the retirement system even
though

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying oh yeah
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
that that language you would have to
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
stay in our standard right to yeah yeah
 
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.609 align:start position:0%
stay in our standard right to yeah yeah
okay

00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Brian
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're good
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
yeah because I I think in uh Marty can
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
verify there are people that exceed
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
within the police and fire that do move
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
up within the state and take like
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
homeland security jobs and stuff like
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
that and where would they fit would they
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
come under the to group three or would
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
they remain as group two and that's
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
where my question was it would depend on
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
the position there are some Homeland
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
Security type positions that are
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative yeah I mean they
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
would still
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
be part of the group to
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
an HRS system so if they retired they'll
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
keep getting their pension if they
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
haven't retired yet Marty correct me if
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong you know they'll still they're
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
eligible for that pension when they do
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
retire so that doesn't change
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's just that they come back to a group
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
one position with the state
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
um then they would then also be able to
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
they'd also be put into the um the fine
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
contribution plan as well and they get
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
benefits from both yeah so if I'm if I'm
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
understanding everything correctly and I
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
think I am it actually adds an added
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
no no not at all I think it actually
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
adds a potential benefit for group two
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
retirees it opens up doors that weren't
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
open to them before for future
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
um investment return
 
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
under the current statute for those type
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
of positions that you you reference
 
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.630 align:start position:0%
of positions that you you reference
representative

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
um O'Brien uh membership it's a fixed
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
term appointment essentially you know
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
the governor puts a name to the council
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
and they approve it those positions
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
right now have optional membership in
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
the retirement system so someone who you
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
know retired from a municipality or even
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
from the state and there's a point of
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of those they can you know choose to
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
stay in the system you know and continue
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
to add years of service and things or
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
they can you know not do that I I think
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
under this bill anybody who begins a
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
state employee service so you know
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
depending on the
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
appointed position
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
um you know safety positions appointed
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
fixed terms those are considered group
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
two still you know if it's a you know
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education or whatever
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's an employee so you know
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
but so I don't know I think the DC would
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
they'd have the option for the DC they
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the option for nhrs
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
anymore but those people who are a group
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
in group two or group you know in moving
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
into the state in an appointed fixed
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
term position that that's also grouped
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
too they can stay in the system or they
 
00:42:45.849 --> 00:42:45.859 align:start position:0%
can not
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back to representative
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
so you can
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I mean if you're okay and just I'll
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
address if there's any other questions
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
sure any other specific questions for
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
and this amendment does replace the
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
whole bill so it's the bill so it's the
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
bill it's off yeah
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.109 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:15.370 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
it does so basically basically what this
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
is doing is it is creating a a new
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
retirement plan okay so maybe it's not a
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
new group in the retirement system that
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
is a new retirement plan and any state
 
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:42.020 align:start position:0%
employees that are hired after July 1
 
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
2024 that would have been in group one
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh so not teachers or any anybody like
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
that but just state employees
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
um would not would no longer be put into
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
group one of the retirement plan that
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
would be put into a defined contribution
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
plan so they would be putting in seven
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
percent of their own money and then the
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
employer just like they do now in group
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
one would add at this point it's 2.8
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
percent or thereabout so 9.8 percent
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know essentially of their salary
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
in totality would go into a defined
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
contribution plan into one of the plans
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
that would be available to them and then
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
that that would either accumulate or not
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
we assume would accumulate
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
um until their retirement and then they
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
would have those funds available to them
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
at retirement they wouldn't get a
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
defined benefit so I'll just give an
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
example uh because that might help
 
00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:34.099 align:start position:0%
let's say the final average compensation
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
for a state worker was sixty thousand
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
dollars you do the calculation it comes
 
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
out to sixty thousand dollars and
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
they've worked for 30 years all right
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to get 50 percent of their
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
benefit at that point if I'm not
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
mistaken so they would get a thirty
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a year benefit from the
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the benefit to them would be if we
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
move them to a defined contribution plan
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
would depend on the returns and that's
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I asked what the
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
general return was for the stage plan
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
um let's say it was 6.75 percent because
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's the target range for the
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system it's not apples for
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
apples but it's the best that we can do
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
if they were if if a state employee who
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
made sixty thousand dollars was
 
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.569 align:start position:0%
made sixty thousand dollars was
investing

00:45:22.569 --> 00:45:22.579 align:start position:0%
investing
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
that um seven percent of their salary
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
plus 2.8 percent from their employer and
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
they did that every year for 30 years
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay by that time they were in their 90s
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'd say that stayed consistent they
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
would have been able to withdraw thirty
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year just like they
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
would have through their pension but
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
they would have over a million dollars
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
in savings and that number shifts
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
obviously depending on the returns if
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
the returns are higher they'll have more
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
money if the returns are lower they'll
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
have less money there does reach a point
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
obviously I think it's about five
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
percent where
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
you know they could potentially
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
not get the same benefit that they would
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
get out of the defined country the fine
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
benefit plan but it's so complicated
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
because every case is different every
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
employee is different every you know
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
every plan is different it really just
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
depends on what people choose so there's
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of potential outcomes
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but this certainly gives the employee
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
a much larger upshot than what we have
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I guess the last thing that I will
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
say and then I'll open it up for other
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
comment is I believe what we're trying
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
to do with these particular kinds of
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
bills is we're trying to balance a few
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
different things first is who has
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
exposure to risk so in a defined benefit
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
plan the exposure to risk is completely
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the employer it's completely on the
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if we miss our Target
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
investment rate of 6.7 percent our
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
employer rates go up to compensate
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
because we've
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
promised a benefit and we have to meet
 
00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:49.339 align:start position:0%
that benefit
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
in a defined contribution plan the risk
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
is on the employee if we don't hit that
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
6.75 percent the employee makes less
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
money the state
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to go back to the
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to fill that Gap however we're
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
also balancing the reward in a defined
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
benefit plan if the retirement plan hits
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
24 in a year
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
that doesn't bump your benefit at all in
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
a defined contribution plan you could
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
stand to make a whole lot of money and
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
you get to keep that money so we're
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
balancing the the risk versus the reward
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh if you're absorbing the risk you're
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
getting the reward and if not then you
 
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.809 align:start position:0%
getting the reward and if not then you
don't

00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um so like I said it's a it's a
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
definitely an intriguing plan but that's
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
the from my understanding
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
um that's the general scope of it does
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comments or question
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGuire yes thank you
 
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.890 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGuire yes thank you
Mr

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
ID of the employee has no longevity risk
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
they will get their pension as long as
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
they live however they bear the
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
inflation risk where the value of their
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
pension is eroded over time and that is
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
entirely borne by the employee
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
if you have a defined contribution plan
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
you can you have much less of an
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
inflation risk because you don't your
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
benefit is not set you can change it
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
with inflation when uh for the most part
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
returns are higher
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
so but you do have the longevity list
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
risk in that if you happen to be so
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
fortunate to live to 110 you might run
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
out of money
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
but that's something that
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh people can balance them actually if I
 
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.510 align:start position:0%
uh people can balance them actually if I
can

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead you actually have a an option
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
on when you retire on how to handle that
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
I did that with part of my money you you
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
take you could take summer all of the
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
money in there
 
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
and roll it over into an uh Ira based
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
annuity so they'll guarantee you if you
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
want to if you want the thing where you
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
want a guarantee of a certain amount
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
every month for the rest of your life
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and but you're willing to absorb the
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
inflation risk you can put it into
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
annuity and you know with a major
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
insurance company and they will pay you
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
that amount of money
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
as long and you can have your spouse
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
included which will get you a lesser one
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
but but it'll pay it out just like the
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
pension system would I think there's
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
there are even ones where they'll
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
provide some inflation protection but
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
then the monthly amount you're going to
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
get is quite a bit less because they're
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
taking that risk but there there are
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
options and if you're you're really
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
concerned about outliving the money
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's things you can do but as Matt
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
said in most cases you know if there's
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
reasonably good returns you're still
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
going to be able to take out the same
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
amount your pension would and you know
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
you could you could live almost
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and you're still going to
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
have money left in the end especially if
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
you're taking out yeah I mean because I
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
was I was basing my initial projections
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
on 6.75 and testimony today was that it
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
could be 7.5 percent or at least it has
 
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.410 align:start position:0%
could be 7.5 percent or at least it has
been

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
um which would would land you with even
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
more money I would just like to add to
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
what representative McGuire said
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you do bear the inflation risk unless
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
as we just did with group two you
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
introduced Cola and then that that can
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
be borne by the employer that can be
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
born by the taxpayer as well and my
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
concern with that was that group two
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
pensions tend to be larger than most
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
other pensions and when we're looking at
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
people who have been retired for 10 or
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
more years
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
um during a time where it was arguably
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
the easiest to accrue the largest the
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
larger pensions
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
um we found we still find it necessary
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
to backfill some of that with colas
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
because the benefit itself doesn't prove
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
to be big enough over the long term to
 
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:55.220 align:start position:0%
meet the need of the employee
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
so it is possible although yes in theory
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
most of the burden is borne by the
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
employee because of the of inflation it
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
can flow back to the employer if and the
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if a cola comes up
 
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if a cola comes up
so

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
I need to contest that if I may I've
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
been out
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
maybe closer to eight years and I have
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
yet to receive a cola oh I just said Ken
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't say will right yeah
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
the thing is I mean if you look at
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
Social Security if you love Uncle Sammy
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
and you know God Bless America and all
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
that they do at times come up with
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
Social Security and do increase the
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
Social Security benefits which they have
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
just done recently but unfortunately
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
what the callers is a different thing it
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
seems to be a matter of choice of this
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
body whether they want to fund a caller
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
or not that is exactly the case and
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
whether it's fair or not we can most
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
certainly I could tie you up for a
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
couple hours on that one but I'll leave
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
it alone yeah we won't go too deep into
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
it but the thing is uh it's just to
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
paint it with the big brush to say I I
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair I think people I
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
do suffer because of it oh no I agree
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
and it has been and I think if Monica
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
tells that colas have been an adopted
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
part of the uh defined benefit system
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
for a very long time uh it's been a
 
00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
solution that has been resolved by nhrs
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the employees for I don't know how
 
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:30.740 align:start position:0%
many years
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's just falling off the radar as a
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
blade just just for clarification
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Brian I wasn't I wasn't
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
saying who was I was simply saying that
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's possible that it can if a cola is
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep up with inflation so
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
yes the employee is burying the burden
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
of the inflation in a pension plan
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't increase with with
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
that so if we want to compensate for
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
that we have to bring in a cola the
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't bear the burden of the
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
cola expense the taxpayer would not
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
saying we are or we are not doing that
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
or will or will not doing that just
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
philosophically speaking that's how it
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
would work right because with the
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
defined benefit what they have is they
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
have like what they figure is the travel
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
he is when somebody retires that you
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
know but that doesn't last forever I
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
mean you know like everybody well just
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
if I can stop the feature of
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's the risk and that's what
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're balancing right with this
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
conversation that's what we're balancing
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
is it's just because you're getting a
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
defined benefit doesn't mean that you're
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
good like for the rest of your life
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
because of inflation you can still find
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
yourself in a shortfall in your budget I
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
know my shop personally I have a decomp
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
plan myself and that's yeah that's
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
Michael parachute
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think one way of looking at it
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
is um you know for the defined benefit
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
plan a person that plan is bearing two
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
risks one is the inflation risk and one
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
is political risk which is what's going
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
to happen around Cola right so there's
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
that and the other thing you talk about
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
the travel years
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
I mean if somebody wants to in a defined
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
con Define contribution plan if for
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
let's say a few years after they retire
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
they want to take more money out because
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
they want to do traveling while they're
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
still physically able to and then they
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
they cut back on their expenses after
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
that that is an option you have a lot of
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
options or you could take part of it
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know buy an annuity that it's
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to give you money as long as you
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
live and maybe spend some of the others
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
to do something up front which might be
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
travel or whatever so I mean it's more
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
flexible you have more options
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
I mean you you know so that's the other
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
thing I think to keep in mind with this
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
particular plan is that the employee is
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
in is vested
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
from the day they start making
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
contributions so they don't have to wait
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
10 years like they would typically in
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
the retirement system to be guaranteed a
 
00:54:49.089 --> 00:54:49.099 align:start position:0%
future benefit
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
their the money the employee and
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
employer money is theirs from day one
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if they move on they can take that
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
with them from day one
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
um unlike if they're in the benefit
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
program so I mean that and Marty you can
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
actually speak to this
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
um because 50 of the employees leave
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
before vesting there is some level of
 
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
money that the state is holding on to
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
that the state wouldn't be holding on to
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
because it would be going with the
 
00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:17.540 align:start position:0%
employee right away do we have any idea
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
what kind of money that would be
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'm not sure if it's 50 or not
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of the turnover but but to the
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
extent that when someone leaves with
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
less than 10 years of service it's it's
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
true that the employer contributions
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
stay in the trust fund
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
um if somebody leaves in less than six
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
months those are refunded to the
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
employer but you know if it's a you know
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
an immediate washout
 
00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:45.740 align:start position:0%
um so so there is you know so that's
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
less money charged on the rate for the
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
for the employers who keep going so it
 
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:52.700 align:start position:0%
does you know it is it is
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the pension plan but I I
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
don't have a I I'll see if we have any I
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
don't think we we have a
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
ever had a breakdown of the mem the
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
non-vested member employer contributions
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
on behalf of non-invested members
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
because that the employer contributions
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
aren't assigned to individuals when
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
they're reported to us you know the
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
member contributions are assigned to you
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
know you you and you so if we need to
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
refund them to to you or your
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
beneficiary we can do that but the
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
employer you know National cuts a check
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
for everybody and it's the same check
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
and it you know goes into the state
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund that way so I'm not sure if
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
we can tease out
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable to assume
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's a dangerous question
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can tell me if it is but it would be
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable to assume that deposits for
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
the uaal from group three members going
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
into the system without any future
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
liability for a benefit would compensate
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
for the funds that would be lost because
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
the employees are taking it with them it
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
it would to a great extent do that that
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's based on a conversation we had
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
with the actuary not a report or
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
anything but that
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's coming in is is
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
almost you know unanticipated Revenue
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded over and above you
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
know plan costs going forward because
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
the folks aren't members so so it it to
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
a great extent that would
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
um cover cover that but I don't have a
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
percentage to what that extent is
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah representative like us so
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
so just one comment on that to the
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
extent it doesn't cover it uh well
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
people may have noticed I tend to be
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
kind of frugal I think uh being happy
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and wanting to take advantage of the of
 
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.589 align:start position:0%
and wanting to take advantage of the of
people

00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know losing the employer
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
contributions just because for some
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
reason they left early is not something
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with so yeah no no I was
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
saying I figure out is whether or not
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
it was it was mostly a win for everybody
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
by the way that it was structured
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
because the employee is going to get the
 
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
money but even if it's a little bit of a
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
a loss
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
um I think that's reasonable instead of
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
putting you know putting people in a
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
position where I believe it's over uh
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
Dan had some numbers from somebody but I
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's something over 50 percent
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
leave before 10 years and if that's true
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
then over half the people are losing
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
money that should be you know would have
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
been for the retirement whereas with the
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
part of the benefit of the defined
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
contribution plan is they get to keep
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
that even if they leave and that is the
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
goal of the program yes the goal of the
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
program is to get the employee money so
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
I want to come back to something that
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
Tony said a while back
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
because I had a question in my mind and
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you spoke to it the number of people
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
were talking about would be getting into
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
this kind of a situation situation and I
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
think you said you had guesstimated or
 
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:00.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know quite
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
consciously kind of tried to calculate
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
it uh about a thousand people
 
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh Dan actually I'm not sure who
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
he talked to maybe somebody
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
you know yeah yes the department of
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
personnel yeah they they they they add
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
they hire about a thousand people a year
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
part of that's maybe new positions Parts
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know turnover but still those new
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
people then become eligible for group
 
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.710 align:start position:0%
people then become eligible for group
three

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr before I wander offensive
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
those proverbial weeds is uh
 
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
representative through with his analysis
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
of and this thing is not like the other
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
and unless you have questions yeah he's
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
covered the things that are different
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
from what we what the previous bills had
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
um maybe a general question to uh people
 
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
that are here
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to retire
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
and then come back and become a group
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
are they still subject to the hours
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the way we would view it with nhrs is
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that's no longer an nhrs membership
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
required position so so they wouldn't be
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
subject to it because they're not it's
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
not in any risk an HRS position anymore
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's something else outside the
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system so a firefighter can
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
retire go become a plow driver
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
and get the full
 
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:34.099 align:start position:0%
benefit of the group three yeah system
 
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:37.339 align:start position:0%
and and be allowed to take their pension
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think the question you are going
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
toward is and be allowed to work full
 
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
time if they wanted yes and they would
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
be there if you know our research they
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
could not they could not correct I think
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
the next question I have will be in two

helpful yes yeah well you're not invited
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
to speak it in 45 unless we have
 
01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:37.250 align:start position:0%
to speak it in 45 unless we have
questions

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
on uh 100 a 67
 
01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:44.450 align:start position:0%
on uh 100 a 67
um

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
number Roman two and three
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh page three line 34 yes
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
so I understand what what the uh
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is trying to do uh after a
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
quick review Yesterday by our outside
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
playing Council he said actually
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
bringing out the terms of how
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
the the plan is this the employer is not
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
liable like he said at The Prudent
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
investment standard has been met
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
well the commission could do everything
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
possible that they think is meets The
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
Prudent investment standard but as you
 
01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
know if you have two lawyers in a room
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
you have three opinions
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
so I he thinks that actually opens up a
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
risk for the employer and it's rather to
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
be silent on it both to and there are
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
three are there other laws already in
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
place that would protect an investor
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
another fraud related or well it
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't yeah I mean assuming assuming
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
the fraud was
 
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.130 align:start position:0%
the fraud was
involved

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean fraud is I mean by the by
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
the commission and choosing the
 
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.450 align:start position:0%
the commission and choosing the
investment

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out what the
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
what the options would be that wouldn't
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
allow you to well well we would have in
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
the planned document for the 401a just
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
like we have in the document for the 47
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
we would have The Prudent investment
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
rule so we have to do that already right
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
but if if somebody said well you
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been in this fund rather
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
than this fund
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
it goes before a judge the judge may say
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
well your own statute says if it doesn't
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
meet The Prudent investment rule you're
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
on the hook
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGuire doesn't Roman
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
3 on the next page
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
investment loss that results from
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
participants directing the investment of
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
plan assets
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
so if they make a poor asset allocation
 
01:03:58.849 --> 01:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook as long as the fund
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
they invested in is not fraudulent or
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
irresponsible or something only if
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
you're directly responsible for picking
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
the fund and
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.309 align:start position:0%
if you are
decided

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
decided
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
going all all into aggressive stock
 
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.849 align:start position:0%
going all all into aggressive stock
funds

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:18.710 align:start position:0%
funds
the

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
the plan is not liable for that decision
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
if as long as they have chosen an
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
aggressive stock fund that is
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
so identified and has minimal fees just
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
just for clarification what you're
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
saying is that
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
the administration wouldn't have the
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
ability to invest without
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
the participant directing it so this
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
covers everybody is that what you're
 
01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
covers everybody is that what you're
saying

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
reasonable their asset allocation is not
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
your is not your fault
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's what I think Roman 3 says
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
Tony and then I mean and you know I
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
guess I mean it would it to be
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
responsible and have to be something
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
like offering Joe's Ponzi scheme fund or
 
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
like offering Joe's Ponzi scheme fund or
something

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Downing
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's a Deferred Compensation Plan
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
that talks about annuities and only that
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
I I think maybe we I could we could
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
leave three I would still say take two
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
out I think that that is that that opens
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
you up
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
we would run the plan on the on the
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
prudent fiduciary rule prudent
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
investment rule I mean that's going to
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
be the Bedrock if I could ask do you
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
want to remove all of two or the part
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know after you know if the prude
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
investment standard has been met part
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
I I think I think if we may tweak we may
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
offer a tweak for three
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
um and I'll try to get an answer on that
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
before 1 45. well no we're not we're I
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
think what the options are at this point
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
in the schedule is
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
um you know either the sub either the
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
full committee will adopt this amendment
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
okay and do out to otpa on the bill or
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
not as they choose and the whole house
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
will pass it or not as they choose the
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
only option to make a change would be
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
then to go to the Senate and say well
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little cleanup that we'd like
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
and and that'll be um I'll just I'll
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
just bring it as a concern okay
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
you said you had a couple was there yeah
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
is there another one
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
um I would there are two things on uh
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
on here on the fourth page we now have
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
for these people that would be hired
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
right now if you're hired your
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
retirement age is 65.
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have uh so if you want
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
a post retirement benefits you have to
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
work till 65.
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
I could uh leave now I just turned 64
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I would get full benefits under the
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
rules but I don't believe that um
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
now yes the secure found a secure Act
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
made eligible you could take your
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
benefits out at 59 and a half I think
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the concerns of making a plan that's
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
good for retirement that you should not
 
01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
allow this it's an optional uh the
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
federal government is optional we have
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
decided at the Deferred Compensation
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
Plan we're not going to entertain that
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to let people out 59
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
um they have they they get out when they
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh they can access their money when they
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
turn 70 and a half or when they leave
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
State service so it would be my
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation at somewhere in the point
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
that you do not allow them to take out
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
money at 59 and a half
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
so that I mean if we want would that
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
would be just removing three or changing
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
moves I wouldn't move three that would
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
take care of it we were concerned
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
um and then we would have to see on 13
 
01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:05.650 align:start position:0%
um and then we would have to see on 13
whether

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:05.660 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
hardship rules apply right now hardship
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
rules don't apply to the pension
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
I mean you can't take money out of the
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
pension period unless you've got a
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
disability or you die or you retire but
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
that that is just uh you know my hand up
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
on that is we'd have to see if the 401a
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
regulations would let us do that okay
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
although it does say as limited by
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
federal regulations so okay and that may
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
and that is limited by the rules of the
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
plan and the Federal Regulations both so
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
so yeah the planned document would we
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
could address that in the plan document
 
01:08:53.699 --> 01:08:55.550 align:start position:0%
could address that in the plan document
okay

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
was there anything else no thank you
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Schmidt
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so one of the things
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
that we have not uh really discussed uh
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
which uh I would like to have at least
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
raised uh for the group to consider or
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
at least to respond to in some fashion
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that is that a number of the private
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
pension plans uh have gone belly up uh
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
over the years I the name Eastern
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
Airlines comes immediately to mind uh
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
and the where the court basically said
 
01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:34.370 align:start position:0%
and the where the court basically said
hey

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
life is tough right and and uh uh where
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
I think that the state plans uh uh they
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
are kind of on the hooks that none of
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
the state plans have gone uh well we
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten that response to my
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge so I'd like to raise the issue
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
and have some discussion on it I see I
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
think I can and you can folks can
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I think those
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
were pension plans to find benefit
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
pension plans and went Belly Up
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
but this is a defined contribution plan
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
the money's put in each pay period at
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
that point that's the property of the
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
employee and there's nothing the state
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
could do to make that go away and that's
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
also another important benefit
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a different Beast than the ones
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
that ran into those troubles
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
in fact the plan that they're in now
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be closer to right I'm glad I
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
raised the issue because I think we
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
ought to have talked about it or thought
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
about it and know the answer so thank
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Brown yeah it's just uh
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
again it's probably mitoticness and
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
please excuse me with this uh I was
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
always taught you know whenever you put
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
money in the bank as you take two
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
nickels put in the bank let them rub
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
together and maybe it makes 25 cents
 
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:01.100 align:start position:0%
eventually uh does this take away from
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh the group one group two pension
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
system so the capability of making money
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
by creating this third system uh will
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
there be some hidden penalty with this
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
as we go down the road I mean to me the
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
more people that are in the group one
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
group two system makes it healthy
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
just seems counter-intuitive Mr Carlin
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
any input on that
 
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.930 align:start position:0%
any input on that
yeah

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
um in the original original original
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
version of of this bill
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the group one employee
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
population would be declining it would
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
have put pressure on our investment
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
allocation and on funding
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
um the inclusion in a subsequent
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the state paying the
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability portion on the salary
 
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
of these non-members has
 
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
um sort of taken our primary concern off
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
the board in terms of setting up this
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
plan because that allows nhrs to
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know maintain its current operations
 
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
because we're getting this Revenue
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
stream on the non-members so so that
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
that that that sort of
 
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
that would have been our primary concern
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know with the original public
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
hearing if there was an already
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
amendment by then
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
um type of thing so yeah so it
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:25.940 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
your concern would have been
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
valid under the old
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
playing under the original language but
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
this insulates the retirement system to
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
some extent so to a great extent of that
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and can I mention the lrl offension in a
 
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
and can I mention the lrl offension in a
room

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
eventually if we get in the hope of 2039
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
which I don't think it's going to happen
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
but with the UL u-a-l-l it would be
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
let's say that's the target date to have
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
it maxed out okay and have it taken care
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
of at that particular time could the
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
group one group two system be open to
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
something like this uh unmandated to the
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
group one and two employees and if that
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
happened I think you're going to have a
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know the current system for all of a
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
group one in groups who could could be
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
changed now there there is an additional
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
cost to that though in the sense of
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
closing the defined benefit plan
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
entirely means at some point you know
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
the active members are going to age into
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
retirement and all we are is paying
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
benefits for the lifetime of tens of
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
thousands of people so you can invest in
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
the stock market or any you know you you
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to have extremely conservative
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
interest bearing Investments at that
 
01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:46.370 align:start position:0%
interest bearing Investments at that
point

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so your assume rate of return would
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
continue to go down over time and that
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
would raise employer contributions on
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
the active population going forward so
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
that that's that's one of the reasons
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
that the defined contribution bills were
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
proposed probably seven eight years in a
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
row between the late 2000s and the mid
 
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.130 align:start position:0%
row between the late 2000s and the mid
teens

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
teens
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
um you know but that that sort of
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
transitioning cost of a of a closed plan
 
01:14:13.689 --> 01:14:13.699 align:start position:0%
with a shrinking Act of the population
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
put significant cost pressure you know
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
on on on that transition if if we were
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
at a situation where the plan was fully
 
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.630 align:start position:0%
at a situation where the plan was fully
funded

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
you know on Tuesday
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know in the State closed it you know
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
that transition piece would go away and
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
it would be easier legislatively because
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the cost issue would be removed to
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
close nhrs on the day where you know 101
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
funded and say thank you and move on
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's it's we're talking a
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
lot of hypotheticals here but that's
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
some of the backs story of why it hasn't
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
happened plan wide you know in other
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
years and what you know could happen
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
going forward it's it's always easier to
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
tweak your plan when you're close fully
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
funded or close to full funded and so
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
some states that have made transitions
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
um one one it was sort of about 10 years
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
ago I think Utah created a defined
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
contribution they still have the option
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the new new entrants could pick DB or
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
DC but they were like 95 funded when
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
they did that so the the
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the the setup costs and the uh you know
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
the burdens on the unfunded weren't
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
nearly what we'd see in New Hampshire
 
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
well and the only other parts of that
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
too would be depending on whether 436
 
01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
goes through and becomes law you have
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
that three-year
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
um you can't change the plan after three
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
years worth of service so it depends on
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
whether that goes through that might be
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
a bit of a handcuff on future
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislatures to change to a DC plan from
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
at least from a group to perspective
 
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:48.860 align:start position:0%
I I think as you know representative
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
Simon my
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
career was 200 over 200 years of
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
tradition not affected by progress so
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know very good yeah Tony go for it
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you two comments one is um
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
the reason the original draft didn't
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
take it didn't include paying the uaal
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
is because we got the draft the morning
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
of the deadline on the 28th out of OLS I
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
quickly caught that it would have been a
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
redraft it was too late for redress we
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
had to do an amendment so that that was
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
um you know OLS didn't include that but
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
as soon as I saw it it's like no this
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
cannot work you know we have to fix that
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what happened there
 
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.350 align:start position:0%
so that's what happened there
um

01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is there is the
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
problem with this overhang of the uaal
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
that makes a conversion difficult and
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's part of why you know we're
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
starting small just the state uh group
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
one non-teacher employees
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
and future legislation legislators can
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
legislations can go and and decide
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
um to add more if they want in the
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
future and maybe as ual gets paid down
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
they'll have more flexibility to do it
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
they might decide it's a good idea or
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
not but that's for the future
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
see that would increase my level of
 
01:17:05.649 --> 01:17:05.659 align:start position:0%
comfort if we had something that
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
sanctifies the group one in group two
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
without the potential of looking into
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
this in the future we can't bind future
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
legislations legislatures and right but
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
right now it's yeah one thing is that as
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
long as we have the uaal hanging over
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
our heads which will be another uh 17
 
01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.310 align:start position:0%
our heads which will be another uh 17
years

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
most of it then
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
the cost of taking of stopping new
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
people entering into the retirement
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
system is going to be very high
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we have to pay down the uaal
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
to do much of anything to be honest with
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
you and I would add to that
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
representation well that's why I I
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
believe a healthy system is you know
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
something that's north of 85 percent you
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
know you can't screw with it I I would
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
hope that as the uaal comes down
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
and the employer contributions come down
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have in statute that the employer
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
contributions cannot be less than the
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
total implore contribution cannot be
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
less than the employee contributions and
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
once the uals is coming down right now
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
the employees are paying the bulk of
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
their current pensions and that I hope
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be balanced if
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
much more evenly and fairly than it is
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would add
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative Brian is If This Were to
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
go into a fact
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
by the time we get to that point we
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
would have over a decade's worth of
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
information to look at and I would
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
I should never assume but a future
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislature would look at the results of
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
that and use that to a certain extent to
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it would be in
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
the best interest of those future
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
employees to change over as the employee
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
going to get a better benefit than the
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
one that they have so they would have
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
some information to look at in making
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that decision they wouldn't whereas you
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
know I mean they can do that anyway I
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
mean even if we don't pass this
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that 12 years from now A legislature
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
could look at it and make that change
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
Whole Hog one two everybody all at once
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
they have the power to do that
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I understand in my lifetime in the
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
pension system I'm sure Marty would
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
agree I lived none of the opinion and
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
what happened you were misinformed
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's another aspect of that's the
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
other risk that's another aspect of
 
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
political risk yeah exactly bad decision
 
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.410 align:start position:0%
political risk yeah exactly bad decision
making

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.450 align:start position:0%
making
yeah

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
Christopher only had like five he said
 
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
Christopher only had like five he said
147.

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
147.
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
you're saving them now listen this is it
 
01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.709 align:start position:0%
you're saving them now listen this is it
man

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
man
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay well I offered to answer them so
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll get questions over the course
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
of the summer I don't know
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you gentlemen I
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your input it was invaluable
 
01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:08.990 align:start position:0%
appreciate your input it was invaluable
help

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.890 align:start position:0%
help
um

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's just grab
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
maybe five minutes take a break
 
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
um and we'll come back just get up
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
stretch your legs a little bit and we'll
 
01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
um I have heard many things this morning
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
relating to a defined contribution plan
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
about these employees are going to make
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds of money
 
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.330 align:start position:0%
all kinds of money
Maybe

01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.669 align:start position:0%
Maybe
Maybe

01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
um you please cannot forget the facts
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we have before us and that are
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
the 10 worst years
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the stock market has had in its
 
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.490 align:start position:0%
that the stock market has had in its
history

01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
four of them happened in this Century in
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
the last 22 years
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay what this bill is designed to do is
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
to allow a a 401k essentially Define
 
01:39:14.639 --> 01:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
to allow a a 401k essentially Define
contribution

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
um where it's it's it's fragile is there
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make money of course
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
is there an opportunity to lose a ton of
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
money absolutely and we're talking about
 
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
the retirement security of our state
 
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:35.870 align:start position:0%
the retirement security of our state
employees

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not willing to risk that and I hope
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
you're not either
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know just just for clarification
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I I understand that a hundred percent
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that you're making but
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
those concerns apply to any program I
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
mean if the if the pension plan goes in
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
the toilet we're in the same kind of
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
scenario it's not like we're free and
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
clear somebody's going to have to pick
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
up that tab somebody assumes the risk of
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
that and sure ultimately the taxpayer
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
does so I mean as far as I would just
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
push back a little bit on the testimony
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that we were insinuating were just
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to Foxwoods
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
um we're not we're investing in the same
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
kind of vehicles that the pension plan
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
invests in as a general rule and those
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
two systems will probably move fairly
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
well up or down together and absorb the
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
same kinds of risks so if we're going to
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
Foxwoods for a defined contributions
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
that we're also going to Foxwoods for
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit plan well the
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
difference being this representative is
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
that in those down years
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay under defined benefit I'm still
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
getting the same benefit
 
01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:48.659 align:start position:0%
right in the down no I agree I was just
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
pushing back on that yeah well I'm
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
pushing back a little bit myself yeah
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
all right because that's that's that's
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
the facts of that
 
01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.090 align:start position:0%
the facts of that
um

01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's concerning to me on this new
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
group three
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
I don't see any connection
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
to a disability retirement
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
right now if you're a D.O.T worker okay
 
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
working on our our roads
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a retirement
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
disability benefit
 
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't see that associated with group
 
01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.930 align:start position:0%
I don't see that associated with group
three

01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
I would invite all you to go over to dot
 
01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.629 align:start position:0%
I would invite all you to go over to dot
Memorial

01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see a death benefit
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
Associated here for for group three
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
employees there's a lot of things that
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
that just have not been considered in
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
this bill as I told you on February 22nd
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
I ask you to pause
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of things in here
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
that um excuse me there's a lot of
 
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:53.900 align:start position:0%
things that aren't in here
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
that are concerning that they're not
 
01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:57.709 align:start position:0%
that are concerning that they're not
there

01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:41:59.810 --> 01:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
not having a a disability benefit once I
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
I will let you continue to talk for sure
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
I just know Tony's time is short and
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
he's gonna have to leave in a second go
 
01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
ahead Tony right
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points one is
 
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.850 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points one is
um

01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
so the the disability I mean you have
 
01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
still the money available that's in the
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
retirement plan and if there's serious
 
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
health problems that money can be used
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
there's also SSI I mean if you're if
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're disabled that's available to you
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh the Social Security disability
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um the talking about the 10 worst years
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
is is a problem because people's working
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
career is generally longer than that
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
even if they move between employers
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
still if they're in a defined benefit
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
plan they can move in and take them with
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
them and you have to look more over 40
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
years with a working career and you
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
could look at there are there's maybe a
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
handful of that period 40-year periods
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
from before the Great Depression until
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
currently you can try every other year
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
where P where the return was not uh
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
reasonably good
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is uh let's see what
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
else other points I find the Foxwoods
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
analogy offensive uh because that's uh
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's talking about
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
investing in the stock market and the
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
bond market comparing it to gambling and
 
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you the rate of return on on
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
the markets is a lot better than you're
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
going to get at Foxwoods at least on
 
01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:24.109 align:start position:0%
going to get at Foxwoods at least on
average

01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
um and the other one last thing I'm
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to point out and that is
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the taxpayers who
 
01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:32.219 align:start position:0%
are paying these people are in defined
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
benefit plans
 
01:43:36.609 --> 01:43:36.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to find contribution plans
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
401K IRA and the like
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
and you know good enough for them good
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
enough for the state employees in my
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
view so
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
well I would respond to that
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative first and foremost um
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
the Foxwood analogy was in no way meant
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
to be offensive it was my way of of
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
expressing that all I heard this morning
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
was how wonderful this defined
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
contribution was was going to be without
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
any discussion about really potential
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
downsides with down years in the stock
 
01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.649 align:start position:0%
downsides with down years in the stock
market

01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's my analogy that
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
all I'm hearing is oh this is going to
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
be this will be a wonderful thing it's
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's that hope of of it's going to be
 
01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.649 align:start position:0%
it's that hope of of it's going to be
great

01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
um I think we all know we've all
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
experienced those those down years and
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a real concern in terms
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
of you know when we're recruiting and
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're trying to retain as you all know
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
right now we have a deferred comp plan
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's that that's voluntary on top of a
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is a wonderful recruiting tool
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
that all goes away under this bill
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
and still I will just say just just in
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
itself that there's no that there's that
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's no disability retirement offered
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
in group three
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you please this should be a
 
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
great pause to you
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
because there hasn't been enough thought
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt I
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah you got to do jcec that's fine we
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
understand we'll see you have we'll see
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative O'Brien
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
I really do appreciate that sorry for
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
the interruption again oh that's that's
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess certainly you know the
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
the question about
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal do we have an updated
 
01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:42.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
and is it obviously you can't go to a
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
second committee at this point but again
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
that should bring real pause we're
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
talking about millions of dollars here
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
according to the February 10th fiscal
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
note that's the only one that that's the
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
most updated version that I have
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
the cost shifting cost shifting nobody's
 
01:46:05.209 --> 01:46:05.219 align:start position:0%
talking about cost shifting okay to find
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
benefits for the rest of your life
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
Define contribution can be cannibalized
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay when that gets cannibalized we
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
talked about inflation earlier
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay where do those people go they go
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
back to the state cost shifting
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
nobody's talking about that there's
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
nothing in here to address cost shifting
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
well and that once again I would just
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
say could potentially go both ways
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
because if the if the retirement system
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't hit its numbers it also falls
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
back on the state to make up the
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the in employee
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
contributions and also even in a defined
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
benefit plan if
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the rates don't keep up with
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
inflation or the benefit doesn't keep up
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
with inflation there is the potential
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
for a cost of living adjustments which
 
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
would in order to keep up with the cost
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
of living which would also fall back on
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer and the employer the the
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
employees not so so it's not as though
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
then once again not trying to argue with
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
you but no that's fine thinking out loud
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
you know there it's not as though a
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan is exempt from that
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
right so so what we're also talking
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up inflation in
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the cola
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the Senate just passed a
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
cola yesterday okay it's it's it's it's
 
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
in the process the the comment about a
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan not being able to
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
keep up with inflation you need to
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand we have a mechanism in place
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
for that yes it's politically sensitive
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
of course as it should be when you're
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with taxpayer dollars
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay what's concerning is also the
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
comment made here earlier this morning
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
was that I believe 50 percent
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
of people that work for the state don't
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't make it to the vesting period I
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
think that came from New Hampshire
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
retirement system is that okay yeah so
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's an awful lot of people
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
under under group three
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay because they're 100 invested on the
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
day that they get that dollar that's a
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
whole lot of taxpayer dollars going out
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
the window
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
whereas currently right now they are as
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
as I believe Marty said from retirement
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
system that it stays in the system until
 
01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's vested
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
so that's again nobody's talking about
 
01:48:18.649 --> 01:48:18.659 align:start position:0%
all those all those taxpayer dollars
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
potentially going with these portable
 
01:48:24.649 --> 01:48:24.659 align:start position:0%
employees as as as explained well once
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
again for clarification we we did talk
 
01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
about that and we talked about it for a
 
01:48:28.619 --> 01:48:29.930 align:start position:0%
about that and we talked about it for a
while

01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and the question I think that we
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
haven't maybe you can answer it um
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
because you're the representative of the
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
employees correct that is correct so
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
they the employees themselves are the
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
ones receiving those benefits
 
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think the way that we would
 
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
look at it from a defined contribution
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
standpoint is they have earned those
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
benefits they're available to them right
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
away as employees of the state and
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
they're getting the direct benefit from
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
that and the question as to whether or
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
not that is balanced out a little bit by
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
the uaal funds coming in without any
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
necessity for a future benefit out of
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement system excuse me
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
potentially keeps the
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire retirement system on
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
the same footing while at the same time
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
allowing the employee to take a greater
 
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
benefit shorter have access to that and
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
be able to keep the money that they've
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
made as opposed to having to give it
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
back to the state if they don't stick
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
around long enough so right there's a
 
01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:29.219 align:start position:0%
potential benefit either way right
 
01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:31.940 align:start position:0%
there's a real misconception here
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
that state employees are just state
 
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.229 align:start position:0%
that state employees are just state
employees

01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
state employees are also taxpayers
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they have absolutely every single
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
right to comment on taxpayer situations
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
as it relates to pieces of legislation
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
in this state yes they're employees but
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're also taxpayers and it's
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
concerning that there's a mechanism
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
under group three now in this bill
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
to allow taxpayer dollars
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
for being properly vested in the 10-year
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
period that we currently have are now
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
just being portable and we've heard from
 
01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:10.139 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that we're talking
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
going to be thousands of people that
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
aren't ever going to be invested and all
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
those taxpayer dollars which normally
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
would have stayed in the system
 
01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
are not any longer yes representative
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
gerhardt uh thank you chairman so I'm a
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
little bit confused here wouldn't it
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
benefit the employees to take the money
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
that they earned for their retirement
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative what we're talking about
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
here is recruitment and retention
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the ability right
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
now where we have two really good things
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
to offer for current employees we have
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we also have the voluntary Deferred
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
Comp which is essentially like a 401k
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
okay that's a wonderful thing because
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know you're absolutely going to get
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
something with a defined benefit and
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
then you can play around a little bit
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
with your with your Deferred Comp in in
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
hope if we're talking about what's best
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
for the employee okay what's best for
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
the employee is is not necessarily from
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
our perspective as representing not only
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
not only 10 000 employees but ten
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
thousand taxpayers as well what's best
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the system and the system also
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
includes retention and recruitment so
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
the thought of that we can bring people
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
in here now keep in mind we're partners
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
with the state right we are partners
 
01:51:30.169 --> 01:51:30.179 align:start position:0%
with the state and part of that
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
partnership is is making sure that we
 
01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
have an overall well-functioning system
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
so thinking that we can have employees
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
come in take taxpayer dollars and just
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
then take that taxpay dollars and leave
 
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else it's not necessarily
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
our view as as the what's best for the
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
overall system
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm saying is
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
if you want retention you want people to
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
come into the system to start working
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that they don't have to stay 10
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
years before they could actually have
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
some of their own money in their hands
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
to me doesn't really encourage somebody
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
to start joining up especially when we
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
learn that 50 or whatever the number was
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
never make it to investment so that's
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying so I I know you know
 
01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
what representative that's a great point
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I actually
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
um have on my laptop an amendment ready
 
01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
to go should you ever want to say that
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
current group one and group two
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
employees have a hundred percent of
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
their monies invested the day they put
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
it in I think we both know the result of
 
01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
that piece of legislation but if it's
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
good Logic for group three moving
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
forward why wouldn't it be good Logic
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
for group one and two currently
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
well my whole position is I just want to
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
stop the bleeding so all right thank you
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
correct thank you well that would be my
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
other question for you uh well actually
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
shoot I had a question that was
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
specifically for you that you would be
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll come back to me you can
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
continue on it until I figure it out
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just close with that
 
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure you were all
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
handed earlier a couple weeks ago the
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
case study in West Virginia
 
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
and I just I'm just going to take two
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
seconds and read this it won't take very
 
01:53:14.810 --> 01:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
long no you're fine go ahead for 17
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
years West Virginia teachers were
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a 401k style defined
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
contribution plan
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
eventually West Virginia legislature
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
voted to reopen the closed defined
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
benefit pension plan after a study
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
showed that the pension plan offered
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
equivalent benefits at half the cost of
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
the defined contribution plan
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
when teachers in the defined
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
contribution plan were given the choice
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
to switch to the to the reopen Pension
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
Plan more than 78 percent made the
 
01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:47.149 align:start position:0%
Plan more than 78 percent made the
switch

01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
switch
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
when you look at every single state that
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
has entertained
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
potentially changing to a defined
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
contribution plan
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
and they had an actual financial and now
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
professional financial analysis done
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
all of those states with the exception
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
of one one being Oklahoma
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
okay all of them chose not to go down
 
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
that road because it didn't make
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
Financial sense
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
I would ask today if there's a financial
 
01:54:17.159 --> 01:54:18.649 align:start position:0%
I would ask today if there's a financial
study

01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
financial analysis that this committee
 
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
is entertaining
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
right now to give them an informed
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
decision moving forward
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
I have not yet seen that study I don't
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
think you have either the responsible
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
thing to do with this type of this is
 
01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.179 align:start position:0%
serious stuff for adding a whole new
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
classification of an employee
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
not to be taken lightly
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
but I would offer
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
every single state that had done this
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
that that that did a true financial
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
analysis with the exception of Oklahoma
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
chose not to do it and you might want to
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
just again pause on this
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll end with that and I'll I'll
 
01:55:00.169 --> 01:55:00.179 align:start position:0%
certainly take any more questions
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
we have a retiree here is that is that
 
01:55:10.689 --> 01:55:10.699 align:start position:0%
probably not for this particular thing
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
she's part of the SCA
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
but just a few minutes I don't have a
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Simon thanks for
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
letting me give give you some input
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm Virginia Clifford I'm currently
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
the president of the retiree chapter of
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
the sea I retired a little over five
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
years ago first half of my career was as
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
a teacher second half at the department
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
of Ed
 
01:55:44.209 --> 01:55:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and I think even before the dilution
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
that of the retirement benefits that we
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
saw in the 2011 changes when I first
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
went to the department it was a revered
 
01:55:55.729 --> 01:55:55.739 align:start position:0%
position and many of the people that
 
01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
came in were seasoned Educators we were
 
01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:01.100 align:start position:0%
bringing our wisdom to the state
 
01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
in informing policy based on having
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
actually been been teachers I see that
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
having changed dramatically
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
um it had begun before I left and from
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
what I see now it's a revolving door at
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed and you're not
 
01:56:16.199 --> 01:56:17.350 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed and you're not
getting

01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
seasoned Educators and wisdom you um
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
you're getting people who are using it
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
for a stepping stone to do more
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
um there isn't really a lot of incentive
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
as much incentive even now people have
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
to work there for 20 years to get a
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
state retiree benefit
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
for me I left teaching I came to the
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
state I was paid less money for a while
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
but I came because I wanted to continue
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system and I was aging
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
I didn't envision myself being a great
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
teacher when I was 60.
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I think I brought a lot to the state
 
01:56:58.729 --> 01:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
in making that transition from the the
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
teaching part of my career to the State
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education part of my
 
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.810 align:start position:0%
Department of Education part of my
career

01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:06.470 align:start position:0%
career
um

01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
it was worth it for me to stay
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
if I had a defined benefit at that point
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
I could have taken some of the things
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
that I was learning those last few years
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
now after being at the department for a
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
while I had learned about Data Systems I
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
learned about database building I knew
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
how to give influence I had skills at
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
that point I would have been perhaps
 
01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
better off to say you know I can take
 
01:57:34.689 --> 01:57:34.699 align:start position:0%
what I have go out and really
 
01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
improve but I stayed you know and now my
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
own situation I was fortunate to be able
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
to put away money and Define comp
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
I have defined benefit right now I'm
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
able to live on that and let my other
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
money grow but with what happened you
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
know the last few years it's my money in
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
the Deferred Comp Tanked
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate I didn't need it I've been
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
able to ride through that period if I
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
had had something catastrophic and
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's all I had and I had to pull out
 
01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I no longer had the principle to or
 
01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:13.139 align:start position:0%
the the money that was there to continue
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
growing I mean it's just such a risk I
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
have so much more that I have because of
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit and that's why I
 
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
stayed so bring that over to what are we
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
now offering to State Employees and you
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
all we all know labor is it's a big
 
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
issue how do we attract Talent how do we
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
keep Talent how do we bring young keep
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
young people in the state
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
um what are we providing for them for
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
their future you know why work at a job
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
where you probably make less salary
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
unless you get something as a trade-off
 
01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so I just I think the Recruitment and
 
01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
Retention issue is enormous
 
01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.169 align:start position:0%
Retention issue is enormous
um

01:58:57.169 --> 01:58:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
so I could go on but you asked me to be
 
01:59:00.119 --> 01:59:01.310 align:start position:0%
so I could go on but you asked me to be
brief

01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the brevity I don't have a
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and I did remember the question that
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
I had which is what is the what is the
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
average benefit
 
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
um for your
 
01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:15.470 align:start position:0%
um for your
constituents

01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head and certainly
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
stand corrected
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
I believe it's is it twenty one thousand
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
roughly twenty one thousand
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
okay right and if and I've I've done
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
some homework on that too where if you
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
um other states where you where you can
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
can do a side by side of a defined
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
benefit and Define contribution you'll
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
see that the the defined benefit has
 
01:59:46.729 --> 01:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
which is indicating of what we're trying
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
to explain here
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you guys so much
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
for your testimony appreciate it thank
 
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
you and us I'm going to turn it back to
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
the committee here and see what see what
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
I feel like you're giving me that face
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
every time you look at me there Mr
 
02:00:05.099 --> 02:00:09.709 align:start position:0%
every time you look at me there Mr
Robert

02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
by May of course Mr chairman
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking about something that
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
started off as a trend
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
since the dawn of Labor people basically
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
worked under a defined benefit type of
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
program whether it be like in the
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
example of the old Shoe Shop you did
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
your 30 years in the shoe shop and they
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
gave you one of these beautiful watches
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
when you retired but you also got
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
yourself a pension it was damn good for
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
your grandfather
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay for your grandmother you lived they
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
lived they were prosperous
 
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay but then came the 80s oh my God are
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
we suffering from the 80s because terms
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
came up such as Headhunters
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
we don't use the term hanhunters too
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
much anymore now do we because again
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
like being Trends they don't last
 
02:01:08.689 --> 02:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
forever but they wanted a pension plan
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the date could be able to put into their
 
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
the date could be able to put into their
briefcase

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
briefcase
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
and move around from job to job because
 
02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
in that type of field oh you're working
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
for Wang how long are you working for
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
when oh you've been there six years why
 
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
don't you come work for IBM
 
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
things are better so they get a vice
 
02:01:31.609 --> 02:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
presidency at IBM and they swapped all
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
these different jobs and into the little
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
briefcases they put they invented the
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
401K not the best
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
benefit for the employee
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
best benefit to put into your briefcase
 
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
and bring with you with it to a
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
different job but does not equal the
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
financial is what we just heard what the
 
02:01:56.689 --> 02:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
numbers and the facts of for a pension
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
plan firemen cops teaches ah community
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
Community they don't travel
 
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
they get hired for uh just just for a
 
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
clarification representative O'Brien
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're not affected by this particular
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
Bill no I understand but State work is
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
there too I mean so they get hired by
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
their communities they work and the
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
state is a community
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay take it high to go to work and
 
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
everything else there's no need for the
 
02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
401K they're not going anywhere else
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
what they want for their commitment is
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
the best benefit program that they can
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
basically get and when you work in
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
public service I can attest after 35
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
years employees the job stinks but the
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
betties were good but the trouble is now
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
the pennies aren't that good we're
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
seeing now a beginning of this or in
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
another erosion into the benefit wall
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's creating now I have
 
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
and if the committee wants it I'll have
 
02:03:05.890 --> 02:03:05.900 align:start position:0%
something on your desk by this afternoon
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
from uh it's a newspaper article from
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
The Washington Post of the inventor of
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
the 401K who says it has deep regret
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
that he came up with that because the
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
where's the cost benefit analysis I'll
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
tell you where it went it went into the
 
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
profitability into the different
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
corporations that we're making it they
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
didn't have to meet the obligations that
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
one has to make underneath the defined
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
benefit program it's not the best and I
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
think even with people why is this under
 
02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:46.790 align:start position:0%
think even with people why is this under
attack

02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
attack
 
02:03:49.689 --> 02:03:49.699 align:start position:0%
because even the people who are under
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know this new like 401ks and the
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
such they don't like people with the
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
Divine benefit because they're jealous
 
02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:04.139 align:start position:0%
they wish that they had it they should
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
have it maybe things need to change in
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
labor and maybe the whole thing and you
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
say and represent a God I too want to
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
stop the bleeding I mean I hate paying
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
into the uh ual but I'll guarantee you
 
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
was a one clap not one firemen not one
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
teacher nor one person from dot that
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
created the ual
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
that was created by municipalities when
 
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
the system was a hundred percent funded
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
and they went up and they asked the
 
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.010 align:start position:0%
and they went up and they asked the
state

02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
if it's a hundred percent funded do we
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it turned out and then when he
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
looked at the numbers and the aggregate
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
was different and everything else came
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
to cabbage and that's how we got into
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
trouble maybe you ought to ask what
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
brought us here
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
before we try to you know performance
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
he's actually on the sub did you want to
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
say something you know
 
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm an official subcommittee member yeah
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
no I
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
I agree with you but I think
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
the fundamental problem okay
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
good fundamental problems government
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
government has grown so large state
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
federal everything there's more
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
employees coming in I think that's kind
 
02:05:17.890 --> 02:05:17.900 align:start position:0%
of the critical issue here we can't so
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
aside from that
 
02:05:20.159 --> 02:05:21.709 align:start position:0%
aside from that
the

02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
I just personally I don't see why we're
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
even playing with people's retirement
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
money anyway I I wouldn't trust you guys
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
with my retirement and I don't I just I
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
I just find that kind of it's to me it's
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
confusing as to why government a messed
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
this up
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
government B can do a little bit better
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
job governments see the future
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
government we don't even know what
 
02:05:42.169 --> 02:05:42.179 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with this that's why
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
at least giving people the ability to
 
02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
take their money with them to me makes
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
more sense now all the fees going to the
 
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
mega corporations totally against that
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I still think that people should be
 
02:05:51.890 --> 02:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
have the option of just taking their
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
money with them right off the rip I it's
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
their money so I agree with you that but
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm going to say on that but
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying representative care hard
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
is you take somebody who works for DOT
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
or Clapper or firemen uh other than the
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
American flag that we all salute to and
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
everything else like that a lot of that
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
political things doesn't mean a heck of
 
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
a lot I'll tell you uh God and country
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
did nothing for me when I was climbing
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
with the hose line and up to three
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
flights of stairs watching The
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
Cockroaches climb out the walls because
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
they were the first ones out of the
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
building when the place was on fire it
 
02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
didn't matter yeah you know the first
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
person I got to I didn't go rescue kids
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
first or elderly adults who was the
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
first person they came to and I imagine
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
with the D.O.T you find it in state
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
workers you're finding the same thing
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
they have a job to do and they do do it
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
well and who is the benefit see that's
 
02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
what you're forgetting what are we
 
02:06:50.330 --> 02:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
selling to who are you taking I mean who
 
02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:51.659 align:start position:0%
is the person
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
who is the you know like I say the
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
stakeholder of the benefit of having
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
state employees and that is the public
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
you take somebody you may hate to stand
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
in line at the D.O.T representative but
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe if you paid a few extra dollars to
 
02:07:12.530 --> 02:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
have another secretary at D.O.T you get
 
02:07:15.050 --> 02:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
out of there quicker the thing is that
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
that is the benefit so as far as the
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
conversation goes and we are running a
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
little bit short on time I appreciate
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah no no I mean all I'm all I'm
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to say is I I prefer not to cast
 
02:07:28.729 --> 02:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
aspersions on people's motives for why
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
they may want to make up no and if I did
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
I apologize there was none none take it
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
but the thing is it you know the former
 
02:07:38.209 --> 02:07:38.219 align:start position:0%
government we have has nothing to do
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
with the pension plan
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
basically yes should it be run right and
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
everything else but you know something
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know why we're here and you know I
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're faced with the problems because 12
 
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
years ago 11 years ago people thought
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
they were going to fix the system you
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
didn't fix nothing
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
you broke it more
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to repair
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
here something to get broken and some of
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
the names
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that are on this sheet with people that
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
and you can ask and you can check the
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
facts I'm well aware of who is who is
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
involved when
 
02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:18.109 align:start position:0%
involved when
um

02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
when the system was broken
 
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that there's an overlap
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
between how we broke it the first time
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
in this particular plan
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that the the risks
 
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
involved are the same thing as what
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
happened the first time so I don't know
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we can make that particular
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
comparison between the two
 
02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.089 align:start position:0%
comparison between the two
um

02:08:38.089 --> 02:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to say I do not include
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
myself in the Wii previously mentioned
 
02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I would like to step back but I
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
would like to say of course I am going
 
02:08:57.010 --> 02:08:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.570 --> 02:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely no I would just like to uh
 
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
because of the testimony I would just
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
like to point out
 
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that the intentions
 
02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
obviously and I will stick to intentions
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the people who are bringing this
 
02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment um to change the
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
nature of the retirement for these
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
individuals are doing so in order to
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
take something I think they're hoping
 
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
that it will give something they may be
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
right they may be wrong it may work it
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
may not work but I don't think that
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
their intentions are are negative so I
 
02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:29.099 align:start position:0%
just don't I want to make sure that
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're not communicating that it's good
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
guys versus bad guys
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
um it may be Works doesn't work again so
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work in one way or the other
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
or works better or works less well but I
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't I know my colleagues and I I
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to cast aspersions on them
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
oh it's just uh us Irish have the the
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
road to position is paved in gold and I
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I love that about you representative
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
Brian I just for the record I want to
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
make the statement that's all
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the subcommittee have
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
any comments so I'll have to stick to
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee at this point because
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're running short on time
 
02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
all set representative Davis
 
02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard we're good Okay
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
so we've discussed the issue we're down
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
to about seven minutes is anybody
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable making a motion on this
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment
 
02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:10:20.070 --> 02:10:32.209 align:start position:0%
representative true
[Music]

02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.770 --> 02:10:35.780 align:start position:0%
oh to pass is amended point of order yes
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh it seems that uh
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
if you take a poll of the committee it
 
02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be fairly Representative
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
no but I do have a quorum and
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt was was here and
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
left I didn't force him to leave okay
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
and and this seems to be
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
and and I and I think you understand it
 
02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
seems to be the vote here could be not
 
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
really reflective of what the committee
 
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
has really stood for and and the
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
committee itself can speak to that in 45
 
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
minutes as well we're not making a
 
02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
minutes as well we're not making a
definitive

02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
definitive
 
02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
a definitive decision at this particular
 
02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
point it's just a recommendation the
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee can discuss it overturn it and
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
bring forward a new recommendation we
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
just have to bring something but I think
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
as you know as a power of a subcommittee
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
they do have the legal authority to make
 
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the full board
 
02:11:29.890 --> 02:11:29.900 align:start position:0%
because they're doing the Yeomans work
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
and I just don't know if the vote would
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
be reflective
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
equally of the quality of the work that
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
was I I agree with you representative
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
O'Brien for sure my problem is I can't
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
get a sub at this point and I have to
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
have it out of the subcommittee in about
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 minutes
 
02:11:51.890 --> 02:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
but just bringing it up okay that's
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
that's fair and and if I had the power
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
which I don't at this particular point
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
to appoint you as a member of the
 
02:11:59.450 --> 02:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to vote I I would do that
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't have that power so I just
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to bring something
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
to the committee we do I I have to do it
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes will do as they will the committee
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
will do as they will they have an
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
obligation to bring this book correct so
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
I have I have a motion of uh to pass
 
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
with Amendment on hb559 do I have a
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
second for that
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
all right representative Gerhard seconds
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
um all in favor
 
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
all opposed
 
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
all right we will bring that
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full exec session
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
this afternoon guys uh thank you so much
 
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
I was worried for your safety if you
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
didn't vote that way because
 
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien might do
 
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.569 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien might do
something

02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:12:50.579 --> 02:12:51.790 align:start position:0%
something
um

02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if I should ask
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien to leave
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
no it's totally it's totally fine
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but we'll bring that recommendation
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee and of course
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
the committee will have full power to do
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
as it wishes so thank you for your time
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for everybody who gave
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%

02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
half an hour hopefully have some time
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%

according to the subcommittee I would
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
like to move uh to pass with amendments
 
02:49:48.050 --> 02:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
on HB four five seven and I would like
 
02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
to bring forward Amendment zero eight
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%

02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
there were copies on the table
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay I don't necessarily know that I
 
02:50:22.490 --> 02:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
know at this point is there
 
02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:50:27.010 --> 02:50:27.020 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
version of true seconded thank you
 
02:50:32.450 --> 02:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you madam chair
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the build basically does three things
 
02:50:39.290 --> 02:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh it requires
 
02:50:41.210 --> 02:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
um that the treasurer's fiduciary
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility is put into statute uh
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that she is using solely
 
02:50:46.969 --> 02:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility and making
 
02:50:49.610 --> 02:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
Investments uh it also
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
um requires that the treasurer make a
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
report to the legislative body
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
um every quarter about the fiduciary
 
02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility what they're investing in
 
02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
and it does the same the third part is
 
02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
it does the same for the New Hampshire
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system so in essence it it
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
just gives us a little bit more
 
02:51:08.809 --> 02:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
oversight and transparency as in as to
 
02:51:10.910 --> 02:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
the investment strategies
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that these groups are making and it
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
also requires that the treasurer use
 
02:51:16.849 --> 02:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility which is not
 
02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
presently in statute and the
 
02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was unanimous in saying
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
that those things seemed relatively
 
02:51:23.929 --> 02:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
02:51:26.450 --> 02:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
all right representative true
 
02:51:29.450 --> 02:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the vice chair
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
summed it up very nicely but just to
 
02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh
 
02:51:34.969 --> 02:51:34.979 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in statutes saying that
 
02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
the state treasury will use the best
 
02:51:39.050 --> 02:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibilities and that puts
 
02:51:41.570 --> 02:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
us in that's no offense to them I'm sure
 
02:51:43.610 --> 02:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
that's what they're doing but that's the
 
02:51:45.410 --> 02:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
important thing of this and plus the
 
02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:47.870 align:start position:0%
important thing of this and plus the
legislative

02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
02:51:51.230 --> 02:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
speak on the amendment representative
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
Rhoda I do have a question for the
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the um component of
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
457 that indicated to the
 
02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:07.309 align:start position:0%
457 that indicated to the
state

02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:52:09.230 --> 02:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
um in the investment of funds that
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
regarded to certain
 
02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
um sectors of the market
 
02:52:18.410 --> 02:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
that has that been removed all right yes
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
that that's been removed there's no
 
02:52:23.450 --> 02:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
um specific
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
language towards any particular group or
 
02:52:27.710 --> 02:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
investment it just is a report that
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be made that if if for some
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
reason there is multiple reasons for
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
investing they just have to note that on
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
a report that they give to the
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislature but they're not forbidden to
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
do so as long as they're following
 
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate fiduciary responsibility the
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the entire it
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill so yes any any
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
comments about ESG or any of that is no
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure yes follow
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
up excuse me and the and this this
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%

02:57:47.450 --> 02:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.330 --> 02:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.340 --> 02:57:52.210 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:57:52.210 --> 02:57:52.220 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
all right so do we wish to speak to your
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
motion representative Lucas I do
 
02:57:57.359 --> 02:58:00.650 align:start position:0%
motion representative Lucas I do
um

02:58:00.650 --> 02:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:03.230 --> 02:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think we we discussed this before it
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
provides it creates a um
 
02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
a defined Contra a defined contribution
 
02:58:11.929 --> 02:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
plan for state employees who are uh
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
group one so not uh the permanent police
 
02:58:16.910 --> 02:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
and fire and just at the state level not
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision the employees
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
will contribute the same amount as they
 
02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
do in the current pension plan the
 
02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:24.110 align:start position:0%
do in the current pension plan the
employer

02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
will do the same and the employer will
 
02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
continue to make payments to the uaal
 
02:58:32.570 --> 02:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
for the trailing obligation
 
02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
I mean some of the advantage of this
 
02:58:37.969 --> 02:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
this is right now those employees over
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
half of them end up leaving before
 
02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're vested that's the 10 years
 
02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that means that although they get
 
02:58:46.370 --> 02:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
back their contributions and some small
 
02:58:50.210 --> 02:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
interest on it they lose the employer
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
part and any gains on the employer part
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
with the defined contribution plan
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
you get the entire amount you know the
 
02:59:02.210 --> 02:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
entire amount is your money you own it
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
um but you know the day it's put in so
 
02:59:05.929 --> 02:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
every pay period
 
02:59:05.939 --> 02:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
every pay period
um

02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that well for uh a
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan not only is the
 
02:59:15.650 --> 02:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
employee bearing the uh inflation risk
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
but they're also burying the political
 
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
risk of whether or not the legislature
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
decides to Grant a cola and you can
 
02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
consider the history of what that's been
 
02:59:25.790 --> 02:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
in a defined contribution plan
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
investments in equities and some other
 
02:59:30.830 --> 02:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
things tend to grow at least with
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
inflation and usually greater than that
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that provides protection from that
 
02:59:37.730 --> 02:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's also greater flexibility
 
02:59:42.769 --> 02:59:42.779 align:start position:0%
you know when they if they leave
 
02:59:44.630 --> 02:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
employment they can leave either leave
 
02:59:46.490 --> 02:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
it there or they can roll it over into
 
02:59:49.250 --> 02:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
an IRA or 401k or any other retirement
 
02:59:49.260 --> 02:59:50.450 align:start position:0%
an IRA or 401k or any other retirement
plan

02:59:50.450 --> 02:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
and when they do choose to retire
 
02:59:55.550 --> 02:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know they can control at what rate
 
02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
they take the money out so maybe shortly
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
after they retire they want to do some
 
03:00:02.929 --> 03:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
traveling and spend a little more and uh
 
03:00:04.969 --> 03:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
and take less out later they have that
 
03:00:07.130 --> 03:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
with a pension you get whatever your
 
03:00:09.550 --> 03:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
benefit is and that's what you get
 
03:00:12.830 --> 03:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
03:00:17.389 --> 03:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.330 --> 03:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay represent food to speak to your
 
03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:21.650 align:start position:0%
okay represent food to speak to your
second

03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I believe I think it was mentioned
 
03:00:28.370 --> 03:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
but I I think it needs to be mentioned
 
03:00:28.380 --> 03:00:29.090 align:start position:0%
but I I think it needs to be mentioned
again

03:00:29.090 --> 03:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
that in this group three
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the employer is still paying in
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability
 
03:00:39.889 --> 03:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
and that is without any obligation
 
03:00:42.469 --> 03:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
to the pension plan itself
 
03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's a benefit to
 
03:00:47.809 --> 03:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
the to the current benefit plan and
 
03:00:50.090 --> 03:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
which strengthens it and hopefully will
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
as projected
 
03:00:58.250 --> 03:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
so anyone else we should comment
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative Broda I do have a
 
03:01:02.929 --> 03:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair if I may um how
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
does the amendment change the original
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bill uh thank you I should have said
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
that um in the original bill it
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
permitted existing employees who were
 
03:01:15.650 --> 03:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
employed before the start date of July 1
 
03:01:19.730 --> 03:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
2024 to opt into this plan we took that
 
03:01:21.530 --> 03:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
out because uh
 
03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
we were informed by uh Marty from the
 
03:01:24.180 --> 03:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
we were informed by uh Marty from the
nhrs

03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
nhrs
 
03:01:28.670 --> 03:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
that that might violate
 
03:01:32.929 --> 03:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
um the IRS rules in particular we would
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
be allowing people in the pension plan
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
to take their money out of the pension
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
plan and put it in this defined
 
03:01:40.730 --> 03:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
contribution plan which he believed um
 
03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
was not permitted and so we took it out
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
no I'll follow up and the sentence the
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
accrued liability contribution
 
03:01:50.929 --> 03:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
percentage is chargeable to a group
 
03:01:52.730 --> 03:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
three employees shall be determined by
 
03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
charging the group one member accrued
 
03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
liability contributions for the group
 
03:01:59.210 --> 03:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
three members what does that mean okay
 
03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
that that takes the amount that the
 
03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
employee has to pay towards the
 
03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
retirement by reference so it's the same
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
in both so that if we ever change the
 
03:02:11.090 --> 03:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
number which is going to happen when the
 
03:02:13.969 --> 03:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
ual is close to being paid off we don't
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to change it in two places and it's
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
seven percent currently it's a
 
03:02:22.490 --> 03:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
one last question
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
so in the subcommittee work what
 
03:02:31.250 --> 03:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you did this but I just don't
 
03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
see it here was there there what fiscal
 
03:02:38.570 --> 03:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
or financial analysis was done long term
 
03:02:40.190 --> 03:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
on the effect of the retirement system
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
on this plan we heard from uh from Marty
 
03:02:47.929 --> 03:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
from nhrs and he told us that it was uh
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
if any it was negligible and he had no
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
objection to this
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's with you with uaal uh
 
03:02:56.809 --> 03:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
contribution which is part of this
 
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative
 
03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:03:04.969 --> 03:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
um I'll be voting against the amendment
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the bill
 
03:03:09.610 --> 03:03:09.620 align:start position:0%
um I have stated for many years
 
03:03:13.450 --> 03:03:13.460 align:start position:0%
that I feel part of the problem with
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
retention and recruitment is the
 
03:03:20.450 --> 03:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
constant changing that the legislature
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
has been doing to benefits for state
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
employees and I feel it has a chilling
 
03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:26.769 align:start position:0%
employees and I feel it has a chilling
effect

03:03:26.769 --> 03:03:26.779 align:start position:0%
effect
 
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
having been a state employee myself and
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
having contact with many employees and
 
03:03:37.250 --> 03:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
retirees I hear this all the time and
 
03:03:41.389 --> 03:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason for flight
 
03:03:43.010 --> 03:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
from the job
 
03:03:44.830 --> 03:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Simon and
 
03:03:49.969 --> 03:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
then Alexis thank you madam chair just
 
03:03:51.710 --> 03:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
for clarification on this this bill
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect anybody who is currently
 
03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
hired and already in a benefit plan it
 
03:04:00.410 --> 03:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
would only apply to new hires and they
 
03:04:02.090 --> 03:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
would be offered this plan at the time
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
of their hire if it were to pass so it
 
03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
isn't a situation in which we are
 
03:04:08.210 --> 03:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
changing a benefit on somebody
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's benefit plan will stay as it
 
03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:13.010 align:start position:0%
everybody's benefit plan will stay as it
is

03:04:13.010 --> 03:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.250 --> 03:04:15.260 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and their neighbor
 
03:04:18.349 --> 03:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
right and one of the um the motive
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
motivations to put this in is that it
 
03:04:23.929 --> 03:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
might actually ask act as a benefit to
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment right now less than half of
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
the of these employees uh group one
 
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
stay vested until they're 10 years and
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
they lose all the employer contribution
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
and Gain
 
03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
whereas with the defined benefit
 
03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
contribution plan that's their property
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know in the day every payroll
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
when those contributions are made both
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
their contribution and the employer's
 
03:04:49.790 --> 03:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
contribution and any gain is theirs and
 
03:04:51.769 --> 03:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't have the legal ability
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:57.650 --> 03:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
the bay bear and then o'bri foreign
 
03:05:00.050 --> 03:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have two
 
03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
comments I remember that during the
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
hearing it was presented by the sponsor
 
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
two charts one chart of the unrealized
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
liability of what it should have been in
 
03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
the unrealized liability of where we are
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
today in the retirement system and that
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
being a major pivotal point or
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
springboard to go ahead and launch this
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
legislation the fact that it also
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect any current employees I
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
love that part of that and also giving
 
03:05:33.590 --> 03:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
freedom to the younger generation that
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
wants to go in and switch their
 
03:05:39.650 --> 03:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
retirements around or you know do their
 
03:05:41.809 --> 03:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
own Investments that take it with them
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
if they decide to leave and you know
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're we are dealing with a younger
 
03:05:47.450 --> 03:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
generation coming in that wants those
 
03:05:49.490 --> 03:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
freedom of choices so for all those
 
03:05:51.230 --> 03:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll be supporting this bill and
 
03:05:52.849 --> 03:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you okay
 
03:05:55.450 --> 03:05:55.460 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien uh thank you
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
madam chip I am not going to support
 
03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
this I had the uh
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
I was very fortunate to be able to sit
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
in much of the consternation of my good
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
friend representative Simon in the uh
 
03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but uh what representative
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
leckis uh in helped me out here there
 
03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
were several things that were identified
 
03:06:19.370 --> 03:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
that were left out of this particular
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
bill that needs to be worked so there's
 
03:06:24.530 --> 03:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
a question number one that it's not
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time to go to the full
 
03:06:29.330 --> 03:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
board that it may need some fixing am I
 
03:06:32.210 --> 03:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
correct in saying that
 
03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
um there were comments made to that
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
effect I disagree with them
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and if you're I mean the one I if
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
you're considering the uh I think you
 
03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
know the uh the disability one I mean
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
there is a disability benefit as part of
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
the pension
 
03:06:49.790 --> 03:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
um with the with this if you become
 
03:06:49.800 --> 03:06:50.990 align:start position:0%
um with the with this if you become
disabled

03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
um you know that's a situation where you
 
03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
can start taking the money out and
 
03:06:57.170 --> 03:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
you're still eligible at least the group
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
one I don't know about group two but
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're not touching that uh you're still
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for SSI disability
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
and follow up if I may uh it seems also
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
too it was heard by uh some of the
 
03:07:13.690 --> 03:07:13.700 align:start position:0%
representatives of uh state employees uh
 
03:07:17.090 --> 03:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh associations uh
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
and I think uh well just state did come
 
03:07:23.210 --> 03:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
up uh one of the things changes upon 59
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
they want to eliminate that I'm going by
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
the fourth page number 10 and they
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to remove that to go to the 65.
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
again that's something that's very
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
important that was left out but we did
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
also hear too if we look at page four
 
03:07:42.410 --> 03:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
and then number 12 what happens if the
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
member dies and everything and there
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
seems to be some questions if you know
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
on how they would receive to survivors
 
03:07:51.530 --> 03:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
received to some of the the death
 
03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:52.730 align:start position:0%
received to some of the the death
benefits

03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative that's actually uh
 
03:07:59.690 --> 03:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
controlled by the IRS regulations on
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
these plans and we have to follow those
 
03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:02.389 align:start position:0%
these plans and we have to follow those
regulations

03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
so that the contributions in the gains
 
03:08:05.340 --> 03:08:06.650 align:start position:0%
so that the contributions in the gains
are

03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
free from tax but you know I've been
 
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
involved in an equivalent plan and you
 
03:08:14.570 --> 03:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
specify when you sign up who your
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are going to be and uh and
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
that you know what happens is they
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
inherit in effect an IRA
 
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and they can take money out of it or
 
03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:26.690 align:start position:0%
um and they can take money out of it or
not

03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you know they can they can keep it in
 
03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
there and let it grow and take it out
 
03:08:29.340 --> 03:08:30.889 align:start position:0%
there and let it grow and take it out
later

03:08:30.889 --> 03:08:30.899 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:08:32.929 --> 03:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
um when they when when you would when
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
the owner of it the original person
 
03:08:36.349 --> 03:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
would have reached currently 70 and a
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
half years old there's a required
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
minimum distribution you have to start
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking some amounts out and that person
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
who inherited that and I'm familiar with
 
03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
this because unfortunately my mother
 
03:08:48.410 --> 03:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
passed away and I inherited an IRA that
 
03:08:49.969 --> 03:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
she had and I've been uh dealing with
 
03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
that but that's how it works
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's a well-established policy and your
 
03:08:58.849 --> 03:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
spouse has to agree to putting any other
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
person as a beneficiary of this plan
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up if I may again please
 
03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:05.870 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up if I may again please
um

03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:08.210 --> 03:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know I grew up in that generation
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
that Mom and Dad had like the Christmas
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
account where you put money away uh so
 
03:09:17.389 --> 03:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
the US kiddos can see any claws gave us
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
a good gift and basically you put two
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
nickels in the bank and you know you
 
03:09:23.809 --> 03:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
kind of hope they rub together and they
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
made a dollar or whatever happens in the
 
03:09:29.210 --> 03:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
bank uh but the thing is and I don't
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
care what happens in the bank but the
 
03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
thing is this seems to be an erosion to
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
some degree even though it is negligible
 
03:09:39.769 --> 03:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
but it isn't eroding is it not better
 
03:09:42.290 --> 03:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
than I get to ask the question is it not
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
better to have the maximum amount of
 
03:09:47.570 --> 03:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
employees into like uh the nhrs
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system paying under the same
 
03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
rates and everything that helps that
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
particular system to grow
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative blackis and then
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard okay
 
03:10:02.450 --> 03:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
um so first of all the the normal
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
contributions which is uh the
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
contributions to meet and actually sound
 
03:10:09.290 --> 03:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
pension for that employee doesn't go in
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand the retirement
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
system is not picking up
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of paying a pension
 
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh the uaal is going in there to meet
 
03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
the trailing obligations which is I
 
03:10:23.090 --> 03:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
think 10.9 something percent of the of
 
03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
the of the gross payroll
 
03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that the I mean
 
03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
the the current Investments the pension
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
plan they've got something over 11
 
03:10:33.410 --> 03:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
billion dollars if I'm remembering
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
correctly and so you know a small
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
difference is if it got really tiny
 
03:10:39.889 --> 03:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
there might be an issue but it's on an
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue and uh and and uh Mr Carlin
 
03:10:47.090 --> 03:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um testified that the retirement system
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
has no concerns about this right and my
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
final cut and call curtain call please
 
03:10:56.110 --> 03:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:10:58.969 --> 03:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna get into this Blondie
 
03:11:03.889 --> 03:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
Stone kissing thing again but anyways uh
 
03:11:07.130 --> 03:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to get into you bring up
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
some of the things of the political
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
whims and like we just heard uh we just
 
03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
passed or looked at the colas and
 
03:11:16.730 --> 03:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
everything else like that we could
 
03:11:19.610 --> 03:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
easily fix that by putting like a uh
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
equally come up with another build I
 
03:11:23.450 --> 03:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
would guarantee a cooler every five
 
03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
years similar to Social Security or
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
something like that and let's keep in
 
03:11:30.889 --> 03:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
mind why are people leaving nobody's
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
answered that question you're fixing a
 
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
problem here and saying well people
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
leave anyways but why are they leaving
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
is it because is it they're frozen and a
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
particular rate of pay within the state
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
with no chance of
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
advancement or no incentive or pay in
 
03:11:50.510 --> 03:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
other for them to have like a longer
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
type of career that would fit within
 
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
this parameter uh representative thank
 
03:11:57.650 --> 03:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
you um
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are a variety of reasons
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
why it's difficult to recruit for the
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
state jobs
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
pay is I'm as I'm sure part of it but
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're addressing in this
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
bill they're you know especially with
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
younger employees who tend to and also
 
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's just they naturally change jobs
 
03:12:16.490 --> 03:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
more often that's true in Private
 
03:12:19.250 --> 03:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
Industry and for the state it's a kind
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
of maybe a different culture you can
 
03:12:23.090 --> 03:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
think it's good you can think it's bad
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
but um they're doing it and so this bill
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know stops the situation where
 
03:12:31.490 --> 03:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
um you know we're saying we're giving
 
03:12:34.010 --> 03:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
them these contributions
 
03:12:36.410 --> 03:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
um but if over half of them end up
 
03:12:38.090 --> 03:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
leaving for whatever reason before
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're vested you know they lose a
 
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
significant part of that retirement fund
 
03:12:45.769 --> 03:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to say just an
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
overall overarching thing is that
 
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know this plan we're talking about
 
03:12:53.630 --> 03:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
is is basically the same kind of plan
 
03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:55.250 align:start position:0%
is is basically the same kind of plan
that

03:12:55.250 --> 03:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
um you know the vast majority of
 
03:12:59.450 --> 03:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are paying them are in and
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
it's you know in general things have
 
03:13:02.450 --> 03:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
moved in that direction and there's
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
benefits to it
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you no I I don't know we'll
 
03:13:09.050 --> 03:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
let a few no I would like to I would
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
like to thank the chair and
 
03:13:12.490 --> 03:13:12.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers thank you I'll
 
03:13:14.410 --> 03:13:14.420 align:start position:0%
yields thank you thank you
 
03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
03:13:18.410 --> 03:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair what I like about
 
03:13:20.210 --> 03:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is it's not putting the
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers on the hook for future
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
Federal inflationary targets that they
 
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
seem to have of 20 or what per year
 
03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's one of the benefits I think so
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
that's where I'd like to go with that
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay Fitzpatrick
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
in theory I support this concept
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
but what I'm narrowing in on is on page
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
3 line 28.
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
contributions by the employer
 
03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
I remember when we discussed this a few
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
weeks ago The Conch the contribution was
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
fairly low does anybody remember what
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
what it's approximately two and a half
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
percent right thank you madam thank you
 
03:14:04.910 --> 03:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair I find that to be much too
 
03:14:08.410 --> 03:14:08.420 align:start position:0%
low personally for for me to support
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
this concept this concept I like
 
03:14:16.130 --> 03:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
but that's just just not exactly I have
 
03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
to say that was a political decision to
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
make the state contribution to this
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system the same as it is to
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
the actual retirement of the other
 
03:14:31.370 --> 03:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
employees under understood so
 
03:14:34.610 --> 03:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
if you think it should be higher I I
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
cannot argue with that but I don't know
 
03:14:39.309 --> 03:14:39.319 align:start position:0%
that you can get the money
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam okay representative
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
Simon and just to address that a little
 
03:14:44.399 --> 03:14:45.349 align:start position:0%
Simon and just to address that a little
bit

03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the benefit that they're accumulating
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
right now as the chair said is based off
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
of that same employer contribution so
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's as close to Apples as apples as you
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
can get yes I think it should be higher
 
03:14:59.450 --> 03:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
myself I think it's a little bit too low
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
um but we aren't shortchanging the
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
employee by using that number either at
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
this particular point in time and this
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
does lead flexibility for them to
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.769 --> 03:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:20.330 --> 03:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I'm not going to
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
support the bill because
 
03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there is not this is not an Apples to
 
03:15:27.469 --> 03:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
Apples comparison I understand that but
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
when you look at the employee as a whole
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill this not really address I
 
03:15:37.490 --> 03:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't think the longevity of employment
 
03:15:40.929 --> 03:15:40.939 align:start position:0%
in the state and things like medical
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
health health care plans are different
 
03:15:45.650 --> 03:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
and there's no mention of health care
 
03:15:49.010 --> 03:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
plans in here I beg to differ
 
03:15:52.370 --> 03:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
it's uh in the amendment yeah yeah on
 
03:15:52.380 --> 03:15:52.730 align:start position:0%
it's uh in the amendment yeah yeah on

03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
1990 line 19 page four okay that is the
 
03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:07.969 align:start position:0%
1990 line 19 page four okay that is the
same

03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh plan that the
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
group one and two state employees are
 
03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
03:16:18.410 --> 03:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
and they it is at their own expense
 
03:16:20.090 --> 03:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl
 
03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:23.750 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl
cases

03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:25.250 --> 03:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to look into that
 
03:16:29.090 --> 03:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
and also um in the in doing the hearing
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the UNH plan
 
03:16:34.130 --> 03:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
for employers and employees was there
 
03:16:36.590 --> 03:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
was that answer during subcommittee does
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
anybody remember that question
 
03:16:40.370 --> 03:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the question was UNH
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
has a defined contribution plan and
 
03:16:49.010 --> 03:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
they've had it for 25 years I believe
 
03:16:50.570 --> 03:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
um they may I don't know the numbers
 
03:16:52.490 --> 03:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
they may be offering more money and to
 
03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:53.330 align:start position:0%
they may be offering more money and to
that

03:16:53.330 --> 03:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
I mean I was going to say what what uh
 
03:16:57.889 --> 03:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said with something
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
else and that is the same money is
 
03:17:02.090 --> 03:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
available to pay their retirement
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
benefits in the two plans now you know
 
03:17:08.450 --> 03:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
we're looking at uh raising the salaries
 
03:17:10.130 --> 03:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
for the employees
 
03:17:12.530 --> 03:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I'd have no objection in either you
 
03:17:15.010 --> 03:17:15.020 align:start position:0%
know in hb2 or in the future
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
as part of the negotiation
 
03:17:21.230 --> 03:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know for contracts with the
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
employees to say we're going to increase
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
the match I mean that would be a
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
decision the legislature of future
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislative legislature could make and
 
03:17:30.650 --> 03:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
that might be a good trade-off to do
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that versus maybe some payroll but
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's we've made it the same so that
 
03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
the same money is available for their
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
retirement in both cases and if we think
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
it should increase we can consider that
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
but not part of this bill and
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
available for the employer to decide to
 
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
increase they can't decrease it but they
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
could increase it without our approval
 
03:17:59.090 --> 03:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
or permission we could mandate it to
 
03:18:02.990 --> 03:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
become higher but it is free for the for
 
03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
the employer to increase
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair I neglected to
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
mention that we did put in on this
 
03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:11.690 align:start position:0%
mention that we did put in on this
amendment

03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:18:15.230 --> 03:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
um that amount or greater so as as part
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
of a contract negotiation without the
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
legislature acting they could offer more
 
03:18:21.170 --> 03:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
but we started with the floors being
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
taking my comment and that's all it is
 
03:18:39.110 --> 03:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm a trained Early Childhood
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
educator and I'm also a real estate
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
broker and language is very very very
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
important to me so if you know me you'll
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
know what my comment is going to be
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's Antiquated language we use it
 
03:18:54.170 --> 03:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature you're referred
 
03:18:57.230 --> 03:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
to as chairman fine with me if it was me
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
I would change it and in the bill I
 
03:19:01.250 --> 03:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
noticed that police officers are
 
03:19:03.410 --> 03:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
referred to as policemen and
 
03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
firefighters are referred to as firemen
 
03:19:08.929 --> 03:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
and it may seem like a small point but
 
03:19:11.230 --> 03:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
come on it's
 
03:19:16.250 --> 03:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
2023 right so I think that a word Smith
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
or an editor should pay attention to
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
this whatever happens to it I know there
 
03:19:23.889 --> 03:19:23.899 align:start position:0%
are terms that are used
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
colloquially and even legally yet I
 
03:19:31.370 --> 03:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
cannot not comment because I think it
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
matters I would just say that the
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
permanent policeman or permanent firemen
 
03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
is the existing language of Statute we
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
have not added it I understand it's
 
03:19:45.050 --> 03:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
there and I
 
03:19:48.050 --> 03:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
if you would like to clean up the
 
03:19:51.889 --> 03:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 100a so that it is
 
03:19:51.899 --> 03:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 100a so that it is
non-sexist

03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
non-sexist
 
03:19:55.730 --> 03:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
I would be delighted and I would vote
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
for it but
 
03:20:00.170 --> 03:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's a fair amount of work Madam chair
 
03:20:01.849 --> 03:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I appreciate
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
that and thanks all for listening and
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
smiling especially representative Simon
 
03:20:06.300 --> 03:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
smiling especially representative Simon
okay

03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:10.490 --> 03:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt no okay
 
03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
I'll just make one comment Madam chair
 
03:20:19.610 --> 03:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
and that is uh this is a Monumental
 
03:20:22.450 --> 03:20:22.460 align:start position:0%
change which has been before this
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislature repeatedly in the past in
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
various different forms and I think it's
 
03:20:32.510 --> 03:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
premature to be leaping from one system
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
to the other without further uh without
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
further investigation and study so I
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting the ought to pass
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative O'Brien do
 
03:20:45.610 --> 03:20:45.620 align:start position:0%
you still have a question
 
03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it was just not a
 
03:20:50.210 --> 03:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
question but just as a thing of uh
 
03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
Clarity group two members uh uh as far
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
as the health insurance that that's
 
03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
as the health insurance that that's
negotiated

03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
03:20:59.929 --> 03:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
you know so it's nothing really that
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
comes out of the blue so just as a point
 
03:21:05.330 --> 03:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
to Clarity on that the same was for
 
03:21:08.510 --> 03:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
state employees right
 
03:21:10.130 --> 03:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
and this wouldn't interfere with that
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah I was just
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
going to say this doesn't address it
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.190 --> 03:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
guard to representative Schmidt's
 
03:21:25.809 --> 03:21:25.819 align:start position:0%
comments the previous attempts were to
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
change almost everyone in the retirement
 
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
system to a defined contribution plan
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
which would have major effects on but
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
because essentially you're closing
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and you're not
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
bringing in new people this simply pulls
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
out a group of people
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
of future employees and it is the group
 
03:21:54.530 --> 03:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
that has the least benefit from being a
 
03:21:56.809 --> 03:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
those plans are by their very nature
 
03:22:03.889 --> 03:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
biased toward long-term employees
 
03:22:06.290 --> 03:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
and the police are long-term employees
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
the fire are long-term employees
 
03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
teachers are long-term employees I mean
 
03:22:13.250 --> 03:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
they all have some attrition at the
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
beginning but once they're there for a
 
03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
couple of years they stay in the system
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
for their career so that the people who
 
03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:22.730 align:start position:0%
for their career so that the people who
retire

03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
retire
 
03:22:25.250 --> 03:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
are retiring after a full career for the
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
most part
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
the employees however are not that way
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are some career employees but
 
03:22:36.530 --> 03:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
there is also a lot of coming and going
 
03:22:40.370 --> 03:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
into State Employment back out of it
 
03:22:40.380 --> 03:22:42.769 align:start position:0%
into State Employment back out of it
because

03:22:42.769 --> 03:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
most of them are in jobs that are
 
03:22:48.130 --> 03:22:48.140 align:start position:0%
similar to jobs for with other employers
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore they don't stick around as
 
03:22:54.769 --> 03:22:54.779 align:start position:0%
long and the turnover statistics show
 
03:22:54.779 --> 03:22:55.849 align:start position:0%
long and the turnover statistics show
that

03:22:55.849 --> 03:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
I mean there are very few relatively
 
03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
speaking people who survive the first 10
 
03:23:05.929 --> 03:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
years in order to get the benefit and
 
03:23:05.939 --> 03:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
years in order to get the benefit and
even

03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:23:10.370 --> 03:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
after that they don't stay for the 30 or
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
40 years you need to get a solid pension
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
and so that's one reason to pull those
 
03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
people out of the Divine Benefit Plan
 
03:23:19.859 --> 03:23:23.570 align:start position:0%
people out of the Divine Benefit Plan
foreign

03:23:23.570 --> 03:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so over the course of this
 
03:23:27.410 --> 03:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
term we've heard a lot about the
 
03:23:28.969 --> 03:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
retirement system and we've had a lot of
 
03:23:28.979 --> 03:23:30.349 align:start position:0%
retirement system and we've had a lot of
testimonies

03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
testimonies
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was said to me
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
clearly was that the employees of the
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
state has lost have lost trust in the
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
retirement system and they've lost the
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
trust because frankly of all the changes
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
that are going on at the at the hand of
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
to address that we passed house bill
 
03:23:50.700 --> 03:23:52.490 align:start position:0%
to address that we passed house bill
436.

03:23:52.490 --> 03:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
436.
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
addresses the con the concern and the
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
trust that the employees have in our
 
03:24:01.560 --> 03:24:02.690 align:start position:0%
trust that the employees have in our
system

03:24:02.690 --> 03:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I think frankly that is enough I
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
think continuing to change the return
 
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
system is a bad idea
 
03:24:12.889 --> 03:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
and although
 
03:24:12.899 --> 03:24:14.389 align:start position:0%
and although
um

03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:16.690 --> 03:24:16.700 align:start position:0%
there may be some
 
03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
Concepts that are
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable in this bill I don't want to
 
03:24:23.570 --> 03:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
change anymore I don't want to make any
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
more changes I think we should stay
 
03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
where we are I think employee trust is
 
03:24:28.260 --> 03:24:29.389 align:start position:0%
where we are I think employee trust is
important

03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:24:31.309 --> 03:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that
 
03:24:31.319 --> 03:24:32.690 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that
by

03:24:32.690 --> 03:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
addressing the concerns that we did
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
address in hospital 40 through 436
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
we take care of that this is different
 
03:24:44.030 --> 03:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
and all this data about retention we
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any of that none of that was
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
shared with us and it's not a criticism
 
03:24:49.969 --> 03:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
of this committee but I think that
 
03:24:52.010 --> 03:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
before we do something like this
 
03:24:53.450 --> 03:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
we need to have all the information
 
03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
together so that was at the public
 
03:24:56.220 --> 03:24:57.410 align:start position:0%
together so that was at the public
hearing

03:24:57.410 --> 03:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:24:57.420 --> 03:25:00.349 align:start position:0%
hearing
representative

03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:03.530 --> 03:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
sorry excuse me for interrupting
 
03:25:05.090 --> 03:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against the amendment
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
and against the bill
 
03:25:07.560 --> 03:25:08.809 align:start position:0%
and against the bill
okay

03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
what's up Simon
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:12.530 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the concerns about the
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
trustworthiness of the system I'm a
 
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on 436 and I've
 
03:25:20.450 --> 03:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
been fighting fairly diligently to get
 
03:25:23.090 --> 03:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:25:24.590 --> 03:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:28.010 --> 03:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I do feel like this particular bill is
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different and that it
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't retroactively touch people who
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
are already in the system we're not
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
changing a benefit on somebody who has
 
03:25:37.729 --> 03:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
already started receiving a benefit
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
whereas already working towards a
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
benefit everyone will get what was
 
03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
promised to them when they started
 
03:25:46.729 --> 03:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
employment so I don't feel that it
 
03:25:49.490 --> 03:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
should be an issue of eroding the trust
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
of people in the retirement system
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
because as I said people are going to
 
03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
get what was promised to them when they
 
03:25:58.610 --> 03:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
decided to to sign on the dotted line
 
03:25:59.809 --> 03:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
with their time
 
03:26:02.090 --> 03:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else okay
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
well in that case the motion is to adopt
 
03:26:13.250 --> 03:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0905 H to House Bill 559
 
03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
point of order uh Madam chair yes uh at
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
this particular time may I ask uh
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
Democratic leader would it be to our
 
03:26:25.130 --> 03:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
benefit to have a very quick caucus if
 
03:26:27.830 --> 03:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the chairs are granted of only five
 
03:26:31.010 --> 03:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
minutes to discuss this
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you think you need to it you can have
 
03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:35.389 align:start position:0%
if you think you need to it you can have
a

03:26:35.389 --> 03:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:37.309 --> 03:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
you I'll leave it up to my leadership
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine we can run across this Hub
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be back before five so if they're
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats can us go across the hall to
 
03:26:46.190 --> 03:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
the other room
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
not before five o'clock
 
03:26:53.090 --> 03:26:53.100 align:start position:0%

03:27:13.630 --> 03:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's mine yeah

03:27:18.180 --> 03:27:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.060 --> 03:33:31.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:33:31.809 --> 03:33:31.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.769 --> 03:33:33.779 align:start position:0%

03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
all right are there any further comments
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%

03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
been enlightened
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
03:33:56.210 --> 03:33:56.220 align:start position:0%

03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are amendments and there are
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
changes to this bill that could be made
 
03:35:37.250 --> 03:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
but I think it needs review
 
03:35:37.260 --> 03:35:38.690 align:start position:0%
but I think it needs review
and

03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:39.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
retaining that bill would allow that to
 
03:35:42.239 --> 03:35:44.090 align:start position:0%
retaining that bill would allow that to
happen

03:35:44.090 --> 03:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gould
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
I just uh will repeat what I said about
 
03:35:50.450 --> 03:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
a bill recently I do think with a little
 
03:35:53.450 --> 03:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
work this could could um get pushed
 
03:35:53.460 --> 03:35:55.090 align:start position:0%
work this could could um get pushed
through

03:35:55.090 --> 03:35:55.100 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:36:00.050 --> 03:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:36:03.710 --> 03:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
um I think what representative groat
 
03:36:10.010 --> 03:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
says is true we've had I think a total
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
of four possibly five amendments
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
presented to this bill in the brief time
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
that we've had it and I think that's a
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
pretty big indication that some more
 
03:36:23.090 --> 03:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done on it to look at
 
03:36:27.050 --> 03:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.690 --> 03:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative I'll just make one
 
03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
comment in regard to that most of them
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
were due to all us
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
I mean getting the bill on the morning
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying there weren't changes but
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
getting the first draft on the morning
 
03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
when the deadline was at noon and uh and
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
then them generating amendments which
 
03:36:48.889 --> 03:36:48.899 align:start position:0%
were not what we wanted and finally we
 
03:36:50.690 --> 03:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
went off ourselves and wrote The
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
Language up to give them because they
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
weren't doing what we asked them to do
 
03:36:54.120 --> 03:37:03.010 align:start position:0%
weren't doing what we asked them to do
that's

03:37:03.010 --> 03:37:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I will just say that that was
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
indeed part of the issue the committee
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
had to look at it quickly and and start
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
looking at it and like I said I I just
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
think that the timing was awfully fast
 
03:37:21.429 --> 03:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.290 --> 03:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to retain House Bill
 
03:37:35.880 --> 03:37:37.790 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to retain House Bill
559

03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
559
 
03:37:40.729 --> 03:37:40.739 align:start position:0%

yes 2809
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay that is to retain and we do not
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
need a committee report
 
03:38:29.819 --> 03:38:32.410 align:start position:0%
need a committee report
you

03:38:32.410 --> 03:38:32.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
all right that ends our executive
 
03:38:34.979 --> 03:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
all right that ends our executive
session

03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.080 --> 03:38:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:38:43.370 --> 03:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.380 --> 03:38:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
moving on to the work session I have a
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
number of copies of house bill 2. I got
 
03:38:52.729 --> 03:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
all of the ones they had printed
 
03:38:54.889 --> 03:38:54.899 align:start position:0%
therefore there's not enough to go
 
03:38:54.899 --> 03:38:58.370 align:start position:0%
therefore there's not enough to go
around

03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm serious if you you can share or if
 
03:39:05.570 --> 03:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
you're not really going to read it just
 
03:39:21.910 --> 03:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Greg
 
03:39:26.939 --> 03:39:28.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Greg
probably

03:39:28.490 --> 03:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
excellent then again if you don't need
 
03:39:41.760 --> 03:39:46.190 align:start position:0%
excellent then again if you don't need
one

03:39:46.190 --> 03:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:48.239 --> 03:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you

03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:57.290 --> 03:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
there's one there too okay you somebody
 
03:40:14.210 --> 03:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.220 --> 03:40:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
we there we go all right thank you for
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
your service
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 came out
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
much later than usual
 
03:40:32.090 --> 03:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I was asked by the chair of Finance
 
03:40:35.690 --> 03:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
to look at the section dealing with oplc
 
03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
reorganization which starts on page 90.
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:49.250 --> 03:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh we had a hearing on what we thought
 
03:40:51.410 --> 03:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
was in-house not a hearing a work
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
session on what we thought was in-house
 
03:40:58.610 --> 03:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
bill 2. and talked a number of people
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
gave us a bunch of information
 
03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh when we
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.439 --> 03:41:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
Wednesday

03:41:11.150 --> 03:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
we agreed that we wanted the rear we
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want anything that was in House
 
03:41:18.849 --> 03:41:18.859 align:start position:0%
Bill 655
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
duplicated in House Bill 2 because first
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
we liked our language better and
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
secondly we didn't want to try to keep
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
two very similar bills synchronized
 
03:41:34.250 --> 03:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
so I did some triage on House Bill 2
 
03:41:43.849 --> 03:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
Base by I read it I looked at these the
 
03:41:47.330 --> 03:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
back end and so what I'm going to
 
03:41:51.410 --> 03:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
suggest to finance is first to take out
 
03:41:54.130 --> 03:41:54.140 align:start position:0%
everything from
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh page 90 line four
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
through Page 110 line 28.
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
which is a duplication
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
in concept at least
 
03:42:08.700 --> 03:42:10.250 align:start position:0%
in concept at least
of

03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:42:16.010 --> 03:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
no it's not like I'm I'm wrong excuse me
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
bless you bless you it's only through
 
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
Page 102 line 30. which is the part
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
about the oplc organization so I'm going
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
to recommend they take that completely
 
03:42:33.180 --> 03:42:34.130 align:start position:0%
to recommend they take that completely
out

03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's already covered in house bill 355.
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
in what I 655 sorry and what I will just
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
say thanks to this committee is a much
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
better way of doing it so we'll take I
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
want to recommend all of that
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh what else did I do I'm sorry you said
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
well actually it's it's uh
 
03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's section 285.
 
03:43:12.420 --> 03:43:14.450 align:start position:0%
it's section 285.
through

03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
through
286

03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative that seems to be a
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot shorter than 655 what happened
 
03:43:24.110 --> 03:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on we added a fair amount
 
03:43:27.769 --> 03:43:27.779 align:start position:0%
of of stuff let's see
 
03:43:31.010 --> 03:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
this is the same as this covers the same
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
stat sections of Statute that are the
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
first part of House Bill 655. the
 
03:43:41.809 --> 03:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
amendment deleted the remaining 30 pages
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
or so of uh repeals
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the case but it
 
03:43:50.929 --> 03:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
expanded some of the
 
03:43:50.939 --> 03:43:52.070 align:start position:0%
expanded some of the
um

03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
some of the sections like the inspection
 
03:43:57.889 --> 03:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
the investigations were expanded
 
03:43:57.899 --> 03:43:59.269 align:start position:0%
the investigations were expanded
but

03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
these these sections create the same
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
rsas that we created in
 
03:44:11.210 --> 03:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if I may so I do I do
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
believe that um we do start with a page
 
03:44:20.690 --> 03:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
90 right in in the in because I created
 
03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment and we went all the way to
 
03:44:29.050 --> 03:44:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with you because I'm looking at
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
this and I'm thinking there's only 12
 
03:44:37.729 --> 03:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
pages in House Bill 655 is I believe 17
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
or 18 pages long so I will make sure
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'll just double check but I know that
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
well I that represent uh chair Maguire
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I have had several conversations
 
03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
about this um
 
03:44:55.570 --> 03:44:55.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the bill and so
 
03:44:58.610 --> 03:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
I can also say that
 
03:45:00.190 --> 03:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
I know this sounds
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
unlikely but
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
there are the different page lengths on
 
03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:07.790 align:start position:0%
there are the different page lengths on
these

03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
on these bills so sometimes what you see
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
on a PDF form is different than what you
 
03:45:14.330 --> 03:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
see in real life which is different than
 
03:45:17.090 --> 03:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
what you see on the general ledger I
 
03:45:19.490 --> 03:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
mean the general court website which has
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
led to a lot of confusion as far as page
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
numbers go all right thank you yeah but
 
03:45:26.450 --> 03:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
I will double check that because I have
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
the same question I'm pretty sure that
 
03:45:31.969 --> 03:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
all of that needs to come out and I I
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
would not be surprised there are some
 
03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
other section that also wants to come
 
03:45:37.190 --> 03:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
out but
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so what else did I do here
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
um reading through
 
03:45:47.150 --> 03:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
on the Auctioneers
 
03:45:49.250 --> 03:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I deleted
 
03:45:53.290 --> 03:45:53.300 align:start position:0%
page 110 that's how I got there
 
03:45:53.300 --> 03:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
page 110 that's how I got there
delete

03:45:55.190 --> 03:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
delete
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
section 311
 
03:45:57.840 --> 03:45:59.150 align:start position:0%
section 311
which

03:45:59.150 --> 03:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
says that the executive director will
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
not issue a
 
03:46:06.349 --> 03:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
certificate of incorporation well that's
 
03:46:09.170 --> 03:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
not her business that's the Secretary of
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
State's job and so if we delete this
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
we it's the second it'll stay in statute
 
03:46:22.729 --> 03:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
where it is now with as the uh
 
03:46:25.130 --> 03:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
um as the Secretary of State's
 
03:46:25.140 --> 03:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
um as the Secretary of State's
responsibility

03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
so you're going to delete that whole
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph yeah
 
03:46:35.150 --> 03:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other things on page 152
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
where it talks about regulation of
 
03:46:44.030 --> 03:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
massage therapists massage
 
03:46:44.040 --> 03:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
massage therapists massage
establishments

03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh there and on the next couple of pages
 
03:46:52.849 --> 03:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
or actually I took out the licensure of
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
massage establishments because that's
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the house physician
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 341 which required the
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
license of establishments was killed so
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
the house position is they don't need a
 
03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
license and I don't want it to be snuck
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
in here
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of places on those
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
two pages where I delete the reference
 
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
to a
 
03:47:21.190 --> 03:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so is that section we're going to
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
get rid of 421 422 423 through I don't
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
know what 425 uh
 
03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:32.030 align:start position:0%
know what 425 uh
okay

03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:34.250 --> 03:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
there's a number of places where we take
 
03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
that out and what we're just deleting
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
The Establishment part absolutely the
 
03:47:42.650 --> 03:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change the uh
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
um the reason this is here is they're
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
combining the reflexologist and
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
structural integrators and Asian body
 
03:47:51.530 --> 03:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
work therapy into the board of Massage
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
Therapy which is not
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't sound like a problem
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm chair I just want to so that
 
03:48:04.729 --> 03:48:04.739 align:start position:0%
everybody is clear this bill is not our
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill it belongs to the house finance so
 
03:48:10.250 --> 03:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that everyone
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
knows that our Visa recommendations so
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
that if some of these things don't
 
03:48:17.150 --> 03:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
happen we don't have everybody coming to
 
03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
our door and saying yeah you understand
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying this is a recommendation
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
to finance which they may or may not
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
adopt I understand that it will be in
 
03:48:29.210 --> 03:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments to House Bill too
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
and they may adopt some but not all this
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
one since we have established a house
 
03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:36.050 align:start position:0%
one since we have established a house
position

03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:48:40.370 --> 03:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
in by killing House Bill 341 I strongly
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.250 --> 03:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
I would think they would be likely to
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
anything that lightens their loads
 
03:48:48.239 --> 03:48:51.889 align:start position:0%
anything that lightens their loads
absolutely

03:48:51.889 --> 03:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.899 --> 03:48:55.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:48:55.150 --> 03:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.650 --> 03:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
Along on page
 
03:48:57.660 --> 03:49:00.710 align:start position:0%
Along on page
189

03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
they're deleting the governor has
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
suggested the leading release the
 
03:49:12.130 --> 03:49:12.140 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure that that's what we
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
should do but
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
the changes that I'm recommending are
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
when we that they should not have a
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant on the board
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
if there is no such thing
 
03:49:35.150 --> 03:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:36.779 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't want to take a position
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
on whether or not LNA should be licensed
 
03:49:42.410 --> 03:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think that that needs to be addressed
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
but I can't do it I just want to make
 
03:49:47.690 --> 03:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
sure that if it is being deleted we
 
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't try to put one on the board
 
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
just for just for clarity yes
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:49:57.530 --> 03:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so if you recall
 
03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh because you were there that day uh
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
when we had the work session on uh 655
 
03:50:10.130 --> 03:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
over in the next work area
 
03:50:10.140 --> 03:50:10.910 align:start position:0%
over in the next work area
um

03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:12.769 --> 03:50:12.779 align:start position:0%
there was a news release that was put
 
03:50:15.010 --> 03:50:15.020 align:start position:0%
out by director Courtney
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh about the changes that that were
 
03:50:21.530 --> 03:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor there were a
 
03:50:24.650 --> 03:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
series of boards that were combined in
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
one section uh there were Sears at the
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
very end of the news releases I recall
 
03:50:33.050 --> 03:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
03:50:33.060 --> 03:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
with regard to
um

03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
professions and occupations that were
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed and there were a
 
03:50:41.809 --> 03:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
couple of other changes so that is a
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
useful document to work for us to work
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
from in in this regard I believe but one
 
03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
of the aspects and that's why I'm
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
speaking at this particular moment was
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
the LNA situation as you may know
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh our nursing homes uh employ a large
 
03:51:01.190 --> 03:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
number of lnas they are crucial
 
03:51:03.769 --> 03:51:03.779 align:start position:0%
employees in the situation because even
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
though they do not do the kind of thing
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
that nurses do there as a matter of fact
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing many things that
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
nurses do but they're absolutely vital
 
03:51:15.650 --> 03:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
employees uh and I think it could be
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
terribly disruptive to the uh
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
functioning of our nursing homes both
 
03:51:23.710 --> 03:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
public and private County and non-county
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
to have the licenses taken out from
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
underneath uh Alanis at this time so I
 
03:51:33.410 --> 03:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that we
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
should not do the the board member
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
aspect is I think is not insignificant
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
but I think that de-licensing you know
 
03:51:46.190 --> 03:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
deregulating lnas would be
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so I think I certainly
 
03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
hope we will not do that well that's
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
something the I would like to comment
 
03:51:57.050 --> 03:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
that nursing is distance must be on the
 
03:51:59.570 --> 03:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant registry which is a
 
03:52:02.090 --> 03:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
federal registry of certified nursing
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
assistants they they're registered and
 
03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:07.990 align:start position:0%
assistants they they're registered and
uh

03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
that is one of the requirements to be an
 
03:52:14.809 --> 03:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
LNA I think getting into that issue uh
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
is is will take a lot of time uh and so
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
I I I just think that this news release
 
03:52:25.250 --> 03:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh we if we could pull it up uh and I've
 
03:52:27.290 --> 03:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
already taken steps to see if we can get
 
03:52:29.090 --> 03:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
some copies because it's a very good
 
03:52:31.370 --> 03:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
diagram well okay well
 
03:52:31.380 --> 03:52:32.110 align:start position:0%
diagram well okay well
um

03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:34.010 --> 03:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:52:36.889 --> 03:52:36.899 align:start position:0%
I'm right now presenting my triage of
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
the things that I thought were urgent
 
03:52:42.050 --> 03:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
that making sure that the board was this
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
I will definitely say that the LNA
 
03:52:46.510 --> 03:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
licensure is something that needs
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
investigation but I I think that you
 
03:52:52.130 --> 03:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
know one of the things I'm sure will be
 
03:52:54.530 --> 03:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
of interest to the people who are who've
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
stayed even after we did the the heavy
 
03:53:02.450 --> 03:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
lift uh of um of the previous bill
 
03:53:04.969 --> 03:53:04.979 align:start position:0%
um they're they're all here I bet you
 
03:53:07.190 --> 03:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's have more than a passing
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
interest in all these repeals uh just
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
just a hypothesis I spent a couple years
 
03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
in college you're probably right but
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
as I said this is not our bill all we
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
can do is recommend I was asked to do
 
03:53:22.080 --> 03:53:23.809 align:start position:0%
can do is recommend I was asked to do
some

03:53:23.809 --> 03:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:53:28.729 --> 03:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
some of the analysis and so I'll let
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
I've got a couple more Post-its that
 
03:53:32.809 --> 03:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
I'll go through and I'll open up to
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee that have
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that may not be this
 
03:53:39.359 --> 03:53:40.690 align:start position:0%
concerns that may not be this
well

03:53:40.690 --> 03:53:40.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:53:43.969 --> 03:53:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's true that this is not our bill but
 
03:53:47.090 --> 03:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
this specific part of the bill is our
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
field of expertise in This House of
 
03:53:52.010 --> 03:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives many of us have worked
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
at this in the labored in this Vineyard
 
03:53:57.250 --> 03:53:57.260 align:start position:0%
for a number of years so uh
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we have had
 
03:54:05.090 --> 03:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.849 --> 03:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
not only de-licensing but just as just
 
03:54:10.130 --> 03:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
as one example and I know there's one of
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
the people here who's specifically
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
interested in this
 
03:54:15.769 --> 03:54:15.779 align:start position:0%
combination of some boards this
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
Committee in previous go around
 
03:54:22.210 --> 03:54:22.220 align:start position:0%
when we were combining boards or or
 
03:54:25.490 --> 03:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
uncombining boards to be specific
 
03:54:28.250 --> 03:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh spoke with representative Weiler you
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
know earlier today
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
and brought to his attention that he
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
asked him whether he had
 
03:54:35.640 --> 03:54:36.229 align:start position:0%
asked him whether he had
um

03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
seen that the the board of Mental Health
 
03:54:44.330 --> 03:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
practice uh was going to be combined
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
with Board of science of psychology
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:54:52.729 --> 03:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
um he brought us a bill roughly 10 years
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
ago to remove the board of psychologists
 
03:54:57.849 --> 03:54:57.859 align:start position:0%
from Board of mental health practice
 
03:55:00.830 --> 03:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay and so putting it back together
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
again undoes the the work that we that
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
we did 10 years ago that's the kind of
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
thing that I think we should say no way
 
03:55:11.450 --> 03:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to say one thing
 
03:55:17.150 --> 03:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
recognize and thank you for the effort
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
that you have put in House Bill 2 and
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of Agony that it takes to go
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
through this line by line so I don't
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
want that to be unsaid thank you you're
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
welcome and I admit that there were
 
03:55:35.929 --> 03:55:35.939 align:start position:0%
areas that I looked at and said okay
 
03:55:37.490 --> 03:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's what the governor wants I'm not
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to argue with them the the next
 
03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to to mention is
 
03:55:44.100 --> 03:55:46.490 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to to mention is
that

03:55:46.490 --> 03:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
um based on a discussion with director
 
03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
Courtney we would change the effective
 
03:55:56.090 --> 03:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
date of the oplc changes until September
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's new it would be on page
 
03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:01.429 align:start position:0%
it's new it would be on page
217.

03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
217.
 
03:56:03.490 --> 03:56:03.500 align:start position:0%
it says unless otherwise specified
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's where you put in that we're
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise specifying
 
03:56:11.809 --> 03:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
in that same area I would put it want to
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
put in any holder of a license that is
 
03:56:17.570 --> 03:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
repealed by this act shall be refunded
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
the license fee because it's unfair
 
03:56:19.859 --> 03:56:24.550 align:start position:0%
the license fee because it's unfair
otherwise

03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.969 --> 03:56:28.979 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I did was to
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
decide that the Landscape Architects
 
03:56:35.450 --> 03:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
Foresters soil scientists and Wetland
 
03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:36.950 align:start position:0%
Foresters soil scientists and Wetland
scientists

03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed be
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
if for no other reason that we have
 
03:56:48.050 --> 03:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
required their license or their stamp
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
in innumerable places in our statutes in
 
03:56:55.490 --> 03:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
the Des rules in particular and in town
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
and planning board type rules
 
03:56:58.800 --> 03:57:01.070 align:start position:0%
and planning board type rules
um

03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
if we want to eliminate those licenses
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to go through and
 
03:57:09.170 --> 03:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
fix all of those references
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes yes just a slight note
 
03:57:20.090 --> 03:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
on that that uh was it the soil
 
03:57:22.130 --> 03:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
scientist or the Wetland scientists are
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
certified and not licensed so just
 
03:57:25.969 --> 03:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
making sure that that's a matter of
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
language they call themselves certified
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
but in in essence it's a license because
 
03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:57:36.590 --> 03:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
get the stamp and and sign the the
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
documents without it
 
03:57:39.239 --> 03:57:40.370 align:start position:0%
documents without it
um

03:57:40.370 --> 03:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
03:57:42.779 --> 03:57:44.389 align:start position:0%
so there's
uh

03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:48.530 --> 03:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
two ways we can do it we can either
 
03:57:52.250 --> 03:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
just delete the sections where those are
 
03:57:56.689 --> 03:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
those professions are repealed or what I
 
03:57:58.729 --> 03:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
started to do was to combine the board
 
03:58:00.889 --> 03:58:00.899 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Professional Engineers
 
03:58:00.899 --> 03:58:03.710 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Professional Engineers
because

03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
all of those professions are somewhat
 
03:58:06.600 --> 03:58:08.410 align:start position:0%
all of those professions are somewhat
related

03:58:08.410 --> 03:58:08.420 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
they work together on a great many
 
03:58:11.160 --> 03:58:12.710 align:start position:0%
they work together on a great many
projects

03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
projects
 
03:58:15.110 --> 03:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they're all exceedingly well behaved
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
they do not get very many complaints
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's not too many investigations the
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
boards really don't have a lot to do
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons why they
 
03:58:27.530 --> 03:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
were targeted without
 
03:58:30.170 --> 03:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
on a first brush approach to who will
 
03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
have made the license so I've been
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
working on trying to combine the the
 
03:58:38.450 --> 03:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
board the board to make one technical
 
03:58:38.460 --> 03:58:39.769 align:start position:0%
board the board to make one technical
board

03:58:39.769 --> 03:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
and keep the same requirements for
 
03:58:44.269 --> 03:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
licensure or certification or whatever
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
you want to call it and all the same
 
03:58:50.570 --> 03:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
exemptions which are basically no
 
03:58:53.150 --> 03:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
employee needs to be licensed
 
03:58:53.160 --> 03:58:54.710 align:start position:0%
employee needs to be licensed
uh

03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:57.530 --> 03:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
if you're an employee of the state or
 
03:58:57.540 --> 03:58:59.210 align:start position:0%
if you're an employee of the state or
the

03:58:59.210 --> 03:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:59.220 --> 03:59:00.170 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:59:00.170 --> 03:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
federal government doing that kind of
 
03:59:02.160 --> 03:59:04.309 align:start position:0%
federal government doing that kind of
work

03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:59:06.130 --> 03:59:06.140 align:start position:0%
on your own land you don't need it
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects in particular only
 
03:59:11.929 --> 03:59:11.939 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed to do perform
 
03:59:15.050 --> 03:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
landscape architecture if their client
 
03:59:17.929 --> 03:59:17.939 align:start position:0%
requires it which is essentially Federal
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
Federal funded jobs like I-93 which is
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
why we created the license in the first
 
03:59:23.520 --> 03:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
why we created the license in the first
place

03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the state doesn't require it and the
 
03:59:30.769 --> 03:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
governor but he's talking about not
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
needing a license to plant a rose bush
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
had not apparently read the statute
 
03:59:37.849 --> 03:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
where it says you don't need a license
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
to plant a rose bush
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
unless of course it's on I-93 in which
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
case all bets are off
 
03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
um so I'm working on combining the
 
03:59:50.929 --> 03:59:50.939 align:start position:0%
boards and
 
03:59:50.939 --> 03:59:52.370 align:start position:0%
boards and
um

03:59:52.370 --> 03:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
if anyone is interested in reviewing
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
what what I've got I'd be glad to share
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
it but what I'd like to do
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
is to see if there's any yes
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative lackas sorry I just was
 
04:00:07.729 --> 04:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
wondering if I know we're reviewing this
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
and providing suggestions is HHS
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
reviewing any of the medical licensing
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
changes I have no
 
04:00:18.290 --> 04:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes representative I'm
 
04:00:23.330 --> 04:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
assuming that we probably have some of
 
04:00:23.340 --> 04:00:24.309 align:start position:0%
assuming that we probably have some of
those

04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:00:27.769 --> 04:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
landscape artists soil scientists Etc
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
present I was just wondering if you'd
 
04:00:34.490 --> 04:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
want to hear their opinion
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
well actually I they appeared the
 
04:00:39.889 --> 04:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
natural scientists appeared at that
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
previous meeting and they convinced
 
04:00:44.929 --> 04:00:44.939 align:start position:0%
me and everybody else there that they
 
04:00:46.510 --> 04:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
needed a license
 
04:00:50.630 --> 04:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
I also got reports in writing that they
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
were willing to be in a joint board
 
04:00:55.370 --> 04:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
rather than a separate board because
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
as I said they're such so well behaved
 
04:01:00.010 --> 04:01:00.020 align:start position:0%
they don't need a lot of board action
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes
 
04:01:06.229 --> 04:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
likewise um or similarly I know that the
 
04:01:08.330 --> 04:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
head of the forestry
 
04:01:12.889 --> 04:01:12.899 align:start position:0%
um not mentioned first he's here and um
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have heard from him
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
yet and I he and I had a chance to speak
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
briefly about combining boards so I I
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
wonder if we might want to hear a little
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
bit from him and and full confession my
 
04:01:26.450 --> 04:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
husband being a retired logger I have an
 
04:01:29.210 --> 04:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
interest in Forrester well no the I
 
04:01:32.990 --> 04:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.050 --> 04:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
have the requirement should be the same
 
04:01:36.060 --> 04:01:38.290 align:start position:0%
have the requirement should be the same
um

04:01:38.290 --> 04:01:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
unless they have an extreme objection to
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
be in a combined board I'm I'm just
 
04:01:45.889 --> 04:01:45.899 align:start position:0%
willing to to uh concentrate on some of
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.450 --> 04:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
I think it's wonderful that there's so
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
many people here who want to speak but
 
04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
before we open it up my recommendation
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
would be that the committee shares their
 
04:02:04.969 --> 04:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the amendment I mean on
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 so that because I had the
 
04:02:09.769 --> 04:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
same question that representative Lucas
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
had last night when I was reading House
 
04:02:15.290 --> 04:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
Bill 2. gee I hope that you know the
 
04:02:15.300 --> 04:02:16.189 align:start position:0%
Bill 2. gee I hope that you know the
other

04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:02:19.010 --> 04:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
um committees are looking into it but at
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
this point we have enough of an apple
 
04:02:23.450 --> 04:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
bite here that
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
um you know and our responsibility and
 
04:02:27.290 --> 04:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
our expertise has to do with what we're
 
04:02:27.300 --> 04:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
our expertise has to do with what we're
addressing

04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we should a limit it to that
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know um we should
 
04:02:35.699 --> 04:02:36.889 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know um we should
all

04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:02:36.899 --> 04:02:37.550 align:start position:0%
all
um

04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure having read this all
 
04:02:42.530 --> 04:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd love to hear what people mean yes
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I that I overlook because I'm sure
 
04:02:46.130 --> 04:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
there are things yes
 
04:02:48.290 --> 04:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Schmidt has
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
brought up the board of mental health
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
practice combined with the psychologists
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
and the licensure of lnas
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
um representative a bear
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
I've heard from my constituents on the
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
um the electricians
 
04:03:05.570 --> 04:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
and also
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the Landscape Architects
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you okay well the what were the
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects had were objecting
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
to their license being removed and we're
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be addressing that what
 
04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
did the electricians concerned about
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
their um their biggest concern is that
 
04:03:30.010 --> 04:03:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
that while they wouldn't be licensed
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
that they understand people would need
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
to accept because there's there's no
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
motion I don't think anybody has an idea
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
to take the electrician's license out I
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything like that has
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh no I I think which you might be
 
04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
talking about is there is a concern
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
about the reciprocity so that's the only
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
concern so I think that the
 
04:04:00.050 --> 04:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
electrician's license is still impacted
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
is not impacted but it's the issue of
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and I'm not sure
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we addressed in House Bill 594
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't it that we that if the
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
requirements the qualifications are
 
04:04:16.689 --> 04:04:16.699 align:start position:0%
similar that they can get them a license
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I know that Maine for example has a
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
non-equivalent license
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct so right now everybody
 
04:04:26.170 --> 04:04:26.180 align:start position:0%
understand correctly I don't remember
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
Reciprocity for electricians being in
 
04:04:32.330 --> 04:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill at least I didn't see it 594.
 
04:04:35.330 --> 04:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 594 which we would correct
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
but not in a house bill too I don't
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
think so no no
 
04:04:43.010 --> 04:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
507 Madam oh okay that's a difference we
 
04:04:45.650 --> 04:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
killed that
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
all right but not yet but that's what's
 
04:04:51.769 --> 04:04:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I I'm I'm jumping to conclusions
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
if I were a betting nominees so yes uh
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
that's a different Bill entirely so you
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
can reassure them that this has nothing
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
to do with that I apologize no no it's
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
there's massive confusion about all
 
04:05:15.889 --> 04:05:15.899 align:start position:0%
these bills representative blackis so um
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 is there any reciprocity
 
04:05:21.290 --> 04:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
language and if so does it conflict with
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
velocity language was in the part that
 
04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're taking out because
 
04:05:31.620 --> 04:05:32.630 align:start position:0%
we're taking out because
um

04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:39.410 --> 04:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
that these program
 
04:05:43.680 --> 04:05:44.410 align:start position:0%
that these program
um

04:05:44.410 --> 04:05:44.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's yes it's in the set it's in on
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
page 94 and I believe yes
 
04:05:52.260 --> 04:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
page 94 and I believe yes
okay

04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:54.000 --> 04:05:59.050 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:05:59.050 --> 04:05:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
that is talks about temporary and
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
permanent licenses to out-of-state
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
but that's being removed from House Bill
 
04:06:07.920 --> 04:06:08.750 align:start position:0%
but that's being removed from House Bill
too

04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:15.050 --> 04:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay there is one if I may there are so
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
the section that I was concerned about
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
had to do with the Mental Health Board
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
and I think that that takes a lot of
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
work to untangle so I was wondering if
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
we could pull that out and work on that
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
as part of a non-germaine Amendment
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
is that something that the committee
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
wants to recommend we pull out of house
 
04:06:45.410 --> 04:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill too and we dig into it yes
 
04:06:46.969 --> 04:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
those are those in favor raise your
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
hands if you believe it's nice
 
04:06:51.840 --> 04:06:53.050 align:start position:0%
hands if you believe it's nice
tools

04:06:53.050 --> 04:06:53.060 align:start position:0%

04:06:53.060 --> 04:06:54.410 align:start position:0%
tools
[Music]

[Music]
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
well that's the majority right there
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
even if it's not unimannonymous all
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
right so let's see where they deal with
 
04:07:05.580 --> 04:07:07.189 align:start position:0%
right so let's see where they deal with
that

04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
well oh right right but you don't have
 
04:07:10.969 --> 04:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
to get you don't have to do I mean you
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
know there are workhorses on the
 
04:07:15.050 --> 04:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
committee that can address that I can
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
see that was the if that was keeping you
 
04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
from putting your hand up Don't Be
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
Afraid yes yeah well we've been there
 
04:07:20.699 --> 04:07:22.070 align:start position:0%
Afraid yes yeah well we've been there
before

04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:07:24.650 --> 04:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's no blurb required by anybody on
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
any of these things
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
um where's the oh that's the the board
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
of mental health practice it's on page I
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
just had this it's 100 oh God it's a big
 
04:07:37.969 --> 04:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
one it's a big one that's why I was
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
04:07:40.849 --> 04:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
Peter lishman will thank you they love
 
04:07:47.689 --> 04:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
to get big repeals and guns yes it
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.620 --> 04:07:57.530 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
where does it end
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um hang on Long Way
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
we could kind of assign a couple of
 
04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
people to look at this while a couple of
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
other people absolutely on the committee
 
04:08:14.090 --> 04:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
look at the the merge boards situation
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board of reflexology
 
04:08:19.729 --> 04:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
structural integration and Asian body
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
work therapy with Advisory Board of
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
Massage Therapy to become The Advisory
 
04:08:28.729 --> 04:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
Board of massage therapists and so forth
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is something that we also
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
specifically took apart about 12 years
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
ago okay excuse me Peter we haven't
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
finished with the board of mental health
 
04:08:41.330 --> 04:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying is if if we we don't
 
04:08:44.650 --> 04:08:44.660 align:start position:0%
devote the entire committee on one thing
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
kind of split up a little bit and look
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
at the difference okay so the mental
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
no we're looking at page numbers
 
04:09:05.110 --> 04:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
443 yeah okay yes that's the alcohol
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
other drug that gets 443 not 445 and it
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
goes down to section it's all 445.
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
443 to 445 is all the Mental Health
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
Board issues thank you
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's on page through page
 
04:09:27.000 --> 04:09:30.070 align:start position:0%
thank you that's on page through page
181.

04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes yesterday I started the
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
process of starting a mental health
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
caucus so I would be very interested in
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
being one of the people
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
we'll let you uh
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
take a lead on that one draft as many
 
04:09:48.290 --> 04:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
people as you can Peter I'm sure it also
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
could be that there's some people in the
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
audience who are well familiar with the
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
section of
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital too that we are
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
considering deleting here and so forth
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
so enlisting their assistance might be
 
04:10:05.399 --> 04:10:07.849 align:start position:0%
so enlisting their assistance might be
helpful

04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely we will we'll have
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
to look at that okay and
 
04:10:15.359 --> 04:10:19.210 align:start position:0%
to look at that okay and
um

04:10:19.210 --> 04:10:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's a significant there's it's there
 
04:10:25.010 --> 04:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
are some some pages in this legislation
 
04:10:25.020 --> 04:10:26.269 align:start position:0%
are some some pages in this legislation
that's

04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill that refers to the guardian
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
ad litem
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm not as familiar and up and up on
 
04:10:35.570 --> 04:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
that as
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
one should be
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I will take it I don't I'm not going
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
to recommend that we do anything with
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
this in this bill but I will I will take
 
04:10:45.840 --> 04:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
this in this bill but I will I will take
a

04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%

item will
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
might possibly need to come out but
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%

04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
they think that they think
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
really ought to be pulled out of house
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
bill too
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%

all right
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the board of mental health practice
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
is a is a major rewrite
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%

04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
some concerns about one issue on that
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%

04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
there's no firemen in here
 
04:12:26.450 --> 04:12:26.460 align:start position:0%

04:12:59.689 --> 04:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
tell me what I'm I'm
 
04:13:02.809 --> 04:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
ah for some reason the mechanical
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.239 --> 04:13:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
has traditionally been in the department
 
04:13:12.889 --> 04:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
of safety under the control of the state
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal what this section does is
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
it moves the
 
04:13:23.210 --> 04:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
oversight of the board from the fire
 
04:13:23.220 --> 04:13:24.410 align:start position:0%
oversight of the board from the fire
marshal

04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
marshal
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
to the oplc
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
it um doesn't look like it changes
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
if I can yes Representatives yeah I
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
think I mean I may be misinterpreted but
 
04:13:38.150 --> 04:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
I've seen a number of sections where
 
04:13:38.160 --> 04:13:38.929 align:start position:0%
I've seen a number of sections where
it's

04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:13:41.150 --> 04:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
you know the rule making regarding fees
 
04:13:42.530 --> 04:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
and certainly you know this list of
 
04:13:44.929 --> 04:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
things because those functions as I
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand are we moved into oplc bodies
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that's being done for most of the
 
04:13:49.680 --> 04:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
so that's being done for most of the
boards

04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
so some of the things they're doing now
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
moving solo PLC but the board still
 
04:13:55.490 --> 04:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
exists yeah
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah this this the board still exists it
 
04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
still has the
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
um they don't get to set fees or
 
04:14:04.969 --> 04:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
penalties and the handle expiration
 
04:14:09.370 --> 04:14:09.380 align:start position:0%
renewal is oplc but they're still
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
reviewing educational programs
 
04:14:15.729 --> 04:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
conducting disciplinary hearings
 
04:14:19.130 --> 04:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
technical standards and future changes
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
but I think the disciplinary action then
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
is back to oplc
 
04:14:23.699 --> 04:14:26.210 align:start position:0%
is back to oplc
right

04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.110 --> 04:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
but that but they they as is described
 
04:14:34.849 --> 04:14:34.859 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 655 the board is the
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
the judge or jury whichever you would
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
want to consider it the jury of their
 
04:14:39.239 --> 04:14:40.610 align:start position:0%
want to consider it the jury of their
peers

04:14:40.610 --> 04:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
peers
 
04:14:42.650 --> 04:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I ask what the deadline
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
is to get this reviewed ah well
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's a very interesting question I'm
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible the
 
04:15:00.290 --> 04:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
if you want to suggest major changes
 
04:15:02.689 --> 04:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
other than to the sections we've agreed
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
to pull out
 
04:15:04.080 --> 04:15:06.590 align:start position:0%
to pull out
then

04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
next week maybe but you would have to
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.520 --> 04:15:15.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
one most likely
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
yeah most of the stuff is in division
 
04:15:20.399 --> 04:15:22.309 align:start position:0%
yeah most of the stuff is in division
one

04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:15:22.319 --> 04:15:23.630 align:start position:0%
one
yes

04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking is
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that maybe the committee
 
04:15:28.800 --> 04:15:29.630 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that maybe the committee
should

04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:15:31.610 --> 04:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
be all together
 
04:15:34.010 --> 04:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking that it might be a good
 
04:15:38.150 --> 04:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
idea to summarize
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
what we have come what the discussion
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
has been and if you want me to take a
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
stab at that I'd love to have it thank
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
04:15:48.650 --> 04:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
so this is where I think we are and
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
everybody should be listening
 
04:15:53.330 --> 04:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt representative
 
04:15:53.340 --> 04:15:54.490 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt representative
Schmidt

04:15:54.490 --> 04:15:54.500 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
I would like to have the floor
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I think what um where we are now
 
04:16:04.729 --> 04:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.010 --> 04:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
take the sections out that delete the
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
licensure or certification for Landscape
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
Architects for soil scientists for
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
wetland scientists and for Foresters
 
04:16:27.530 --> 04:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
merging that with an with a with an
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
engineering board with one of the
 
04:16:33.410 --> 04:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
technical boards so that's something
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
that we should that's number one number
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
two we're going to take out the Mental
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
Health Board portion of this of hb2
 
04:16:44.330 --> 04:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
these are recommendations that we're
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
04:16:48.769 --> 04:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have us we're going
 
04:16:50.809 --> 04:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
to take a look at
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
what our recommendations would be for
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
mental health boards
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at the guardian ad
 
04:17:02.689 --> 04:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
litem portion of this bill and have and
 
04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
review it and bring my suggestions first
 
04:17:07.969 --> 04:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
I'll bring them to your to the committee
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
I can do that and I can also bring them
 
04:17:12.650 --> 04:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
to division one we're also going to look
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
at I think we're pulling out the
 
04:17:17.929 --> 04:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants to take a
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
look at that and that's Senator Schmidt
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
will take the lead on that yeah so those
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
are the those are the four clumps
 
04:17:27.769 --> 04:17:27.779 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at okay
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
and I and I already have the
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
more mechanical
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
corrections to delete 355 655 and a few
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
other minor correct and I think that
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
that addresses I would say a significant
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
portion of this bill
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to put I wanted to guess all
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
I could feel that we were sort of
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
going off into all different tangents
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I want to bring us back because one
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
of the things about this is that when
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
you have too many conversations at the
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
same time people lose track of what the
 
04:18:07.610 --> 04:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
heck's going on and this is a big beefy
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
thing so I think we should all the the
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
eye on the prize is House Bill 2 right
 
04:18:15.410 --> 04:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
now and I think that we've got those
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
four things actually I'm going to add
 
04:18:22.969 --> 04:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
the house bill 655 removal so that's so
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
I just that's where that's where my head
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
is at and I hope everybody's
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
on the same page I hope that's helpful
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I agree that we
 
04:18:34.859 --> 04:18:37.370 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I agree that we
um

04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.729 --> 04:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
unless there's any comments I will send
 
04:18:40.739 --> 04:18:41.870 align:start position:0%
unless there's any comments I will send
the

04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
small items that I had give them to
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
finance they will probably accept
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
those the the I don't know about the
 
04:18:51.540 --> 04:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
those the the I don't know about the
other

04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
other changes but I would bet they'd be
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
happy to get rid of the board of mental
 
04:18:59.090 --> 04:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
health practice
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
I have a sort of a process question yes
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that'll mean anybody can go to
 
04:19:05.689 --> 04:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
finance and testify and recommend
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
anything but do we as a committee when
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
people go off from work want to get
 
04:19:12.650 --> 04:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
together and review stuff and you know
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
if it's going to have the impromometer
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
of Edna
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
no well I think okay that's fine the
 
04:19:21.530 --> 04:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
decision to take the board of mental
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
health practice merger out of house bill
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
to appears to be the consensus of the
 
04:19:27.359 --> 04:19:28.309 align:start position:0%
to appears to be the consensus of the
committee

04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:19:31.729 --> 04:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
and okay you would like to I just
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at it so I don't have an
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah well I'm not a discipline
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
looked at it our
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
think that it needs a little work I
 
04:19:43.610 --> 04:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
think that the the points that you made
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
today and the points that we made with
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 and removing the health
 
04:19:51.290 --> 04:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
the mental health board and the L A
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
portion are all recommend I'd like to
 
04:19:55.490 --> 04:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
say that these are all recommendations
 
04:19:58.010 --> 04:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
from Edna because we as a board have
 
04:20:01.010 --> 04:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
discussed them but if individually we go
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
and say well you know I think we should
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
do this that's really not
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
representing the committee because you
 
04:20:11.210 --> 04:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss it with us right that's
 
04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yeah that was kind
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
of my point and uh when you say remove
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health and remove
 
04:20:17.040 --> 04:20:18.229 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health and remove
LNA

04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
LNA
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
I mean from House Bill 2 and we would
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
work on that as a committee remember we
 
04:20:27.050 --> 04:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
kept House Bill 518
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
retained it my question was when would
 
04:20:29.340 --> 04:20:30.110 align:start position:0%
retained it my question was when would
this

04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:42.410 --> 04:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.410 --> 04:20:44.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you though that answers
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just trying to get straight
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
04:20:47.939 --> 04:20:49.969 align:start position:0%
in my mind
um

04:20:49.969 --> 04:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a
 
04:20:55.250 --> 04:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
son to uh
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
they think we should address as a full
 
04:20:57.720 --> 04:21:03.790 align:start position:0%
they think we should address as a full
committee

04:21:03.790 --> 04:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
astonishing okay I'm glad that we've all
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
studied House Bill 2 so thoroughly
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we're happy with it
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.880 --> 04:21:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
biceps

04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.929 --> 04:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
um mental health I think the mental
 
04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
health is all right
 
04:21:36.769 --> 04:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to reassure the Landscape
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
Architects Foresters Wetland scientists
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
soil scientists landscape architecture
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the Landscape Architects that we
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
understand you need your license we will
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
make sure that you have the opportunity
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
to keep them and if you have any major
 
04:21:55.929 --> 04:21:55.939 align:start position:0%
objections about a
 
04:21:57.889 --> 04:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
emerged board
 
04:21:59.929 --> 04:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
anyone have such major objections
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
all right sorry
 
04:22:09.170 --> 04:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
oh the
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
for the Foresters Landscape Architects
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
natural scientists Wetland scientists
 
04:22:15.840 --> 04:22:16.910 align:start position:0%
natural scientists Wetland scientists
and

04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:16.920 --> 04:22:19.130 align:start position:0%
and
person

04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
two names no no that
 
04:22:22.319 --> 04:22:23.689 align:start position:0%

everything
is

04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
awesome okay yes that we understand you
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
need your license we are going to make
 
04:22:34.849 --> 04:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
sure you it is not removed and if anyone
 
04:22:38.210 --> 04:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
has any serious objections to being in a
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
combined board rather than an individual
 
04:22:43.370 --> 04:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
board speak up an hour for hold your
 
04:22:43.380 --> 04:22:44.689 align:start position:0%
board speak up an hour for hold your
peace

04:22:44.689 --> 04:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
peace
 
04:22:57.490 --> 04:22:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
yes for the record I'm Jason stock I'm
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
04:23:04.210 --> 04:23:04.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
and uh given the the Mandate speak now
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
or forever hold your peace I figured I'd
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
better speak now
 
04:23:11.580 --> 04:23:12.410 align:start position:0%
better speak now
um

04:23:12.410 --> 04:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
and I we certainly we represent
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
landowners we'd also represent loggers
 
04:23:21.170 --> 04:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
Forest Products Foresters and some and
 
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
and lands we do have some landscapers
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
that are also members of our association
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
and I guess I I'll be brief because
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
you've had a long day but when when the
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
when the chair mentioned two options
 
04:23:38.809 --> 04:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
relative to this technical board one was
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
just delete the sections or then do kind
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
of a combined obviously we would prefer
 
04:23:48.170 --> 04:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
section one where you maintain the
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
boards excuse me maintain the maintain
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the boards and and why we would
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
argue that there is a value in doing
 
04:24:00.969 --> 04:24:00.979 align:start position:0%
that is to create a single Uber board
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
with all these disciplines on it
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
number one make in ensuring that you
 
04:24:09.050 --> 04:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
would have enough representation from
 
04:24:11.450 --> 04:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
all these areas of expertise you're
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to have a very large board
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
moreover you're going to have a board
 
04:24:18.050 --> 04:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to have individuals whose
 
04:24:19.490 --> 04:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
interests are
 
04:24:22.849 --> 04:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
not I would say their their expertise
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
isn't in the particular area if it's an
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
adjudicative matter and I would I would
 
04:24:29.809 --> 04:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
argue for land surveying if you're
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
sitting on a board and you're discussing
 
04:24:35.929 --> 04:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
a deed research issue adjudicative issue
 
04:24:38.330 --> 04:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
regarding deed research and you're an
 
04:24:40.130 --> 04:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
electrical engineer sitting on that
 
04:24:40.140 --> 04:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
electrical engineer sitting on that
board

04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:24:43.370 --> 04:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
you know that's not your area of
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
expertise yet you are being asked as a
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
professional to issue a professional
 
04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
opinion on someone else's work and so I
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
guess that for us that's that's a
 
04:24:57.889 --> 04:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
concern and we would raise it
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's one example again I would
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
you know if this is your decision
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
obviously to make this recommendation we
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
will also have these this discussion
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
with division one as well but I just
 
04:25:13.250 --> 04:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to again forever
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
you know speak now or forever to hold my
 
04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
peace I wanted to at least raise this
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
issue raise this raise some opposition
 
04:25:21.290 --> 04:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
and some concerns that we have with
 
04:25:24.110 --> 04:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
creating this larger board with such
 
04:25:26.150 --> 04:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
although they are similar and they do
 
04:25:27.769 --> 04:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
play well
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
um or well behaved I guess was the term
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are adjudicative matters there are
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
also establishing you know things that
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
are in terms of establishing the
 
04:25:39.170 --> 04:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
standards for the license that might be
 
04:25:42.110 --> 04:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
more specific to a particular particular
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
occupation or profession and again
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
asking someone from another profession
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
that isn't that related I think is
 
04:25:51.649 --> 04:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
asking a lot and with that I'll I'll
 
04:25:55.610 --> 04:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
conclude my my I guess testimony I would
 
04:25:57.250 --> 04:25:57.260 align:start position:0%
say that if these were not
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
well-established boards that already
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
have the criteria for licensure and so
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
forth already in their rules I would be
 
04:26:08.570 --> 04:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
much more hesitant to combine them but
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
these boards have been in existence for
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
quite a while the engineers board is
 
04:26:16.969 --> 04:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
over 100 years old I think the surveyors
 
04:26:16.979 --> 04:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
over 100 years old I think the surveyors
and

04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
Foresters are you know 20 40 years old
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
and the most recent one is the Landscape
 
04:26:27.060 --> 04:26:28.729 align:start position:0%
and the most recent one is the Landscape
Architects

04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
Architects
 
04:26:28.739 --> 04:26:29.809 align:start position:0%
Architects
um

04:26:29.809 --> 04:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
but they have developed these criteria
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
already all the rules of the current
 
04:26:39.889 --> 04:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
boards are going to be maintained
 
04:26:39.899 --> 04:26:41.450 align:start position:0%
boards are going to be maintained
they're

04:26:41.450 --> 04:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh so that that that will help a little
 
04:26:46.490 --> 04:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
bit with some of your concerns but
 
04:26:50.210 --> 04:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
you're right I I should think about that
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.570 --> 04:26:58.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair may I ask a question to this
 
04:27:01.370 --> 04:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
topic of the Forestry
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
so my question is in the forest is board
 
04:27:07.130 --> 04:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
do you know if they have problems with
 
04:27:10.610 --> 04:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
filling all the seats on the board
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
I heard that there's a has to be an
 
04:27:15.969 --> 04:27:15.979 align:start position:0%
uninterested Community member or uh
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
unbiased uh yeah a public member and
 
04:27:22.130 --> 04:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
that that position has been hard to to
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
film do you know if there's been one of
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
the concerns I think is that when we
 
04:27:28.729 --> 04:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
have a lot of openings on boards if we
 
04:27:30.530 --> 04:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
combine them it'll help fill all the
 
04:27:32.090 --> 04:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
seats so that's the nature of my
 
04:27:32.100 --> 04:27:33.050 align:start position:0%
seats so that's the nature of my
question

04:27:33.050 --> 04:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:33.060 --> 04:27:38.990 align:start position:0%
question
foreign

04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:44.809 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:27:44.809 --> 04:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.819 --> 04:27:45.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:45.659 --> 04:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:27:50.570 --> 04:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
I have heard that there is one seat they
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
have had some difficulty filling and
 
04:27:54.769 --> 04:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
this is trying to find someone that is
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
kind of completely
 
04:27:58.969 --> 04:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
divorce or devoid of anything remember
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
public member that has no
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
connection or interaction forest or
 
04:28:07.969 --> 04:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
forestry yeah pretty high I mean they're
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
even tree Harvest you know spouses of
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
tree Harvesters on legislative
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
requirement is somebody who's not
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
financially involved you still have to
 
04:28:29.149 --> 04:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
get somebody who cares about the topic
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
in in what one of the challenges is that
 
04:28:35.210 --> 04:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
being a forested state I mean there are
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are individuals landowners that
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
own Timberland that in any other
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
circumstance would be considered a
 
04:28:43.610 --> 04:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
public member but because they own
 
04:28:46.490 --> 04:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
Timberland and do a Timber sale every 10
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
to 20 years they now have a financial
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
interest in forestry and Timber
 
04:28:54.110 --> 04:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
harvesting and so that kind of knocks
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
them out of the box but anyway thank you
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up question I forgot I'm sorry
 
04:29:05.450 --> 04:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
okay here if you're all set okay good
 
04:29:09.469 --> 04:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:09.479 --> 04:29:10.969 align:start position:0%
 
any

04:29:10.969 --> 04:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir good afternoon Madam chair and
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
representatives my name is Ken Clinton
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
with Meridian Land Services we're a
 
04:29:19.490 --> 04:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
small civil consultant company in
 
04:29:22.610 --> 04:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
Amherst servicing uh providing projects
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
for civil engineering land surveying
 
04:29:27.170 --> 04:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientists survived
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
soil scientists and permanent deceptic
 
04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
designers so we're well versed in in
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
these areas I had written some testimony
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
and shared it by email to the to the
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
committee and in large part it was
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
against the elimination of Natural
 
04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
Sciences so thank you very much for
 
04:29:45.290 --> 04:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
moving that aside and hearing the
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
description of a larger joint board if
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
you will I've somewhat had to Pivot my
 
04:29:52.490 --> 04:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
position and say thank you for retaining
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientists and soil
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
scientists and I would be grudgingly
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
accept a more joint board approach
 
04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
however the language that's in current
 
04:30:03.530 --> 04:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 relative to the combined
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
Boards of Engineers and surveyors is in
 
04:30:09.290 --> 04:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
a word faulty it's incorrect it's
 
04:30:11.870 --> 04:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
incomplete it's poorly written and and
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe it reflects the
 
04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
actual regulations that are required for
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
either land surveyors or Engineers so if
 
04:30:19.849 --> 04:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
this was to occur occur the quote
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
unquote joint board approach I would
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
hope there's adequate time to make sure
 
04:30:25.969 --> 04:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
the language is correct
 
04:30:29.929 --> 04:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.769 --> 04:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
please uh amend and please amend it and
 
04:30:36.050 --> 04:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
correct it and I would love to have some
 
04:30:38.330 --> 04:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
more help
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I mean that's
 
04:30:43.849 --> 04:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
I've been been struggling with it I
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want to change any of the
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure certification
 
04:30:52.490 --> 04:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
but I did was trying to combine what the
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
board responsibilities were and Madam
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
chair I wasn't referring to any
 
04:30:57.290 --> 04:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment it was the original bill as
 
04:30:59.210 --> 04:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
introduced oh well this is cut and paste
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
trust me I didn't uh I didn't intend to
 
04:31:06.969 --> 04:31:06.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
so I remember my other question and and
 
04:31:11.689 --> 04:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh if the Timberland guy has to come
 
04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
back that'll be fine and I really
 
04:31:14.929 --> 04:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
actually like the way the two of you
 
04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
joined in the sea greeted each other
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
started to show a little bit of maybe
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very small state they've probably
 
04:31:23.090 --> 04:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
been working together that could be an
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
indication of how a joint board would
 
04:31:26.570 --> 04:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
work exactly
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so my question to both of you is
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
could the could there be like
 
04:31:33.290 --> 04:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittees I maybe Madam chair needs
 
04:31:35.450 --> 04:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on this within the board to
 
04:31:37.370 --> 04:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
handle the kind of disciplinary actions
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
that could come up so that you could
 
04:31:41.210 --> 04:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
keep the professional expertise of each
 
04:31:42.889 --> 04:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
of the areas but it could be under one
 
04:31:46.010 --> 04:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
board without needing as many members to
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.330 --> 04:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
if if such a joint board has to occur
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
then I would support some level of
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that would be specialized
 
04:32:01.330 --> 04:32:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
I would think especially in the case of
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
adjudicative matters where you're really
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
getting into the Weeds on someone's
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
professional performance you know
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
relative to a land use issue survey
 
04:32:16.010 --> 04:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever if if yeah and to be honest
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's what the
 
04:32:21.769 --> 04:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
the board is the their knowledge is most
 
04:32:24.530 --> 04:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
important for I mean there are probably
 
04:32:27.649 --> 04:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
marginal licensure cases well you know
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
is this person's experience quite good
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
enough or is there their criminal record
 
04:32:34.969 --> 04:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
bad enough but
 
04:32:37.790 --> 04:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
but those are few and far between it's
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
in the cases of a poor practice that you
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
really need the expertise
 
04:32:46.729 --> 04:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
all right I mean anyone else
 
04:32:46.739 --> 04:32:49.309 align:start position:0%
all right I mean anyone else
uh

04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:51.649 --> 04:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh there's four ladies there one of you
 
04:32:53.929 --> 04:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
come up and the rest oh Lindsay how nice
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.880 --> 04:33:00.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:00.649 --> 04:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.970 --> 04:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess thank you representative
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
McGuire members of the committee for the
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
record Lindsay Courtney executive
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
director office of professional life
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
insurance certification
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of discussion and
 
04:33:17.330 --> 04:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
it appears to be a lot of confusion as
 
04:33:19.369 --> 04:33:19.379 align:start position:0%
to what's contained in hb2 and I don't
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
know whether it would be helpful for
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
anybody or for for there to be an
 
04:33:26.209 --> 04:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
overview which I'm happy to provide of
 
04:33:28.670 --> 04:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal prior to
 
04:33:30.410 --> 04:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
considering the bits and pieces of House
 
04:33:32.631 --> 04:33:32.641 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 so I just wanted to offer that
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't sure whether there was
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
going to be an opportunity for hearing
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
either here I know the Bill's not here
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
or before Finance
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
I I suspect that finances Fox finance
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
will be having a public hearing I'm not
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
sure that they're going to be digging as
 
04:33:52.131 --> 04:33:52.141 align:start position:0%
deep into this section as as we are
 
04:33:53.689 --> 04:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
in fact I'm pretty sure they're not
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:33:55.020 --> 04:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
going to
so

04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.250 --> 04:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
so on that is there is there going to be
 
04:34:04.010 --> 04:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
an overview of the bill itself prior to
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
looking at it in bits and pieces or I
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
guess my question is whether there's
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a hearing I'm a little
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
confused by the process and I don't no
 
04:34:15.410 --> 04:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
disrespect Madam chair I'm just trying
 
04:34:16.490 --> 04:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
04:34:20.631 --> 04:34:20.641 align:start position:0%
the process is that house bill 2 is the
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of Finance they will have
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
a public hearing however they have
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
as is commonly done they've asked
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
various other committees to look at
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
other sections of the Bill of Hospital 2
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
for their expertise
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
Edna got dumped with with this section
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
as which is the biggest single section
 
04:34:46.141 --> 04:34:48.289 align:start position:0%
as which is the biggest single section
so

04:34:48.289 --> 04:34:48.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
um we try
 
04:34:52.849 --> 04:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
we've since in the weeks since we've
 
04:34:55.970 --> 04:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
gotten the actual bill we've I've been
 
04:34:58.730 --> 04:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
looking at it and come up with with this
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
the only hard committee recommendation
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
is that we eliminate the structural
 
04:35:09.170 --> 04:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
reorganization because we've got that in
 
04:35:12.051 --> 04:35:12.061 align:start position:0%
houses 655. we want that out of house
 
04:35:14.769 --> 04:35:14.779 align:start position:0%
bill too certainly the rest of it we're
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
discussing what do we want to recommend
 
04:35:20.929 --> 04:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
to our our friends in finance the so
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
take out the the board of mental health
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
practice as a suggestion that say that
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
we think it needs more work
 
04:35:28.561 --> 04:35:30.410 align:start position:0%
we think it needs more work
um

04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:32.449 --> 04:35:32.459 align:start position:0%
and other people are looking at other
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
sections so
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
um we don't really want to take
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
ownership of the governor's plan
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
at least I don't
 
04:35:46.970 --> 04:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
so no that's helpful because we are
 
04:35:48.410 --> 04:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
Fielding a lot of inquiries particularly
 
04:35:50.929 --> 04:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
from our boards and I think there's just
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
including myself has been a lot of
 
04:35:55.131 --> 04:35:55.141 align:start position:0%
confusion as to this process what I
 
04:35:57.289 --> 04:35:57.299 align:start position:0%
would say is I'm happy to work with
 
04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
anybody who's who's establishing a
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we have done a significant
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
amount of legislative research and just
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
general research and are able to provide
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
some some information if that may be
 
04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
helpful so thank you representative for
 
04:36:13.250 --> 04:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that for me and I think
 
04:36:15.289 --> 04:36:15.299 align:start position:0%
for a lot of other people
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that's been helpful okay
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
um verbs and gold thank you and I know I
 
04:36:23.390 --> 04:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
will definitely want to be connecting
 
04:36:25.369 --> 04:36:25.379 align:start position:0%
with you to go over what you have for
 
04:36:27.051 --> 04:36:27.061 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health Board yeah thank you
 
04:36:29.090 --> 04:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
happy to do that yeah well the the other
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of us taking it out of house
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill too is that we can we have another
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
six months to work on it which
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure some of this was more
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
hurried than all of us would have liked
 
04:36:41.459 --> 04:36:43.631 align:start position:0%
hurried than all of us would have liked
okay

04:36:43.631 --> 04:36:43.641 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:46.490 --> 04:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
one of that those ladies standing up yes
 
04:36:50.090 --> 04:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you madam chair
 
04:36:56.209 --> 04:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
my name is Elizabeth Eaton and I am an
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
attorney with the office of professional
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification uh and I am
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
board counsel so I'm here on behalf of
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
several boards and I heard you say you
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear from boards that are
 
04:37:10.369 --> 04:37:10.379 align:start position:0%
concerned about merging and so I have Dr
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Sartori here who is the chair
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the board of Podiatry
 
04:37:17.529 --> 04:37:17.539 align:start position:0%
um and so we wanted to speak about why
 
04:37:20.029 --> 04:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh merging the Board of Medicine with
 
04:37:22.010 --> 04:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
the board of Podiatry could be
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the profession did you
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
want a speaker
 
04:37:29.929 --> 04:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
hi thank you very much for your time
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I've been on the board of Podiatry
 
04:37:33.529 --> 04:37:33.539 align:start position:0%
for the past 10 years I've been the
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
chair for the past five years and I I
 
04:37:37.320 --> 04:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
chair for the past five years and I I
understand

04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:37:43.010 --> 04:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
um why this bill was proposed and it
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
seems like a logical way to streamline
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
operations and save costs but I think it
 
04:37:48.529 --> 04:37:48.539 align:start position:0%
will have a serious negative consequence
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
for the practice of podiatry in our
 
04:37:50.219 --> 04:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
for the practice of podiatry in our
state

04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
Podiatry is a specialized field of
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
medicine and it requires a unique set of
 
04:37:58.010 --> 04:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
skills and expertise we undergo a lot of
 
04:38:00.170 --> 04:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
training it's extensive we are the
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
experts in the foot and the ankle and by
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
merging the two boards the board of
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
Podiatry and the Board of Medicine
 
04:38:08.090 --> 04:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
together we risk diluting that expertise
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the podiatrist reducing their ability
 
04:38:13.730 --> 04:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
to provide Specialized Care further
 
04:38:13.740 --> 04:38:15.769 align:start position:0%
to provide Specialized Care further
um

04:38:15.769 --> 04:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
if we merge the two boards it's probably
 
04:38:19.970 --> 04:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
going to result in a loss of focus on
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
the specific needs of the issues facing
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
the Podiatry Community podiatrists have
 
04:38:27.529 --> 04:38:27.539 align:start position:0%
unique challenges and concerns that are
 
04:38:28.609 --> 04:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
distinct from those of other medical
 
04:38:30.769 --> 04:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
professionals and we need a dedicated
 
04:38:33.170 --> 04:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
board that can address these issues this
 
04:38:36.170 --> 04:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
board has been present for over 50 years
 
04:38:36.180 --> 04:38:36.769 align:start position:0%
board has been present for over 50 years
um

04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that if we merge the two
 
04:38:41.209 --> 04:38:41.219 align:start position:0%
boards it's gonna it's just there's
 
04:38:42.830 --> 04:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be a lack of accountability we
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
need a clear and access accessible
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
process for licensure and Regulation and
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
discipline and I think that will become
 
04:38:51.410 --> 04:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
more difficult for podiatrists to
 
04:38:54.170 --> 04:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
navigate through if it is merged with
 
04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and I urge you
 
04:39:00.289 --> 04:39:00.299 align:start position:0%
guys to please reconsider that proposal
 
04:39:02.209 --> 04:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
and really look at that section if you
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.369 --> 04:39:10.379 align:start position:0%
are there any other medical practices
 
04:39:12.650 --> 04:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
that are not part of the Board of
 
04:39:15.490 --> 04:39:15.500 align:start position:0%
Medicine other than Podiatry
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
optometrists chiropractors
 
04:39:18.000 --> 04:39:19.730 align:start position:0%
optometrists chiropractors
uh

04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
two of which I can think of right now I
 
04:39:21.359 --> 04:39:22.670 align:start position:0%
two of which I can think of right now I
mean

04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
but things like neurosurgeons that would
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
be Board of Medicine yes Board of
 
04:39:27.000 --> 04:39:28.209 align:start position:0%
be Board of Medicine yes Board of
Medicine

04:39:28.209 --> 04:39:28.219 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
thoracic surgery Board of Medicine
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
right and I think that those are fairly
 
04:39:32.879 --> 04:39:34.010 align:start position:0%
right and I think that those are fairly
unique

04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:39:37.131 --> 04:39:37.141 align:start position:0%
Specialties so I don't really it's not
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe you but and I know
 
04:39:41.630 --> 04:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
the feet are important because they
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
carry your whole body and I believe you
 
04:39:46.850 --> 04:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I believe that myself but I don't
 
04:39:48.830 --> 04:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
know how
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
a specialty such as yours would be
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
different from other Specialties that
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
are as important to the body so can you
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
explain that sure
 
04:40:01.320 --> 04:40:02.270 align:start position:0%
explain that sure
um

04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:04.970 --> 04:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
Podiatry has worked really hard to gain
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
its name and and its place in the
 
04:40:10.208 --> 04:40:10.218 align:start position:0%
community where it is right now
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are Specialties that and I don't
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
know how to say this nicely aren't
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
really Pro Podiatry merging us with the
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine puts us in with those
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
Specialties and it will make it very
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
difficult if there is only one
 
04:40:24.890 --> 04:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
podiatrist on that board
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to get anything passed that I
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
think will benefit podiatrists it will
 
04:40:33.170 --> 04:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
only hurt the community
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:40:35.840 --> 04:40:37.610 align:start position:0%
all right

Adam chair I think I can dig into this a
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna figure out how I can word this
 
04:40:44.760 --> 04:40:46.090 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna figure out how I can word this
properly

04:40:46.090 --> 04:40:46.100 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
are there areas of treatment
 
04:40:53.810 --> 04:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
where medicine and Podiatry might both
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
claim is their territory yes this is
 
04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
this is part of the uh part of the
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem and I see what the turf battle
 
04:41:07.010 --> 04:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
is I and I and I learned this in working
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
in other states so this isn't a New
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thing oh okay uh so I can see
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
your see your point that uh if I may
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
that you you might feel you might not
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
get a fair Shake is that correct okay
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you Matt
 
04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
all right uh Representative Patrick
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
since you have the honor of knowing
 
04:41:30.410 --> 04:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
about this would you uh take the lead in
 
04:41:30.420 --> 04:41:31.788 align:start position:0%
about this would you uh take the lead in
deciding

04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation if we should do
 
04:41:34.260 --> 04:41:37.010 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation if we should do
anything

04:41:37.010 --> 04:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.050 --> 04:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
well it would thank you madam chair it
 
04:41:41.330 --> 04:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
would it would appear that it's not as
 
04:41:44.590 --> 04:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
as straight cut as we had thought
 
04:41:46.850 --> 04:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would have it would appear from what
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
I see at this at this moment that we
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
might not that we might not not want to
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
merge a podiatry in with uh with uh
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
medicine and also it should be also
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
stated at this point that I do
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
I do believe that
 
04:42:05.760 --> 04:42:07.550 align:start position:0%
I do believe that
the

04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
the entire theory of Kai
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
Cairo Chiropractic is that it isn't
 
04:42:15.840 --> 04:42:21.850 align:start position:0%
Cairo Chiropractic is that it isn't
medicine

04:42:21.850 --> 04:42:21.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
is not exactly medicine right so I I
 
04:42:27.170 --> 04:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're looking for me if
 
04:42:30.250 --> 04:42:30.260 align:start position:0%
you want a recommendation or emotion I
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
um well I know I just see the I see I
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
see the point that's all okay the need
 
04:42:41.930 --> 04:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
if if you will thank you
 
04:42:44.448 --> 04:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
the board of Podiatry did bring some
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony from all three members
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to consider that I well I
 
04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
at the trouble is that we keep running
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
is there an enthusiasm in the committee
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
for pulling out the word of medicine no
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
I see a couple of head shakes
 
04:43:05.878 --> 04:43:08.690 align:start position:0%
I see a couple of head shakes
uh

04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say something that might be
 
04:43:11.040 --> 04:43:13.850 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say something that might be
helpful

04:43:13.850 --> 04:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
and it's not that I want to just come
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're going to run into Turf
 
04:43:21.240 --> 04:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're going to run into Turf
battles

04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
battles
 
04:43:23.040 --> 04:43:25.310 align:start position:0%
battles
and

04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
it said that we're not sympathetic to
 
04:43:27.360 --> 04:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
it said that we're not sympathetic to
them

04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
but that can't be
 
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
the only reason
 
04:43:34.200 --> 04:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
the only reason
that

04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
and you can respond but that can't be
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
the only reason that
 
04:43:44.330 --> 04:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
you can't have
 
04:43:46.850 --> 04:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
and maybe you're saying one person on
 
04:43:49.610 --> 04:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
the board isn't enough maybe that could
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
be your vehicle to getting more voice
 
04:43:55.490 --> 04:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that
 
04:43:58.730 --> 04:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
we can't just say okay we're not because
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
this is not our bill right this is the
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
governor's bill this is the governor's
 
04:44:03.180 --> 04:44:04.250 align:start position:0%
governor's bill this is the governor's
language

04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we can't just say well we don't like
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
any of this and we're just going to take
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
everything out so we're sort of in a
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
diff you know we are trying to come up
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
with a way based on our experience
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
and base and and there are
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives on this board who have
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
been on this board for a long time
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to come up with some
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
things that we see as pitfalls
 
04:44:29.280 --> 04:44:31.610 align:start position:0%
things that we see as pitfalls
and

04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
a Turf battle is not a pitfall that's
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
why we're sort of you know all stepping
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
back from that
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
does that make sense and you can please
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
help me with that sure
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I will make one other point first and
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:44:47.760 --> 04:44:48.948 align:start position:0%
that is
um

04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's not just a Turf battle these affect
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
hospital privileges they affect surgical
 
04:44:54.600 --> 04:44:55.970 align:start position:0%
hospital privileges they affect surgical
privileges

04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
privileges
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
I've gone to battle at one of the
 
04:45:00.288 --> 04:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
hospitals over this
 
04:45:02.330 --> 04:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
and podiatrists were at risk of losing
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
certain surgical privileges so it's not
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
just a Turf battle it is real
 
04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
and putting one podiatrist on that board
 
04:45:10.730 --> 04:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
is a mistake
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing I will discuss is the
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine already meets once a
 
04:45:17.930 --> 04:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
month they meet for about 10 hours
 
04:45:21.530 --> 04:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
usually we had 47 hearings that we had
 
04:45:23.570 --> 04:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
to take care of in the board of Podiatry
 
04:45:25.490 --> 04:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
that adds a tremendous burden to the
 
04:45:30.170 --> 04:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and the people on that
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
board and from what I understand the the
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
bill recommends dropping the number of
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
people down in on that particular board
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
to five I think seven total
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
but one is a podiatrist one's a public
 
04:45:48.050 --> 04:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
member and then the five
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine Representatives so I
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
feel like it increases the burden on
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
that board more than what I think is
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
thought excuse me how many cases did you
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
say you've heard 47.
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
that was regarding license renewal
 
04:46:08.810 --> 04:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
well that's I'm I'm shocked to hear you
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
say that because there are
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
according to the oplc report 91
 
04:46:16.610 --> 04:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
podiatrists in the state that's correct
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
and you had 47 cases 47 based on renewal
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
of license yeah I don't know if those
 
04:46:24.288 --> 04:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
are disciplinary or just they're
 
04:46:25.850 --> 04:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
handling the renewals this is just a
 
04:46:28.490 --> 04:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
renewal just the renewals oh that oplc
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
is going to do that yeah that's those
 
04:46:34.010 --> 04:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
are hearings hearings on renewals issues
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
that came up during the renewal process
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
that they needed to have a hearing for
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
it sounds like okay well that sounds
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
like you've got problems other than uh
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
respect from the Board of Medicine okay
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative Earhart
 
04:46:48.128 --> 04:46:48.138 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:46:51.650 --> 04:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
can you give an example of one of the
 
04:46:54.650 --> 04:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
serious situations that you need the
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
hospital privileges is that the most
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
serious situation that you've
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
encountered that you need to deal with I
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
mean yes I think um
 
04:47:04.610 --> 04:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
as far as being on the board goes
 
04:47:07.610 --> 04:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we've encountered podiatrists we've
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
suspended licenses before
 
04:47:13.310 --> 04:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
um for certain things such as uh
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
working at a scope of practice working
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
without infection control
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
I mean it's okay so follow up
 
04:47:23.448 --> 04:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Medicine would not be
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
able to handle these I think they could
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think it just puts more burden on them
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
for that particular issue
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to negligence if
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
someone is there's a complaint on
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
negligence I'm not sure people fully
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
understand the scope of Podiatry and
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.090 --> 04:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
04:47:44.100 --> 04:47:47.150 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
representative

04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%

a Friday afternoon to show up and
 
04:48:05.448 --> 04:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
express your concerns
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the the fact that we've received so
 
04:48:09.288 --> 04:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
many emails from so many different
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
Industries is great and
 
04:48:15.170 --> 04:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that you guys are
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
asking for more representation so it's
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
not just one on on a board that it's a
 
04:48:23.448 --> 04:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
combined effort so we'll keep that in
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
mind as we push this forward as the
 
04:48:28.128 --> 04:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative from Rye suggested that
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is not our bill and that will push
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
our recommendations forward there'll be
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I can assure you that
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
the people on this committee are working
 
04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
super hard at this these people have
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
been going through this so with your
 
04:48:41.330 --> 04:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
concerns are warranted thank you for
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
showing up and I do want to also put you
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
rest assured also that nothing happens
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
in in my short time here nothing happens
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
quickly it's going to go through our
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee it's going to go to finance in
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
between it goes to Black and go to our
 
04:48:59.330 --> 04:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
committee it's not going to our
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
committee no we're we're going
 
04:49:04.490 --> 04:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
I mean ours are we're working on it we
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
push our suggestions to finance then it
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
has to go to house I believe
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so it goes back and forth a lot so I
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted I know people are concerned
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to happen overnight and
 
04:49:17.448 --> 04:49:17.458 align:start position:0%

somebody from the governor's office
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%

04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon

I'm Dee Juris from the governor's office
 
04:50:07.010 --> 04:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
yes you were going we're asking you to
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
do you know the reason for uh these
 
04:50:11.280 --> 04:50:13.550 align:start position:0%
do you know the reason for uh these
consolidations

04:50:13.550 --> 04:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
consolidations
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes um I'd love to give a kind of an
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
overview kind of the thought process
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
behind the governor's proposal
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
um if you'll indulge me for a few
 
04:50:20.940 --> 04:50:21.890 align:start position:0%
um if you'll indulge me for a few
minutes

04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we'd love to do that for you so as
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
you all know you've heard the governor
 
04:50:27.770 --> 04:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
speak he is all about cutting red tape
 
04:50:30.650 --> 04:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
regulation he wants to reduce barriers
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
to Workforce
 
04:50:34.850 --> 04:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's no it's no surprise I've
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
heard in other committees even today we
 
04:50:38.690 --> 04:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
have a Workforce shortage we're having
 
04:50:40.368 --> 04:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
trouble finding people to fill positions
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
and we also want to make sure that the
 
04:50:44.570 --> 04:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
state isn't interfering in people's
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
ability to work to enter in these
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
professions and we want to make sure
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
that the barriers are high enough to
 
04:50:54.650 --> 04:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
protect Public Safety but not so high as
 
04:50:54.660 --> 04:50:55.850 align:start position:0%
protect Public Safety but not so high as
to

04:50:55.850 --> 04:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
insert the state into over-regulating
 
04:51:00.050 --> 04:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult to enter these
 
04:51:00.060 --> 04:51:01.250 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult to enter these
professions

04:51:01.250 --> 04:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
professions
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
so in our office in our in our proposal
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
we took a broad
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
a really comprehensive look
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
across all of the licensing boards
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
through the state we looked at things
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
like number of licensees per board
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
number of complaints received
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
number of actions taken and
 
04:51:23.930 --> 04:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
and took a look to say
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
do they well I mean the biggest one is
 
04:51:27.410 --> 04:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
do they need to be licensed at all does
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
this license need to exist another one
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
is do we need a full a full board to be
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
reviewing all of these things I think
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
this committee has made recommendations
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
I believe last session in Senate Bill
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
330 as to making some adjustments to the
 
04:51:41.570 --> 04:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility of these licensing
 
04:51:43.368 --> 04:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
committees so we're taking into
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
consideration some of those additionally
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
can some of these professional boards be
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
advisory so that we have the technical
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
expertise needed but we allow efficiency
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
some licensees can wait 30 60 90 days to
 
04:51:57.170 --> 04:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
be issued a license after they've
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
applied and we don't we don't want the
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
state to be in the way of people
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
entering the workforce in that regard
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a big 30 000 foot I do have
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
more specific details that I would be
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
happy to share with you or I can defer
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
to director Courtney who has worked
 
04:52:16.250 --> 04:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
tirelessly for all of you right she's
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking into reviewing this legislation
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
she and her team um have done a deep
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
Vive and have have done a deep dive and
 
04:52:23.810 --> 04:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
also have some legislative history as
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
well that we'd be happy to share some
 
04:52:28.610 --> 04:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
context with you
 
04:52:32.270 --> 04:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
so all of this has Merit putting it in
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill of the budget is like
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
putting the entire population of the con
 
04:52:45.288 --> 04:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
the country on the Titanic and that is
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
what is wrong this discussion is very
 
04:52:50.810 --> 04:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
valuable the involvement of this
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee is very valuable and useful
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
but putting it in the trailer bill of
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
ain't the way to do it that's a problem
 
04:53:00.530 --> 04:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:00.540 --> 04:53:04.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
so we looked we have some similar
 
04:53:09.650 --> 04:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
concerns in this committee because we
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
are where
 
04:53:16.128 --> 04:53:16.138 align:start position:0%
the oplc lives in legislation
 
04:53:18.650 --> 04:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
and I can say that
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
we've worked hard with the oplc to
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand the issues that they have
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
we balance efficiency and Public Safety
 
04:53:30.480 --> 04:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
we balance efficiency and Public Safety
equally

04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.490 --> 04:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.500 --> 04:53:43.310 align:start position:0%
 
responsibility

04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:53:46.190 --> 04:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
as Representatives on this committee
 
04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
04:53:52.490 --> 04:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
that our processes are effective yet
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
they don't minimize
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
Public Safety or cause issues within the
 
04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
office and the boards
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
04:54:07.970 --> 04:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
and we support
 
04:54:11.208 --> 04:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
the mission of
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
however we may be looking at it
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
differently because we live here
 
04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
we live with them
 
04:54:20.280 --> 04:54:22.190 align:start position:0%
we live with them
so

04:54:22.190 --> 04:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:25.128 --> 04:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
um I think that we've addressed the
 
04:54:27.530 --> 04:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
licensing bottleneck by giving the
 
04:54:29.690 --> 04:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oplc
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
we agree with that I think that what
 
04:54:35.448 --> 04:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
we're hashing out are things that are
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
significantly different than that
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're not administrative they are
 
04:54:42.770 --> 04:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
related to they are related to the
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
boards and to the relationship and we're
 
04:54:47.770 --> 04:54:47.780 align:start position:0%
not saying that though that Pro that
 
04:54:52.250 --> 04:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
process is without fault
 
04:54:55.550 --> 04:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
because we're well aware of that
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
what we're specifically asking and
 
04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps you may need to get back to us
 
04:55:06.050 --> 04:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
on that is why the governor wants to put
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
the board of Podiatry into the Board of
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
Medicine why he wants to merge those two
 
04:55:11.390 --> 04:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
because that's the discussion that we're
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
having right now
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to address that briefly
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
and then I would love to turn over to
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
director Courtney to address the
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
specifics of that because she also lives
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the boards every day
 
04:55:25.200 --> 04:55:26.270 align:start position:0%
with the boards every day
um

04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
so why the board of Podiatry so I'm
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to kick it over to her
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
um just generally speaking
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
that when you look at what is happening
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
in 655 in terms of allowing the office
 
04:55:43.490 --> 04:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
to issue licenses allowing the office to
 
04:55:45.770 --> 04:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
provide over hearings while allowing and
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
requiring that the boards make findings
 
04:55:50.810 --> 04:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
of fact that
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the question becomes whether every
 
04:55:56.288 --> 04:55:56.298 align:start position:0%
profession truly needs their own board
 
04:55:59.570 --> 04:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
and if the rules and responsibilities
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
are being changed as is were proposed by
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
this Committee in 655 I would submit we
 
04:56:10.010 --> 04:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
probably don't need a board for each
 
04:56:13.250 --> 04:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
profession and so what the governor had
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
proposed like you had mentioned
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire with similarly
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
situated or similar professions that in
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
light of the changes proposed both in
 
04:56:28.128 --> 04:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
this Budget Trailer and in 655 that we
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
combine those particular professions to
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
have one board
 
04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
essentially to reduce you know
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight there's there
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
will no longer be a need to have for
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
example 27 different types of mental
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
health professionals appointed because
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
they will not be under the proposal
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
reviewing applications at every monthly
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
meeting for example so that is the gist
 
04:56:56.810 --> 04:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
of The Proposal it wasn't just the board
 
04:56:58.250 --> 04:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
of Podiatry and the Board of Medicine
 
04:57:01.490 --> 04:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
that was proposed to be merged obviously
 
04:57:01.500 --> 04:57:02.448 align:start position:0%
that was proposed to be merged obviously
um

04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:04.970 --> 04:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
so essentially the governor's proposal
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay a question just to follow up to my
 
04:57:14.930 --> 04:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
previous one
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
do do the podiatrist and the medical
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
doctors dispute
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
which areas is their jurors is their
 
04:57:30.410 --> 04:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on the leg lower on the
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
lower leg because I know they usually
 
04:57:33.410 --> 04:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
fight over the ankle area but I'm not
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
so I think you heard probably earlier
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
um that they there is a dispute over
 
04:57:41.458 --> 04:57:42.890 align:start position:0%
um that they there is a dispute over
that

04:57:42.890 --> 04:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
um what I would say is if they have
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that is overlapping the the
 
04:57:48.000 --> 04:57:49.490 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that is overlapping the the
argument

04:57:49.490 --> 04:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
argument
 
04:57:51.890 --> 04:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
um in response to that would be it would
 
04:57:54.110 --> 04:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
make sense then to combine them under
 
04:57:55.970 --> 04:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
the same board given that the
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and the subject matters
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
overlap follow-up see yes I would think
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
that that would that would be the reason
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
why they shouldn't uh be on the same
 
04:58:10.610 --> 04:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
board but uh you know reach entitled to
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
interpreting the facts how we see them
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:58:15.660 --> 04:58:17.050 align:start position:0%
any other
okay

04:58:17.050 --> 04:58:17.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine no it's almost
 
04:58:20.400 --> 04:58:23.448 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine no it's almost
cities

04:58:23.448 --> 04:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
well actually in there are a large
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
number of cases where the scope of
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
practice overlaps
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
and what we normally try to do is to say
 
04:58:35.340 --> 04:58:36.350 align:start position:0%
and what we normally try to do is to say
that

04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:38.690 --> 04:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
if it's in your scope of practice you
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
can do it even if it's also in someone
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
else's scope of practice and we strongly
 
04:58:47.570 --> 04:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
oppose the idea that you have to get two
 
04:58:49.850 --> 04:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
different licenses in order to work on
 
04:58:51.770 --> 04:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
one piece of
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
of body say you know
 
04:58:58.490 --> 04:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one reason to it
 
04:58:58.500 --> 04:58:59.868 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one reason to it
to

04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
consider that that they should work
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
together because obviously they're not
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
going to do too many different things on
 
04:59:10.490 --> 04:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
the end I hope if I might clarify Madam
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
chair just briefly they're not opposing
 
04:59:14.330 --> 04:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
any changes to the licensure of
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
podiatrists just that their jurisdiction
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
would fall under the Board of Medicine
 
04:59:18.000 --> 04:59:19.430 align:start position:0%
would fall under the Board of Medicine
yeah

04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.440 --> 04:59:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
ah

04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:59:37.090 --> 04:59:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you we'll uh
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
we'll look we'll think about that
 
04:59:43.500 --> 04:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
we'll look we'll think about that
um

04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:46.850 --> 04:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I think we're we're losing a bit of
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
steam does anyone else have something
 
04:59:50.690 --> 04:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely urgent that they uh need to
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.448 --> 05:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Sherry Stevens and I am a midwife
 
05:00:20.458 --> 05:00:21.530 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Sherry Stevens and I am a midwife
we

05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um a New Hampshire certified midwife and
 
05:00:26.330 --> 05:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're very small board and I just wanted
 
05:00:30.650 --> 05:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
to go on record to say that hb2 takes
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
our board and makes us an Advisory Board
 
05:00:36.010 --> 05:00:36.020 align:start position:0%
and we think that would severely
 
05:00:39.070 --> 05:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
impede our profession as a profession
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
and so we are we have a lot of concerns
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
about that it would put all the power
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
into the executive director and I
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
although we
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I have Lindsay now we don't know in
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
the future who that executive director
 
05:00:54.410 --> 05:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
would be to make our legislation to make
 
05:00:55.730 --> 05:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
our discipline and to make our
 
05:00:57.288 --> 05:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
certification process
 
05:01:01.128 --> 05:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
and if we can't retain our ability to be
 
05:01:03.530 --> 05:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
our small little board and all these
 
05:01:05.208 --> 05:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
other boards are trying not to combine
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
but we would rather combined with a
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
board to be able to keep our power and
 
05:01:11.690 --> 05:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
not give it all over to the executive
 
05:01:11.700 --> 05:01:12.890 align:start position:0%
not give it all over to the executive
director

05:01:12.890 --> 05:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
director
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else yes ma'am and then
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
the person in the back all I can see is
 
05:01:27.128 --> 05:01:27.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.410 --> 05:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes hi thank you so much Madam chair my
 
05:01:32.750 --> 05:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
name is Dr Michelle half I'm here on
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Association
 
05:01:37.010 --> 05:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
of naturopathic doctors and I wanted to
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
piggy tell on on what the midwives
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
Association is saying we are also in
 
05:01:44.690 --> 05:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
that group where they're proposing to
 
05:01:46.910 --> 05:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
um transition us from a board of
 
05:01:49.368 --> 05:01:49.378 align:start position:0%
examiners to an advisory Council an
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and so um in addition to
 
05:01:55.250 --> 05:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
us really losing our power we think this
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
is a public safety issue where the
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
executive director would be making the
 
05:02:03.410 --> 05:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
final decision on proposed rules and
 
05:02:06.050 --> 05:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
repealing rules without any knowledge of
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
the practice of of medicine much less
 
05:02:11.690 --> 05:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medicine specific to us we
 
05:02:14.090 --> 05:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
are also prescribers in the state of New
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have a list we have a
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
formulary from which we prescribe
 
05:02:21.288 --> 05:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
medications and when that list needs
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
revising it goes to a formulary
 
05:02:23.040 --> 05:02:24.170 align:start position:0%
revising it goes to a formulary
committee

05:02:24.170 --> 05:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
and as it stands now that formulary
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
committee takes those recommendations
 
05:02:31.128 --> 05:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
and sends it back to our Board of
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
examiners that has four naturopathic
 
05:02:36.770 --> 05:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
doctors and a public public member on
 
05:02:38.208 --> 05:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
this Advisory Board would have just
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
three naturopathic doctors but you know
 
05:02:43.550 --> 05:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
they would not have the final decision
 
05:02:46.730 --> 05:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
on this they would just be advising
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
um on policy that would would affect
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
what medications can be prescribed to
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
the public we really feel like this is a
 
05:02:57.530 --> 05:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
safety issue removing our public a
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
member is another issue our public
 
05:03:01.490 --> 05:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
member is our current chair of our Board
 
05:03:04.970 --> 05:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
of examiners we think if oplc's entire
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
purpose is to protect the public then
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
having the public in the room is
 
05:03:08.218 --> 05:03:09.948 align:start position:0%
having the public in the room is
important

05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:03:09.958 --> 05:03:10.550 align:start position:0%
important
um

05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:14.090 --> 05:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
so we just we wanted to to bring those
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
concerns forward thank you so much for
 
05:03:20.330 --> 05:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.340 --> 05:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to be stopping at quarter
 
05:03:26.448 --> 05:03:26.458 align:start position:0%
after I want to mention that this person
 
05:03:26.458 --> 05:03:32.750 align:start position:0%
after I want to mention that this person
please

05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:35.208 --> 05:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm Amy Wilson the
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
vice president of New Hampshire
 
05:03:37.868 --> 05:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and Asian medicine
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
Association and I Echo echoed what the
 
05:03:43.610 --> 05:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
naturopaths and midwives have said we're
 
05:03:45.650 --> 05:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
also being selected to be part of the
 
05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
advisory and we are uncertain
 
05:03:51.288 --> 05:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
um exactly what that means but we're
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
also a very unique profession in the
 
05:03:56.090 --> 05:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
state in that we hold diagnostic license
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and being
 
05:04:03.050 --> 05:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
we continue to be treated separately and
 
05:04:05.330 --> 05:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
it was apparent during covid when we
 
05:04:08.270 --> 05:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
were left off the list of
 
05:04:10.970 --> 05:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
um essential workers and grouped with
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
the tattoo body art group and it's being
 
05:04:17.170 --> 05:04:17.180 align:start position:0%
happening again with this Advisory Board
 
05:04:20.930 --> 05:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
and noticing that last year when certain
 
05:04:23.690 --> 05:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
professions were put or trades put to an
 
05:04:25.850 --> 05:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board this year they're up for
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
repeal and that makes us very nervous
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so and also thinking about uh
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
listening to
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
um your sections at the beginning I just
 
05:04:39.070 --> 05:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as you're
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
retracting language
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
from hb2
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
the section for the acupuncturist is 289
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
to 301 and was on page 103 and you
 
05:04:52.970 --> 05:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
stopped at 285 so I want to make sure
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we're included in that language
 
05:04:57.050 --> 05:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
that you strike the language that we
 
05:04:59.628 --> 05:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
strike is the organization of the oplc
 
05:04:59.638 --> 05:05:00.650 align:start position:0%
strike is the organization of the oplc
itself

05:05:00.650 --> 05:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:05:06.410 --> 05:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
we own that language the decision The
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
Advisory boards
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
is we haven't really had the opportunity
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
to dive into it if they are there are
 
05:05:13.798 --> 05:05:15.050 align:start position:0%
to dive into it if they are there are
repeals

05:05:15.050 --> 05:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen them they must be in the
 
05:05:16.980 --> 05:05:18.708 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen them they must be in the
Senate

05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm talking from last year I believe
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
the medical imagery was transferred from
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
aborted licensing into an Advisory Board
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
and now those licenses
 
05:05:32.930 --> 05:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
are on the repeal list I don't believe
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's related but thank you for
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
the information
 
05:05:39.470 --> 05:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no no no no no no
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
ladies that is not acceptable I am so
 
05:05:51.530 --> 05:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
sorry ladies we know you disagree with
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
the the the we've we've heard your
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
comments thank you uh Paula and then
 
05:06:01.788 --> 05:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
05:06:05.448 --> 05:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
um chairman McGuire um Paula minihan
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association and I do appreciate
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
um stating the importance of their goals
 
05:06:15.288 --> 05:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
and um and representative Grody did a
 
05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
great job summarizing as well we agree
 
05:06:21.050 --> 05:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
um there are benefits
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and and merits to all of this my
 
05:06:25.550 --> 05:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
concern as representative Schmidt
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
indicated putting this in House Bill 2
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
is our concern and we will certainly
 
05:06:31.250 --> 05:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is not your bill I know we will
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
testify on Monday however
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the mirt board on page 155 is being
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
repealed and that was advisory and now
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's being repealed so that is as a
 
05:06:46.490 --> 05:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
concern also um thank you for pulling
 
05:06:48.410 --> 05:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
out the lnas because that is another
 
05:06:51.288 --> 05:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
very big concern to a number of our
 
05:06:51.298 --> 05:06:53.570 align:start position:0%
very big concern to a number of our
associations

05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
associations
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and we are actively working on
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to thank you but
 
05:07:01.730 --> 05:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I just I am just very concerned that
 
05:07:05.690 --> 05:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
this is very important to so many in the
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
state that we need a thorough and like
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
you said representative McGuire this is
 
05:07:13.368 --> 05:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the time um neither
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
does division one this is this requires
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of thoughtful consideration and
 
05:07:22.128 --> 05:07:22.138 align:start position:0%
discussion with all the stakeholders and
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
being having your license repealed is a
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
really big deal and I just think we need
 
05:07:31.010 --> 05:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
to just step back and just have that
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
considerate thoughtful discussion that I
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
know is hard to do right now in this
 
05:07:39.470 --> 05:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
time of year but giving this a little
 
05:07:41.570 --> 05:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
bit more time through through your
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee or another subcommittee
 
05:07:46.368 --> 05:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
however you want to set schedule uh set
 
05:07:49.128 --> 05:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
it up would be much appreciated so I
 
05:07:52.010 --> 05:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share those comments with
 
05:07:52.020 --> 05:07:52.730 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share those comments with
you

05:07:52.730 --> 05:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.050 --> 05:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you we've already pulled out the
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.280 --> 05:08:10.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:08:10.690 --> 05:08:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
Madam chairperson and an honorary board
 
05:08:15.650 --> 05:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
this may be a short testimony my name is
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Joni Menard and I'm the vice chair of
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing and I think based
 
05:08:21.890 --> 05:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
on listening to what Paula just talked
 
05:08:23.810 --> 05:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
about from the hospital Association I'm
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
not going to read my testimony you have
 
05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
a copy of it I do want to make sure that
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
there'll be an opportunity moving
 
05:08:32.570 --> 05:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
forward to revisit the recommendation to
 
05:08:35.570 --> 05:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
de-license or unlicensed the licensed
 
05:08:36.890 --> 05:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
and my last comment is really on behalf
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
of the licensed nursing assistants who
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
work in our state and somebody mentioned
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
it up here before that they are very
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
proud of the work that they do they're
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
proud of their professional licensure
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I worry about the unintended
 
05:08:52.560 --> 05:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
and I worry about the unintended
consequences

05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
05:08:56.090 --> 05:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
of our Workforce which was not the
 
05:08:58.010 --> 05:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
intention of all this the intention was
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
to make reduced barriers to the
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
workforce so anyway thank you for
 
05:09:04.610 --> 05:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
listening to me I appreciate it
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
excellent we are running out of
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard the electrician Steve hey
 
05:09:10.200 --> 05:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
we've heard the electrician Steve hey
you

05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:18.350 --> 05:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Steve rankbot I'm
 
05:09:20.570 --> 05:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
an electrician and ecba just had a
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
question as far as you've talked about
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything that's being removed from
 
05:09:25.128 --> 05:09:25.138 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 or you want to remove from
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
hospital to and deal with in 655. no not
 
05:09:30.590 --> 05:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
in 655.
 
05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
so another we have another bill retained
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
about the regulation of Pharmacists that
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
we are going to use to consider the
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
regulation of Mental Health Professions
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
but yes that was one other part but you
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned page 90 to 110 was going to be
 
05:09:50.570 --> 05:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
dealt with in 655 unless it is in 655.
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
is there anything from 655 that's going
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
to be added to House Bill too so that we
 
05:09:55.610 --> 05:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
can follow because it's been a very
 
05:09:57.890 --> 05:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
confusing procedure no no we want to
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
have we don't want to have the same
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
topic in multiple places because it
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
makes it impossible to keep them synced
 
05:10:07.490 --> 05:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
right so what we see in hospital 2 now
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
is there are you hoping to take out that
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
other part the the finance committee is
 
05:10:15.050 --> 05:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
going to amend house bill due
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
probably very significantly we're only
 
05:10:20.208 --> 05:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
looking at the last hundred Pages here
 
05:10:22.368 --> 05:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
they've got the rest of it they'll there
 
05:10:24.650 --> 05:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
will be massive changes
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
trust me
 
05:10:35.330 --> 05:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is
 
05:10:38.570 --> 05:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth ropp and I'm a licensed
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist in Manchester and um you
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
have my testimony I just wanted to make
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
one quick thing it is true that
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists were considered
 
05:10:49.368 --> 05:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
non-essential during the pandemic but
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
the acupuncture detoxification
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
Specialists many who have that
 
05:10:54.770 --> 05:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
certification were considered essential
 
05:10:56.448 --> 05:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
because they're licensed drug counselors
 
05:10:59.090 --> 05:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
peer counselors recovery coaches social
 
05:11:03.050 --> 05:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
workers and under the law they need two
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
site visits a year from a licensed
 
05:11:07.970 --> 05:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist and I'm one of those
 
05:11:07.980 --> 05:11:09.530 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist and I'm one of those
supervisors

05:11:09.530 --> 05:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
so when the pandemic hit and I could no
 
05:11:15.050 --> 05:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
longer work I emailed my licensing board
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
and said what do you expect of me how am
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
I to fulfill
 
05:11:22.010 --> 05:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's a lot how do I not violate the law
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic and I received no
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
response and I checked for meeting
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
minutes that were never posted and
 
05:11:30.890 --> 05:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
finally I called the governor's office
 
05:11:32.810 --> 05:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
who put me in touch with Lindsey
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Courtney the executive director of oplc
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
and she was the one who looked at the
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
law and said there's nothing in the law
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
that says that you cannot provide
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
General supervision by electronic means
 
05:11:47.570 --> 05:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
and that is how we amended the law so
 
05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
that way we can be available by
 
05:11:52.570 --> 05:11:52.580 align:start position:0%
electronic means whether it be over
 
05:11:57.530 --> 05:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
Zoom or over the phone and so I can't
 
05:12:00.530 --> 05:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
turn to my licensing board for safety or
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
for support I had to go to the executive
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
director of oplc and I'm safer because
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:12:06.718 --> 05:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
of it
um

05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:07.440 --> 05:12:08.930 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:12:08.930 --> 05:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
you have my letter that's my testimony
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
I'll turn this in do you have any
 
05:12:12.958 --> 05:12:14.868 align:start position:0%
I'll turn this in do you have any
questions

05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
I think not okay
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks all right and
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all for coming and and sharing

your your expertise we don't
 
05:12:28.368 --> 05:12:28.378 align:start position:0%
none of us knows all of these
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
professions some of us don't know any of
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
them so it is very important for us to
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
get your input
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say that even if we
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't do what you want us to do we do
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
listen to what you say so with with that
 
05:12:47.448 --> 05:12:47.458 align:start position:0%
we will all work on our amendments to
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill Twins and try to convince
 
05:12:52.970 --> 05:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
Finance to adopt them okay thank you all
 
05:12:56.770 --> 05:12:56.780 align:start position:0%
