01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
questions not so much on the financials
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
but on the
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
operations uh does anyone have any
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
questions they would like to ask the uh
 
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
Administration yes please
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
represent kazinski yeah I was just
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
curious some areas I saw where there was
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
large amounts of paint peeling and stuff
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
it seemed like it was be rather simple
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
to scrape that and paint it you know and
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
give it a more attractive look I some
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
peries looked a little neglected on
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
simple maintenance I was just wondering
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
why that would
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
be sure uh good afternoon Paul Raymond
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner with the New
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections uh
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and uh also
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
have most of you at the facility
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
today I think you know we we make uh
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
strong efforts and the staff makes
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
strong efforts to keep up with uh the
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
Cosmetic look of the facilities as best
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
as possible uh to be fair uh to our
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
staff I think you know it would be the
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
same staff that are essentially fixing
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
some of the maintenance issues right and
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
so we we end up because of our staffing
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
vacancy issues we end up putting a lot
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
on our maintenance team to to maintain
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
the facility and um the Cosmetic look uh
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
and feel inside the prison sometimes has
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
to take uh a seat and wait for us to fix
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
some of the more significant issues like
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
the plumbing issues or um the other
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
matters that that you saw across the
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
facility uh I think the team works hard
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
to try to keep up with the cosmetic
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
things but sometimes there's just so
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
much to maintain a facility that's built
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s or uh some of the facility
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
built in the 80s uh that we just don't
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
have the the Staffing to do it and and a
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
lot of that work would be done by the
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
residents but it still requires our own
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
staff to monitor the residents and
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
observe uh the work that they're
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
pelie hit it one more time there
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
represent One More Time
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay it is the prison facility we have
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
now rated medium security or maximum
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
security it is it is uh a combination so
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's a multi-level security facility so
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
we do have medium custody residence
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
there and we also have maximum security
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
custody residents and how many prisoners
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
do you have for
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
sell uh it depends on the the custody
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
level but the majority of the cells uh
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
have two residents in them two okay and
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
what size of the cells uh I I don't know
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay oh I'm just curious yeah I I'm
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't know the size off hand i'
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
I've been on the internet lately looking
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
up maximum security medium security
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
prisons around the country and what
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
they've been built for and how they've
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'll let it go with that thank

us last week it turn your mic I'm sorry
 
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
Carl thank you Mr chairman uh it says
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
your current population is 1,28 and the
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
capacity is approximately 1,400 so I
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
assume this is still accurate correct
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay and then on the next page it
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
has the incar erated population trending
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
and I noticed figures the last latest
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
figure from 2023 is 1897 is just this
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%

also includes our transitional housing
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
units transitional housing units thank
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
you yes please represent
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question going through
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the medical part of the uh
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility it seems to me that uh a lot of
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
the equipment that you're using is
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
old how come that hasn't been upgraded
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
or is there a plan to upgrade it in the
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
new new Jail uh so prison uh it's a it's
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
a good question we uh we do regularly
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
update our our medical equipment um uh
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
especially when it's needed but I would
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
I would argue too that uh sometimes
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
buying new medical equipment means we
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
need to find space that we simply just
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't have in the current facility right
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
so we may end up using an x-ray machine
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
that uh we've had for years and years
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
because it still fits in the space that
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
we need and it's easier for us to just
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
I I will say a comment um I um I was in
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
there there are always places uh the
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
peeling paint and that sort of thing um
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
that always happen and I understand that
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
things can't be gotten to in a timely
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
manner when at a moment's notice uh the
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
life of view and the residents could
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
flip upside down in that facility I will
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
say that I was extreme
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
impressed by the cleanliness of
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere that we entered and I always
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
look down to the floor and I and I Look
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
to where it joins into the wall space
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
and I I was very impressed at how old
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
the structure is and how well your crew
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
is maintaining it I would also say I was
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
very impressed by um your staff and
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
personnel and the U the condition s that
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
people are working with with without air
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
air handling quality and temperature
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
controls so um we will We Will on our
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
side decide the
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
policy um but I just wanted to say with
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
what you're working for on Aid
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
structures and so forth uh I want to
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%

that we do have incredible staff we work
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
very hard to try to retain them and
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a challenge given the
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
environment that we have but for you to
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
presentation will that be made available
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee we got it last got
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
should be in your should be
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
all right any further
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions um at this time I would like
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
to uh recognize the treasurer uh please
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
come forward um committee is very
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
appreciative that you would take your
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
time to be here it was a request of
 
01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
time to be here it was a request of
several

01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
several
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
members um
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
we um in last year we handled Capital
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
Appropriations it's out of
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
cycle and um we recognize the need we
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
know that this was put in one time
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
before or more more than one time before
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
and now it's before us it's a senate
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
priority here and um I guess we would
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
like to hear if we were to try and find
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
$40 million at five and a half percent
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
that number
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
just just really hit me hard at five and
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
a half percent uh could you give us some
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
Reflections on this please Madam sure
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and thank uh
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
thanks to the members of the committee
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
for asking me to come uh today it is my
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here um so um I
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand um I've had very limited um I
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
guess I will start uh saying that I've
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
um have very brief we had a brief
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
conversation in my office with the with
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner HS and um in another member
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
of her staff a few years back and we
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
started discussing the idea of um how to
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
finance a new prison so I have a a very
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
vague number um of about 400 million at
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
the time um again I don't know how those
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
conversations are going nowadays but
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my basic recollection
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
of um or that's the extent of my
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
discussions about this this particular
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
project um my my my second comment would
 
01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
will be um 40 million is is a large
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be in the middle of the
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
bium um as you know these will add um
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
you already
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
approved 37 million for the bium so this
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
will be if if approved it it will turn
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
into a 177 million um Bond and
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
authorization for the banum so that kind
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
of uh changes the structure of how we
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
typically budget that service uh we
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
count on the idea that you will stay
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
within the 120
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
million um you know plus or minus last
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
time it was 137 million and then we
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
count on sometimes in the middle of the
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
banum you will approve a few small
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
projects and those don't typically
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
impact um our bond end so an
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
authorization of um this amount you know
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
it we we essentially didn't budget those
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
service for for this amount so we will
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
have to adjust that um so again those
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
are things that you already know um the
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
state does have the capacity to bond a
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
little more there's no doubt I think um
 
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
probably and and I thank you for
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
bringing me to this conversation just
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
because this is a again a project that
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
will cost
 
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
will cost
[Music]

01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you can't fund it all at once or you
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
will have to think about how you want to
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
finance this project whether it's going
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
to be over a period of several years or
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
how you will want to fund this project
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to the rest of the projects
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
that you already consider during the
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
bayum um because this particular
 
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
um so so again going back to your
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
question about this bill I think I I
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
will I I would be will normally be
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
concerned with an amount like this one
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
40 million it's not like the state can't
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
afford it I think the state can't afford
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
it um we will have to probably if we're
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
off with that service it would be
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
probably a trip for me to go to fiscal
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee and say well we may need a
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
little more for that service and going
 
01:50:23.679 --> 01:50:25.430 align:start position:0%
little more for that service and going
forward

01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um again if by if if if the decisions
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
are that that this committee and the
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislature will move away from the
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
typical structure of 120
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
million during the banum then again we
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
will have to change our projections or
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that sort of projections as as you all
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
know um the de affordability study that
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
we prepare our Deb projections what we
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
present to um to you all the legislature
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
to the rating agencies is all based on
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
that structure so um if we were to
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
change the structure a bit we just need
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
to know that and and try to bake it in
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
to to determine those calculations but
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
but again I think at one time for an
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
emergency reasons for a particular
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
reason yes it will increase that service
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
um um it's just it's just one of those
 
01:51:19.069 --> 01:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's just this large appropriation
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
the mum can definitely change the
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
structure of how we do things so that's
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
my my initial comment um I think another
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
another point that I would like to just
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
um share with you is since this project
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
is again it's going to be costly um this
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
facility um I will imagine it will last
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
for another 100 years um so perhaps
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
conservation will be given could be
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
given to a different structure of
 
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
financing for this we typically Bond a
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
lot all of the coule projects are based
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
on a 20-year amortization schedule um
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
this facility again because of the life
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
of this this asset will be longer than a
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
typical asset you know a different
 
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
structure could be considered so it
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
could be like this particular project
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
could be evaluated differently than um
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of your projects that you
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
approve um you know on a regular basis I
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
think um again this because of the
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
nature of the this facility it is not a
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
typical Capital project it's a it's a
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's a one time project that you
 
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
probably do um I don't know when you'll
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know if you end up building this one
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
what will be the next one around so
 
01:52:37.069 --> 01:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
again I I guess my my comment is uh I
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
guess a particular or different
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
consideration we given to to to
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
financing um a project like this one so
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
those are my initial comments again I I
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
think is I think is again the the the
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
the state can afford
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
well proba take take it back uh in terms
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
of bonding capacity I think we could
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
bond a little more you know the cost
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
based on the uh fiscal fiscal note the
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
cost of debt service that it will it
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
will add to our to our budget so you
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
know whether we're going to have enough
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
revenues to cover the debt service
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's a separate conversation I don't
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
have the answer right now um again
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
because of the way revenues are coming
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
in and and all of the various needs and
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
how the um when the operting budget was
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
crafted this additional bonding was not
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
considered so um again but in terms of
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
bonding capacity the state does have the
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
capacity to include this one time um if
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
you wanted to bond this for a million um
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
but again all of the other points that I
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
made I just is I think is is just so you
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
can consider everything um as part of
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
your decision of how to how to finance
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
this this project thank you before I
 
01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
open it up to committee questions so if
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
if I remember
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
reading um whether it was our bond
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
rating we were we were recently upgraded
 
01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
rating we were we were recently upgraded
I

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe uh with with this with this 40
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
million dollar jeopardize any of that no
 
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
not at all I think um I think what with
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
the rate and upgrade um means is that
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
the state has done a really good job
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
with all of the decisions and obviously
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's thanks to all of you and your
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
work um in terms of you know when it
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
comes to capital projects and the way
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
that we uh we Finance uh and the state
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
the state has had a very
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
um essentially a very good policy and
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
practice of how how you have very low de
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know debt compared to your revenues
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
compared to your assets um so that you
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
know the way one of the that was that
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
that that has been one of the uh trends
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
of our state to have to the again the
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
way um the state handles um financing
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
and bonding um so so this will not
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't jeopardize uh the rating um but
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
again it's all about the state has a
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
capacity to bond a little more right now
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
um it's just it will be helpful for me
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
to understand um again if you decide to
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
change our structure that we've had had
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
over the years and and we will just have
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
to take that back and and and just
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
consider that as as part of our future
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
projections of debt thank you for that
 
01:55:31.639 --> 01:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
projections of debt thank you for that
represent

01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr
 
01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure if this question
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
will be towards the the chairman or to
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
you so I'm just gonna ask um typically
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
through our capital budget that we do uh
 
01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.990 align:start position:0%
through our capital budget that we do uh
every

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:53.830 align:start position:0%
every
two

01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
years uh it's a typically 120 million in
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
in that area yes so if this is approved
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
would it now
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
we see what I'm asking are we yeah I I
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
believe it's an additional we're not I
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that and perhaps you know
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
this I don't know the answer that I
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we're going to open
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
the capital budget to amend this we're
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
just simply looking to add a new project
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
and it typically would come through the
 
01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
odd year which it didn't so this is high
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
This is highly unusual we have we had an
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation in to do this I believe in
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
the last capital budget or the budget
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
before and it was
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
removed and so now it now it appears to
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate that uh it's it's time to act
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
on this am I incorrect with it it would
 
01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:54.510 align:start position:0%
be a
[Music]

01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
new correct this would be a new capital
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation so is a is is so what was
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
already approved for the banum again we
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
typically recommend about 120 million
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
for bium but during the last bium it was
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
137 because it was I believe it was 120
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
plus another 17 million for the
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
University system and I remember this
 
01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee asking me if that was okay and
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
and and it is always a policy decision
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
right but in terms terms of impacting
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
any of our numbers it didn't impact our
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
numbers so again so the capital budget
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
um was 137 million so this 40 will be an
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
followup and looking at uh different
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
ways of financing such a large project
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
would it
 
01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
would it
be

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
considered uh when it wants this 40
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
million and to design is done and then
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
they go in and ask for the money to
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
actually build the prison could we
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
retake an extra 40 million and retire
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
that Bond early so that and wrap it up
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a larger
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
expense on the actual build to the
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
prison and so it it it to me would make
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
sense You' just retire your your first
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
loan loan and add it to the second
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
because yes thank you for that question
 
01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
so we typically don't retire debt so
 
01:58:36.069 --> 01:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
when we issue bonds
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
um generally those the for the first 10
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
years we can't call those bonds those we
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
need to maintain those bonds and pay
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
investors during the first 10 years
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
during the second 10 years if we see an
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to essentially refinance
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
those those loans if the rates and the
 
01:58:55.069 --> 01:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
market and the conditions are
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate um we we are able to
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
consider um refunding those those bonds
 
01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
so I guess the the initial your initial
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
question we we can't really retire for
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
the first 10 years during the second
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
years's uh during the I'm sorry during
 
01:59:13.709 --> 01:59:13.719 align:start position:0%
this um last 10 years of a bond we could
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
again we could re refund those bonds but
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
only if the conditions um are are
 
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh for for to be able to do
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
that I think the other piece that I
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say so the
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
5.5% that our chairman mentioned that
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
was an estimate that we typically use we
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
use a 5% estimate the this time around
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
we use a five it was it's part of our
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
templates when we prepar fiscal notes we
 
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
just used a
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
5.5% because we weren't sure how the
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
rates were going to behave um for the
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
most part
 
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
um the the rates have been okay but what
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
happens is we we we always pay 5% to
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
investors so the the coupon is always 5%
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
um so um just to again just a a point
 
02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
relative to that rate
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that thank you yes
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jack thank you Mr
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you treasure it's
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to see you um my
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
question is in the same area if we were
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
to do this uh and then we were to get to
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
next year's capital budget would we
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
expect the 120 million recommendation to
 
02:00:27.069 --> 02:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
be adjusted downward because we've done
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
this extra
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
amount good point so so it will all
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
depend on how you want to handle your
 
02:00:38.069 --> 02:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
so so so so again typically we we will
 
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
say around the 120 million
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation um you know plus or minus
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
um you could you you could again it just
 
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
all the depends how you want to finance
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
this particular project if you're going
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
to do it over a period of five years 10
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
years um you could perfectly add you
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
know the way the same way you do it with
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
the university system you can do 20
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
million 50 million over period of time
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you you you could potentially reduce
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
your 120 million and just include that
 
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
project as part of your overall capital
 
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
budget or you already will know that you
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
want to approve 120 million
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
plus an addition amount that will be um
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know targeted for this for this
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
project so depending on how you want to
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
finance this this project and how soon
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to be built and all of that
 
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
and again those are the details I don't
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
know in terms of um I haven't had a
 
02:01:40.510 --> 02:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
recent conversation with Department to
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
to know how those those um you know that
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
plan is going to to to know that I guess
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
the the other pieces instead of um um
 
02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
instead of um again my my comment about
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
this project being different is perhaps
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
it could be structured in a way that is
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
is it would be an a modication of 30
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
years rather than 20 years so you just
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's all about how to you know be
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
be a little less painful for the budget
 
02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
how you pay that debt service over time
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
thank you further qu represent beer
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
addressing my question um in line with
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh with what the representative just
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
said right now if if next year you're
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
going to usually you caution us or you
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
give us advice and how you want us to do
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
things or how you think the governor
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
will like us to do
 
02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
things are we going to be able to go
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
ahead with let's say 120 next year right
 
02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
off or are you going to caution us
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
because before you've told us how much
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
debt we have it could affect our rate
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then affect our bonding and and
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
things so would you anticipate being
 
02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:50.830 align:start position:0%
things so would you anticipate being
your

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation yeah no thank you for the
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
question so so again we we prepared the
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
Deb affordability study and um I'm I'm
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
not sure if you had a an opportunity to
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
review that study but what the study
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
does is e we we essentially project that
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
over the next four bayna you will
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
approve around 120 million for the banum
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
so so what that does it allows us to so
 
02:03:20.189 --> 02:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
we project we project that you will bond
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
that those amounts we also project uh
 
02:03:25.709 --> 02:03:25.719 align:start position:0%
revenues over time and and so we we
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
prepared this study where we evaluate
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
how Debt Service is going to look over
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
the next six years and and and so that
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
gives us an understanding of you know
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
how our debt is our debt service is
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to look over
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
time so so I guess to to answer your
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
question the recommendation continues to
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
be the same about 120 million over the
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
over the
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
vium and um but again if you want to
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
during your your process if you end up
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
bonding a little more or a little less
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
it won't impact our numbers that much
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to share that study
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
again with you because it really what
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
that does is is just it just shows our
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
projections um the good news about those
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
projections is if you as this committee
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the legislature and the governor
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
they always stay around those
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations the good news is that it
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
really has worked for the state like I
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
said based you know the rating agency
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
was really like our our policies our our
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
debt policies and and the way we've
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
managed our debt um and and because of
 
02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:29.719 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason we you know our
 
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
ratings are are as strong as they are
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
today and I hope I answer your question
 
02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
kind of I can follow up please thank you
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
um so right now if this 40 million's
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
included in the hund you said the 37 we
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
already did so that's
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
177 so um does that have the potential
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
to affect our bonding at all because
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
before again we've always been cautioned
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
about going over the minimum amount what
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
he does is again the the state has a
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
capacity to bond meaning we typically
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
review the the capacity based on the
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
revenues because revenues have been so
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
strong over time right now we definitely
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
have a capacity to bond a little more I
 
02:05:15.149 --> 02:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
think the tricky part will be when
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to pay that Debt Service
 
02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the operating budget
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
and we want to add more Debt Service and
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
when we have the the other side of the
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
budget saying you need to stay within
 
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
this you know and this is It's it gets
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
paid with General funds so again that's
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
does you know how you pay your debt
 
02:05:34.109 --> 02:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
service over time is what really should
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
be part of your consideration um you
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
know as part of you know how much you
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
Bond and and and like I said if you if
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
you you typically stay within those
 
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations it hasn't been a problem
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
for the state um adding more Debt
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
Service I'm not saying it's a problem
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's just something that needs to be
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the the next
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
operating budget when we have to put
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
that together thank you represent Mills
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
my question I just want to recap what I
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
think I've heard for the rest of the
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee and it sounded to me as if we
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
can take this 40 million right now and
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
add it to our current
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
137 limit without affecting any of our
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
ratings or any concerns about paying it
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
back however moving forward with our
 
02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:23.750 align:start position:0%
back however moving forward with our
normal

02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
120 million bonding every by enum we
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
would look at this project separately
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
call it 500 million that it's going to
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
take and rather than Bond it like our
 
02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.470 align:start position:0%
take and rather than Bond it like our
normal

02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
120 take this and treat it separately
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
and still included in 120 but have the
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
500 million done over a 30-year a
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
40-year period or something like that so
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't affect us with our whole
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
total 120 am I close to hearing that
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
correctly yes that you said we should
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
actually consider it bonding at a
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
different on a different time level
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
different structure yes structure corre
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
I so yes that's correct so this you
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
could this this this committee and and
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
it could be it will be a policy decision
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
to treat this project separately and it
 
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.069 align:start position:0%
to treat this project separately and it
wouldn't

02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
um that way we will know how we will
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
fund it over time
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
you you could even consider that
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
separately and then still stay within
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
120 million again I think the question
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
is if you wanted to take this project
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
and and and do it not not as part of the
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget um we will have to just
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
look at that structure and how that will
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
look and be added to the typical 120
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
million so that what you typically
 
02:07:46.350 --> 02:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
review all of the multiple projects that
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
come before you are not impacted so yes
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
we could look at this project separately
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
and and and review the options for finan
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
in this project follow up yeah just a
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
follow up so we have
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I will confirm that we do have
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
options okay how to pay it is going to
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
be over time and and and yes it could be
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
all planned and I think um you know
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
project like this one if if it's
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
structured and planned accordingly I
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
think again we just need to all be
 
02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this including the
 
02:08:27.149 --> 02:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
governor I mean perhaps additional
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
conversations with the governor's office
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
how they they thought about how to fund
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
this or Finance this this project you
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
know will be helpful but I think it will
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
be helpful to have this project as a
 
02:08:39.549 --> 02:08:39.559 align:start position:0%
separate conversation I thank I think I
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
think this committee's concern was
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
always that we know the 40 million is
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
just the tip of the iceberg and what are
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
we going to be we don't want to just
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
toss 40 million and find out that we
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
can't come up with 500 million to finish
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
it so thank you very much thank you rep
 
02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:58.189 align:start position:0%
it so thank you very much thank you rep
shev

02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
boy thank you Mr chairman and I don't
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
know if this has been addressed please
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
Ru me out of order if my question is
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um but the 5.5 that you
 
02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
have in the bill Municipal Bond Bank
 
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
right now is 3.8 at 20 years I I chare a
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund where the current rate is at
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
at 2.8 depending on a 20 or 30 of fix
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the nature of the project
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
um for projects with this thing is it
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
done differently as opposed to going
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
through a bond bank I I got your
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
testimony previously that you're you're
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
basing it on on past experiences I guess
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at to what venue would we be
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
potentially be looking at at bonding yes
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
so we we issue the bonds the state
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
issues the bonds uh we use a 5%
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
um 5% as part of the the assumptions
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
because it's what it's a coer that we
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
pay to investors so when we budget
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
agencies have to consider that 5%
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
because that's really what we pay to
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
investors every time we pay de service
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
in term of in terms of the actual yield
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
what you know what you know right now we
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
just we just issue bonds we're actually
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
closing on the bonds tomorrow um the the
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
actual yield that we received for this
 
02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
last sale was was
 
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
3.4% what that means is over time it
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
will really cost us about 3.4% % but
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
what we have to pay to investors is
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
5% um so that's the typical bonding
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
structure that we have it's just
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
agencies need to budget the amount that
 
02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
we have to pay for thatb service um and
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
what that means in terms of that that
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um we get to bond a little less of what
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
we let's say we need um $70 million in
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
proceeds but investors are willing to
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
pay as a Prem so we end up bonding or
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
borrowing 60 million instead so that's
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
the that's the difference between you
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
know when we want to pay a higher coupon
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
to investors and the actual cost of our
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
of our borrowing and that's that's that
 
02:11:07.709 --> 02:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
actually 3.4% right now is a very good
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
very good uh rate thank you any further
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions U yes please represent vulner
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a quick question the bonds
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we issue are they uh exempt from
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
federal income tax and are they exempt
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
from the state indd tax yes they are
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes please thank you Mr
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so for right now for
 
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
the for the this proposal for the
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
engineering architectural plans uh
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
programming and construction documents
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
we have the capacity right now for about
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
40 million to
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
bond we we could add that we we could
 
02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
add it yes thank you thank you any
 
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes please representative kazinski
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
Newton thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh first I would
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
like to congratulate you on the Stella
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
job you do with the state's finances I
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
feel very comfortable when you come and
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
testify I feel that uh very confident
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
that you know what you're doing thank
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
you um this question may or may not be
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
for you um when I look at the number
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're talking approximately 500
 
02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
million for a new jail and 40 million
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
for the architectural design Etc that
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
seems like a rather high
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
percentage what is that like seven or
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
eight% for architectural for the $500
 
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
million plan again I'm not familiar with
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the details of the plan of the cost of
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
the project right now does does
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
um so yes I will probably agree with you
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of um you know your
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
question maybe the department could
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
more helpful there follow up uh please I
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
just I just want to tell the
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative though that Public Works
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
is the opinion that that the planning is
 
02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
typically 10% of the build so 10% 10% so
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
please Contin do do you ever when
 
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
bonding is being asked to be done do you
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
ever look at the numbers and say gee
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers don't quite add up
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
it seems rather steeper is that not your
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
your purview we don't typically get into
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
the details of the project cost um um
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
the Departments work with various
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
experts on on how to do that as part of
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process um I know the
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're all involved and over seeing the
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
cost the governor's office so we
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
typically don't get involved um you know
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
during that part of you know the the the
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of the project uh we we we are
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for the financing of of of
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
the projects um so yeah so to answer
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
your question we we don't get involved
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
in that thank you okay thank you any
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
further questions for the treasurer yes
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
please representative kazinski thank you
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
um just to be clear we're being asked to
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
approve 40 million but in I correct
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
understand the department of Prisons has
 
02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:17.559 align:start position:0%
10 million extra in addition to this so
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're talking about spending 50
 
02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:21.149 align:start position:0%
they're talking about spending 50
million

02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
is that cor I I don't I don't know the
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
answer to that and perhaps when we're
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
finished with the treasurer we could we
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
could bring the prisons up and we'll
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
we'll get that answer for you is there
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
anything else at this point in time for
 
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.589 align:start position:0%
anything else at this point in time for
the

02:14:34.589 --> 02:14:34.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
treasurer Madam I thank you so much for
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
adjusting your schedule and coming and
 
02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
being with us today absolutely thank you
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you again for coming
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
forward and perhaps you could ask answer
 
02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:01.559 align:start position:0%
the rep representative's question yes uh
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
my pleasure to be back and appreciate
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
the question so uh House Bill two uh
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
originally the request was 450 million
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
that was reduced down to 10 million we
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
received 10 million in the last house
 
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
bill two and now we are seeking the rest
 
02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
of that 50 million so that 50 million
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
would be the estimated 10 % as the
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
chairman said of the total cost although
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
prior to my testimony last week we had
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
gotten a number from public works at the
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
which put the total cost just over
 
02:15:41.629 --> 02:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
600 uh 600 million so it was it it was
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
584 million plus the 50 million for the
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
design and
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
testing thank you is there a followup
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
question question represent Kinski now
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you've heard
 
02:15:59.470 --> 02:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
that represent Newton if I could um does
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
it that just 10% that seems kind of high
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're working at a new Nursing
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
Home in straford county and the
 
02:16:09.549 --> 02:16:09.559 align:start position:0%
engineering cost Etc came in at between
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
3.5 and
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
3.75% but that was only a $200 million
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
nursing home so it just seems like why
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
is this jail costing so so much more
 
02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
percentage wise for what's being built I
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
have trouble grasping that sure I think
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
the I think the big reason is because it
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
is a prison we we are designing a a
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
structure that is that is not your
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
typical housing structure uh there are
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
extreme costs that go into uh designing
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
and uh building a prison just one
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
example the uh the cost today to replace
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
windows in our prison is $220,000 per
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
window um you're you're not building a
 
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
house or any residential structure at
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per
 
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
window and if if I could before I go
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
back to the follow-up
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
question um it's public works that's
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
pulling this this proposal together with
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
input from your department correct
 
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
because in the past there have been
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
some correct we we got the number from
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
Public Works that we didn't come up with
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
the number of how much it's going to
 
02:17:21.389 --> 02:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
cost to build this present
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
that came from the Department of
 
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Public Works
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay before I do rep Jack was there a
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up question Gentlemen please well
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
um maybe this would be a little
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
different but while we were here
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
earlier um I looked up some figures and
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
what I see like say for instance
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
Nebraska they're building a 1500 bed
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
prison for 350 million and Alabama is
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
doing a 4,000 bed for 973 million
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
lenworth is going to get replaced the,
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
1400 bid with 340 sta uh 340 staff for
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
like 530 million so I I was just
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
wondering how this this 600 million
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
seems excessive to compared to what's
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
these are all maximum security
 
02:18:13.709 --> 02:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
prisons I I can't speak to the the
 
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
square footage number that Public Works
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
gave us for the number um and I don't
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
know how they came up with with that
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
number where we're using the figure that
 
02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
they gave us based off of their
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
estimation uh on a a price per square
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
foot I believe it was
 
02:18:32.399 --> 02:18:33.950 align:start position:0%
foot I believe it was
1,080

02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
1,080
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
$1,070 per square foot was the number
 
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
that Public Works gave us I'm sorry that
 
02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:40.589 align:start position:0%
that Public Works gave us I'm sorry that
was

02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
$170 per square foot 1,70 I was going to
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
say I didn't that first number didn't
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
sound right 1,000 thank you um and and I
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
will come back to you repr jack so if if
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is um for $40,000
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's $10,000 that hasn't been spent
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
and and during the process if if um if
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
the process were to go swimmingly
 
02:19:12.669 --> 02:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
well um there may not there in those
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
there may not be a need to expend all of
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
those or by the end of that we might
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
come to a conclusion that there is an
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
alternative that would be less than 6
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
600 absolutely just as an example the
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire Correctional
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
Facility uh was estimated to be at $39
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
million granted that was 25 26 years ago
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh the cost came out to about 29 million
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
when we were done with the or I'm sorry
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
at the at the end of RFP and bidding the
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
the cost was around 29 million so there
 
02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
was a $10 million savings just as
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
example of that
 
02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
um I will forewarn you though uh that
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
company did go bankrupt after building
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
the Northern New Hampshire Correctional
 
02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
Facility thank you represent Jack uh
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman back to my
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
represent Jack thank you thank you do we
 
02:20:10.349 --> 02:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
know uh what year the this the uh design
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
might be completed and you would be
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
ready to come back for construction
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
funding I don't know uh I I said on the
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
tour we were estimating between six and
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
10 years uh for for when we'd be
 
02:20:27.309 --> 02:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
building a new prison but I don't know
 
02:20:29.710 --> 02:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
what the time frame I think you know
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
that realistically how how quickly we
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
could do it would would come uh from the
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislature who sets that policy for us
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not actually my question if
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
I could okay then I misunderstood I'm
 
02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
sorry the first step is to do the design
 
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
sure what year do we expect the design
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
to be finished and then you would ask
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
for construction funding gotcha we uh as
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
soon as we get the the 50 million we
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
plan to put that out and start working
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
on that so I would anticipate that we
 
02:20:59.309 --> 02:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
would have a design uh ready for the
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
team within a
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
year okay R
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
shamb thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:21:09.790 --> 02:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh the the
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
question I have is would you say
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
that when you send this out to have it
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
design that you have limited amount of
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
architectural firm terms that can design
 
02:21:26.349 --> 02:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
to the level of security that is needed
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
for a facility like
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
this correct there's only there's only a
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
handful of companies that that uh across
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
the country that build and design or
 
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
design uh maximum security presence and
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
one followup please and would you say
 
02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
that the design has to incorporate all
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
the conceptual lawsuits that could be uh
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
prevented in the
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
future based on the design so they're
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually trying to design out
 
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuits which would be a cost savings I
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
think that's certainly something we
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll consider in the design absolutely
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
um uh I think you know the the biggest
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue we have right now is is we have a
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
facility that does not facilitate
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and is not Ada compant
 
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of our biggest issues that
 
02:22:24.429 --> 02:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
we're running into today right uh
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
eliminating the ADA compliance issues
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
will be a huge step in the right
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
direction for the Department of
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
Corrections thank
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
you yes represent boy thank you Mr
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
question what is the minimum
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
cost to put out to request to put out
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
the bit to an architectural firm to
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
design because hb2 is already allocated
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
$10 million I would have thought that
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
the process would have already been
 
02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
begun and that the additional bonding
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
requests is meant to amplify the next
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
steps in in pushing forward and in
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
building this new facility so I'm just
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
curious to know yeah I I appreciate that
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
question I I uh I know I've heard the
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
answer to it I I can't answer it myself
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call on uh somebody from the
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
team that I know would be able to answer
 
02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:19.030 align:start position:0%
team that I know would be able to answer
that

02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.269 --> 02:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Heidi laramy
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of logistics for
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Correction so I
 
02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
oversee the capital
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
projects um so um I'm sorry the design
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
so the 10 million that we were initially
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
allocated we are actually in the process
 
02:23:45.269 --> 02:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
with an engineering firm um that
 
02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
contract is in process the approval
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
process right now so we do have a design
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
firm select Ed um with the assistance of
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
Public Works um they assisted in finding
 
02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
this firm and this firm is going to be
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
looking at um things like sighting site
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation site testing um you know what
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
what size we can build where it's going
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be located um so all these things are
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
going to be in the initial um site
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
design with the 10 million so the
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional 40 million will be to design
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
the actual structure
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
yes than Mr chairman thank thank you
 
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
could I ask you to stay seated Madam I
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
may have a
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
question from the previous question that
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
I hear correctly saying that once if you
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
get the funding the 40 million you think
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
within a year you'll have a set of
 
02:24:42.359 --> 02:24:43.630 align:start position:0%
within a year you'll have a set of
construction

02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
plans hopefully within one to two years
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
one to two years yeah okay thank you
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay yes please represent
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
no yes thank you on on that same line
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
going back to I think it was
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jack who asked so how
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
what would be the the number of years
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
involved in getting a new facility done
 
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I didn't understand if it would be
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
six to 10 for completion if everything
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
went really terrific to get something
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.389 --> 02:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
2034 yes I think I our Target would be
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
we would be in a new facility and a
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
replacement facility within that six to
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
10 year time
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
frame okay and and in the interim while
 
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
design engineering was going on and a
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
new one may or may be under construction
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
there would still be a certain amount of
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
upkeep with what you've got right now
 
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
correct the handout I provided last week
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
outlined we anticipate in the next 10
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
years spending upwards of over $300
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
million close it of $400 million in just
 
02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement projects and
 
02:26:05.469 --> 02:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the facility itself thank
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions um I'm I just have a design
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
question and
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps when when when you have your
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
your um
 
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
study done youve you've drawn up and
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're starting to move to
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
construction and um I'm going to assume
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to stay in on the same
 
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
property we own it we have a large large
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh campus there available to us is is
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
there any thought that this will be
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
built somewhat sectional and move some
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
of the population in and tear down and
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
move some other population in because
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm worried about the the much
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
larger expense and that that's a more
 
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
costly Pro process I understand that but
 
02:26:59.309 --> 02:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
is something like that under under
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
consideration we have had some of those
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
discussions I think the the the biggest
 
02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
issue from from our standpoint is uh is
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing two facilities at that point
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
and then also uh all of the logistical
 
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
needs to operate two facilities even
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
though they'd be nearby um you know I
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to map out what that
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
would look like because the concern of
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
operating for example two kitchens or
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
two Health Care Centers or uh two
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
educational centers could impact our
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
capabilities to run any at all okay
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I want to thank you both
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah so I will uh about a
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
gavel we will close this work session we
 
02:27:51.269 --> 02:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
still need to uh schedu the executive
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
session on this this is a this is
 
02:27:54.439 --> 02:27:56.269 align:start position:0%
session on this this is a this is
scheduled

02:27:56.269 --> 02:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
right executive session oh I apologize I
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have that in front of me okay all
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
right so with
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
late so we will now move into uh the
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
time being 150
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
7 uh we will now move into the executive
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 476 making a
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation Department of
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
Corrections toward the replacement of
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
men do we have a do we want to have a
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on where we go here or I
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be willing to accept a motion at
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Newton yeah I'm uh I
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
didn't make the last meeting I apologize
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
for that I had severely flooded seller I
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
had to deal with um why
 
02:29:10.349 --> 02:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
now why now we're almost at the end of
 
02:29:10.359 --> 02:29:11.910 align:start position:0%
now why now we're almost at the end of
the

02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
bium we've got we heard representative
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
wer tell us that we spent a bunch of
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
money we didn't have I like the fact
 
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
fact that we're bonding it is the only
 
02:29:23.070 --> 02:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
thing that makes it a little different
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
but why are we doing this now and not
 
02:29:30.750 --> 02:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
budget my my understanding that the need
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
has risen to a
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
point um and my additional understanding
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
is that the $10 million that's been
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated is not enough to handle
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
that need and it's it's being brought
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
forward I've had I've had a convers
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
ation uh with representative W on wer on
 
02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:55.790 align:start position:0%
ation uh with representative W on wer on
this

02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
um I've not had that comment I've not
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
had that return on that comment at this
 
02:30:09.269 --> 02:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
time yes representative Faulkner so my
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that in fact they put
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
this request in a year ago last year
 
02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:13.750 align:start position:0%
this request in a year ago last year
last

02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
term that it was originally going to be
 
02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
funded out of hb2
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
through General funds is that correct
 
02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
and they just cut that down to 10 so now
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's not really the last minute thing
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's basically going to follow up on
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
what was
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
reduced reduced appropriation last
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.269 --> 02:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
you repent
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
boy thank you Mr chairman and I um I
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
guess I want to amplify representative
 
02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
Newton's comments I I we had this place
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
in hb2 last year and if somebody please
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
correct me who's the director of
 
02:31:02.269 --> 02:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
Corrections the woman that that
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
testified last year excuse me Helen
 
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
Helen Helen Hanks thank you commissioner
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
Hanks um you know we during that
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
testimony last year we heard a lot of we
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of anecdotes from her and
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
from her staff as to the condition of
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
the prison we saw pictures of what the
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
kitchen facility looks like we've we
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
know that they've got um that they're
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to repair the the sewage problem
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to re reconfigure the
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that allows the the um
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the waste to be able to to leave
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
from that from that facility and not
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
have that situation back up
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
so I hate to use the word dire Mr
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
chairman but but we knew about this last
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
year we took appropriate steps we we put
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
the 50 million in the budget why why it
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
was moved I I don't know the answer to
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
that particular question and the the
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
only Redeeming Grace again to amplify
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative num now we're looking at
 
02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
a bonding issue
 
02:32:03.150 --> 02:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
which you know being a former Town
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
counselor I I would rather pay cash for
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
something than to whip out the credit
 
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
card that that has always been my
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
Approach at at having served at the
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
local level in tackling problems at the
 
02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
municipal level and now being grown up
 
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
and sitting at this table it's it's a
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different perspective
 
02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
but even still you know this this this
 
02:32:23.630 --> 02:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee made a commitment to begin the
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
process by paying for a cash so I'm you
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
know I I understand the need I
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
understand that why why they're coming
 
02:32:35.230 --> 02:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
to us right now I'm I'm inclined to air
 
02:32:37.269 --> 02:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
on the side of what our what the good
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
state treasur has communicated to us I
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't think the Senate would have sent
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
over to us if they didn't feel that they
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
could uh be able to make those
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
particular numbers work in the grant
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
scheme of things but I'm I I just
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
publicly I don't like it because we had
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Apple presented to us last year and
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't buy from the Apple last
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
year so that's the thing that I'm kind
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
of I'm kind of it's it's garring at me
 
02:33:02.590 --> 02:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
right now Mr chairman is that you know
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
we could have we could have done the
 
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
right thing and appropriated the money
 
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to using the credit card so
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
not I it's it's needed that that entire
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
place needs needs an overhaul I think
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement on that um and it
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
should have been done years ago the fact
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at a project you know
 
02:33:23.269 --> 02:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's looking it's going to take 10
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
years to to build this AT3 to $400
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
million we should have been should have
 
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
been doing this years ago so anyway I
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate you let me speak thank you Mr
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could could have should
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
have and we
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
I they um there are there are needs in
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
the state um that um cost estimates that
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
keep coming back to us
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
that are enormously larger than what was
 
02:33:54.990 --> 02:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward I I I think of the
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
ventilation system at the police
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
standards I think of the uh project to
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
replace the gondola Canon
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
Mountain um with the the
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
reason so at the same point if if we
 
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
don't move forward with good planning
 
02:34:18.429 --> 02:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
issue we we are we are the policy
 
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee here and then it will go to
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
finance and finance then will have will
 
02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
have their say whether at that point in
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
time uh it's something they they want to
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
back or not back and then and then the
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
proposal will come back to us at the
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
house and we will we will then cast our
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
our second vote on it so I I myself am
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
not happy to be looking at a capital
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the second year here
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
but but things happen and this is one
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of those that uh uh
 
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
we are going to consider whether we do
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
that today or whether we postpone this
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
decision another day or so but it's also
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
an early bill um that we need to uh to
 
02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
move out of here so that it can go to
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
finance I would prefer to continue the
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
discussion and then I'm going to call
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
for a caucus before we go any further
 
02:35:26.349 --> 02:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
than this represent boy I was going to
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
move approval and I'll follow your lead
 
02:35:32.269 --> 02:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you re shamon I'll
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
come back to the other uh yes I I will
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
um the I don't like what's going on
 
02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
here but because of my faith in the
 
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
treasur and saying that it's not going
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
to be the end of the world if we do it
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
and if you feel we have to do it I will
 
02:35:57.269 --> 02:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
support the passing it on to the finance
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
but I disagree that where we are a
 
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
policy committee but as a representative
 
02:36:04.910 --> 02:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
as a conservative representative money
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
matters to me and I like to see it spent
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
well and spent the best for all of my my
 
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
constituents and that's a job we all
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
have and that's why there's great
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
hesitancy on my part but I will tell
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
everybody I will will support bringing
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
this forward at this time come back to
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
comment my general comment that the
 
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer did state that right now at
 
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.630 align:start position:0%
treasurer did state that right now at
what

02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
5.5% uh we could do we could bond this
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
40 million and for the needs that we've
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
everybody has discussed so far and for
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
the uh for the history of what's been
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
going on and knowing again with every
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
how when this should have been done and
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
what you just said in ition going
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
forward they're planning on spending 300
 
02:36:55.950 --> 02:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
million more to for maintenance and uh
 
02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Bas and bandages in a sense to keep
 
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
the facility going and one final thing
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
bringing prospective employee in there
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
to look around for for a Corrections
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
job uh is probably a difficult task uh
 
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's you know you can you can feel what
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
you want about the residents there but
 
02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
we have state employees that have to
 
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
show up there every day with the
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
mandatory at times over time time and
 
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
trying to find new employees and having
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
a new facility will be able to attract
 
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
new Corrections personnel and may be
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
able to reduce the overtime May so I'll
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
leave I'll leave it at that thank you r
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
f wanted to add that we've been talking
 
02:37:41.070 --> 02:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
about $120 million for as long as I've
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
been here and that's been eight years
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
over that period of time construction
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up stock market Market's
 
02:37:53.309 --> 02:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
gone up our tax base has gone
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
up if we're still talking about 120 it
 
02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
means we're we're we're we're buying
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
less each year and if this is what kind
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
of causes us to rethink that $120
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
million limit I think that's high time
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
but I think I don't think we're gon to I
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it's good for the state to
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
be spending less and less in terms of
 
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
real buying power each year on investing
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
in our future so I'm I'm quite
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this addition repent
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
berer I was just going to make the same
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of comment was do we include this
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
in that 120 or do we expand
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
120 to
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
the 140 150 cap uh is that part of all
 
02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
this decision also is that a side
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
decision that's that's a that's future
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
and finance will will take up that
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
question going forward we have we have
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
in past years uh the university system
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I I won't have the right numbers for
 
02:39:01.230 --> 02:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
you but keep I think was their last
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
project and it
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
was0 or $120 million and that
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation was broken out over over
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
three banum or longer and so that number
 
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
was plugged in and it was it's it's one
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
of those outstanding obligations that's
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
sitting out there like this 40 million
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
will be that the treasurer will then try
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
and reel in at at what that number and
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
we and and this is lame in conversation
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
so I apologize I know how to dig in the
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
ground and get employees to go somewhere
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
the um the $120 million is a floating
 
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
number we were fortunate as can
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
be to have so much arpa funds and
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
everything else this time I I would
 
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
predict those days are gone and we are
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
and we are getting to a point going
 
02:39:56.429 --> 02:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
forward that it's going to become a much
 
02:39:59.269 --> 02:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
more difficult decision what we spend
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
our money in when we our needs are here
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
and our amount of money to work with
 
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
here it's the same thing with our
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
roadways so I I wouldn't be hung up on
 
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
that right now but that is going to
 
02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
become the much the much greater to me
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
the treasurer saying we can stretch and
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
we can do it but it it would be like me
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
sitting here and saying next year or
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
whoever is sitting in this fine chair
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
right here to say well if we if we could
 
02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
go from 120 and we pushed it we added 17
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
million onto it but because over the
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
years it's it's ebed and flowed uh but I
 
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be sitting here saying
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
we can keep adding $40 million so uh I'm
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not worried about that point the
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer is going to do even a better
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
selling job to keep us afloat here so
 
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
with that further comment repr clud okay
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you a question of the
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
chair just to clarify we let's say we
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
pass this bill today and the house for
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
gives it preliminary approval then it
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
goes to finance so and assuming Finance
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
looks at it and decides to go with it
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
then we've approved 40 million for
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
design now the question is that design
 
02:41:16.110 --> 02:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
work will take a while to do do you
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate that next year for the
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget those of us return are
 
02:41:22.349 --> 02:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
going to have possibly have to struggle
 
02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
with how or or if it's not next year the
 
02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
following year because we're in the off
 
02:41:29.469 --> 02:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
year how to do the rest of the prison
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
construction project uh so in other
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
words may looking at something outside
 
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
the regular in
 
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
2026 depending on how things go
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
I represent clud I think that's that's a
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
fair fair
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
assessment um this challenge is a huge
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
number and I and I think the treasurers
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
laid it out well we could we could not
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
fit this into our regular budget and
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to take uh it's going to
 
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
take greater minds not only in our house
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
but those people on the other side to
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
pull this together uh think think back
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
to um uh the money U the four four Cent
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
increase in the gas tax and how we we we
 
02:42:19.469 --> 02:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
term that funding which allows us Runs
 
02:42:20.429 --> 02:42:20.439 align:start position:0%
Out in
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
2026 and I apologize for not having that
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bill in front of me but by only
 
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
paying the interest and not paying the
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
principal we benefited instead of 250 to
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
500 miles of uh reconstruction or
 
02:42:37.469 --> 02:42:37.479 align:start position:0%
repaving of roads and bridges and
 
02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
everything else it's going to take
 
02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:41.550 align:start position:0%
everything else it's going to take
far-reaching

02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
far-reaching
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
policy to get us there because you know
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
we can't absorb this and I so we're
 
02:42:52.269 --> 02:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
we're we're coming that time rep Mark so
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
a followup so you probably may be
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
looking at and I know talking with the
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
treasurer and listening to her we could
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
maybe have to finance this at least over
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
a 20 to 30 year and 40e period that
 
02:43:04.990 --> 02:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like what would be to me
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
depending on I I I I think that
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
discussion's open and that that very
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
well may be represent Jackie thank you
 
02:43:13.710 --> 02:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just remind everyone that the way
 
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
we do B we don't once bonding's
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
authorized we don't immediately jump out
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
and sell those bonds the treasure
 
02:43:23.469 --> 02:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
determines based on cash flow when we
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
need to issue bonds we typically only do
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
it once a year and that covers the cash
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
flow that's required so it's not let we
 
02:43:33.469 --> 02:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be thinking that we're
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
immediately going to go out and bond the
 
02:43:40.349 --> 02:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
5% thank you represent Ms I just got one
 
02:43:42.510 --> 02:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
other thing and it goes back to
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative fauler saying for eight
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
years we've been kicking this can down
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
the road back to when Marty and I first
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
got on this committee and went to the
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
prison if we would have acted on it back
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
then that 10 years we would now be at
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
the ribbon cutting of the new prison
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
today instead of even considering this
 
02:44:01.630 --> 02:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
now so keep in mind everything we do
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
today is is all about moving this
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
project forward and getting it finished
 
02:44:06.359 --> 02:44:07.429 align:start position:0%
project forward and getting it finished
