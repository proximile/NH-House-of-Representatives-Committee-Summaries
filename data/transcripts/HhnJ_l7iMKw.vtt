that biological sex is more important
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
than gender identity by asserting a need

raised concerns that transgender people
 
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
were a threat to privacy in spaces where
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
people reasonably expect privacy like
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and locker rooms in the nearly

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
and for the same reasons as anyone else
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
and equally value safety privacy and

the restroom just like anyone else

transgender people can have incl access
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
to inclusion in these spaces after they

have had gender affirming medical

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
fit into as adults if we believe in the
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
autonomy of every individual to freely
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
make decisions regarding their own
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
bodies and lives we must recognize that
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
many people do not fit in the boxes they
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
are assigned at Birth I am happy um this
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I sent to the
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee um at the previous original
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm happy to resend it to um
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
the group gathered here today by email
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
question uh can you state your name once
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
again I missed that my name is Lind jow
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
WS thank you um you also stated a few
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
statistics there a moment ago relative
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
to how
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
many are born with um not fitting into
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
well into either roles of male and
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
female I missed the numbers could you
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
repeat those again sure it's uh one in
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
1,500 to 2,000
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
people and and where did that statistic
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
come from please um I don't have a
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
source on that um from what I'm reading
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
right now but I can get that to you by
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
email and would that be um how
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
dramatic um a
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
differential in this regard would that
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
be relative to an average of those one
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
to to 1500 or the one to
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
2,000 um I don't know how many interex
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
individuals currently reside in New
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but when we're making public
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
policy we should H keep in mind the wide
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
spectrum of human experiences and not
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
assume that people fit into only two
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
categories and the last question the 1
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
to 1500 or the 1 to 2,000 is that a New
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire figure or Regional figure or a
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
United States figure or a worldwide
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
figure that's a national figure National
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else in the public
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.550 align:start position:0%
 
speak

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh my name is Courtney
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
Reid and I serve as policy Advocate with
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
the American civil liberties Union of
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I just wanted to Echo
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the uh statements of concern
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
about this bill that uh my colleague
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
Lind Jake house had expressed um I left
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
a handout for folks uh so I'm just going
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
to largely touch on some of the main
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
points um for your uh reference there uh
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
foremost uh the ACLU is concerned that
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would function to undermine uh
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
existing protections for granite Staters
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um mostly the uh
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
nondiscrimination act that uh Lind had
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that was passed in
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
2018 um which had banned discrimination
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
based on gender identity uh in areas of
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
employment public accommodation and
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
housing uh but beyond um New Hampshire's
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
own laws to protect gender identity um
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
we've also seen uh Supreme Court rulings
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
at the federal level BOS V cleton County
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh which serve to protect discrimination
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
against gender identity in employment uh
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
specifically but uh a lot of federal
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
agencies have come to interpret this
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
ruling to also affect other areas such
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
such as um in schools uh affecting Title
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
9 um what this bill would do would send
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
a harmful message for folks whose gender
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
identity is not the same as their natal
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
sex whether that
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
be creating some sort of invasive or uh
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
surveillance procedure to ensure that
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
folks fit neatly into one box to perhaps
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
use a restroom facility or a locker room
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
or perhaps even affecting uh prison
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
settings um which other Advocates who
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with uh have also expressed
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
concern about the implications that uh
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
should local jails and prisons decide to
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
utilize this law they could also be
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
undermining priia the prison rape
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
elimination act uh in that uh prisons
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
and jails may not be
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh providing accommodations for uh
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary folks so not
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
only um could this affect their
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
placement but also uh potentially the
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
need to shower safely and separately
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
from other inmates or the need for um
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
menstruation products and
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
whatnot um and I just wanted to Echo
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
that uh the bill is hostile and serves
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
to just further alienate transgender
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
individuals and that by excluding trans
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
and gender nonconforming individuals in
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
sports or in other areas of life were
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
sending a message that they're not
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
worthy of the same kinds of
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities as classmates or
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues and that the folks who this
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill would be affecting need support an
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
affirmation and not to be a political
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
Target um and like I said uh I'm open to
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
taking questions but I I think a lot of
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
the information I'm hoping to get across
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
is in this handout thanks does anyone
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Stapleton thank
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
question your handout here and uh
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
testimony may I ask if that was based on
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill or um
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
considering one or both of the two
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
amendments that followed in in sessions
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh committee
sessions

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
um I would have to get back to you on
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
that I believe this is about the
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
original bill but
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
um because there there were two um
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendments a um Lyn
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um which was number
 
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.590 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um which was number
20233

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
20233
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
61h of uh May
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
7th and then there was a following perz
 
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
7th and then there was a following perz
Amendment

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
20230 441
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
H well that's also dated uh 507 of uh
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
2023 M and substantial changes
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
amendments were made to the original
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
Bill focused on protecting
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and uh enabling U
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
much of what you site in there uh to be
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
Express and protected but with the
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
ability to recognize biological sex um
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
in facilities where appropriate and
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
needed now you need to take a look at
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
those two amendments because I think
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to find uh some vast
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
Improvement um against what your
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
original testimony is that's just my
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
opinion but um I'm directing you to look
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%

amendments thank yeah uh I appreciate

back to you thank
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
am the I represent Hillsboro County
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%

houseville
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
396 um I I guess I wanted to take a few
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
moments today
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
to reiterate the the reason that this
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary this bill is necessary
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
Clarity to me the law is
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
clear however to a number of others it
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
is not that includes for example the um
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
the US District
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
Courts the 11th circuit court has upheld
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
a Florida law
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
that um allows school districts to um to
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
segregate bathrooms based on biological
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
sex the fourth Circuit Court um ruled
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
that a similar law in Virginia was a
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
violation of anti-discrimination
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
law even our own Department of Justice
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire seems
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
to have an ambivalent view on this topic
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
they voiced their opposition to House
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 396 on the basis that it uh did not
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
conform to our state's
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws um and yet they
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
also exercise um discretion in
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
segregation of prisoners in um
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
in um New Hampshire prisons um so they
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
you know by their own testimony address
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
cases on a case-by Case
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
basis um and so you know I I I guess I
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
would say that that there is a lack of
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
clarity in this battle is really being
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
played out in a lot of school districts
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
around the state um that's costing a lot
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
of money it's costing a lot of time uh
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the bigger concern of course is that
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I I believe violating the
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
the rights of um young students many who
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
are going through um changes in their
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
lives um who want to be able to um use
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
the bathroom or the locker
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
room um in uh
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know in in privacy and um and and
 
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
you know in in privacy and um and and
modesty

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
modesty
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
so this is actually playing out in a
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
number of school districts around the
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
state one of those is uh happens to be a
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
school district that uh my my house
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
district includes and that is the mic
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
School District so new whip switch being
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
the largest town in that school district
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
um is in my district and um there you
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
know we heard testimony at the
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill from a mother
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
in Milford who's who herself is a victim
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
of sexual violence and you know
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
tearfully told us that she is simply
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
trying to protect her daughter and give
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
her daughter an opportunity to um you
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
know to to use the locker room or the
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
restroom um with a feeling of privacy
 
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.190 align:start position:0%
restroom um with a feeling of privacy
and

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.789 align:start position:0%
and
security

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
um the same situation is playing out now
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
in the scenic School District it's
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
playing out in other school school
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
districts and what has happened there is
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the attorneys who the the school
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
district's Law Firm has come and said
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
well you know our interpretation of the
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
law is that you have to allow this
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
biological male who is identifying as as
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
a female to use the girls locker room
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
and the girls
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
restroom um there are other legal
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
experts and as I said the 11th Circuit
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
Court affirms this opinion
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
who say that it is not
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um I would I would also
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact I think one of the
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
previous um people who spoke
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
um compared this to discrimination or
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
brought up the topic of discrimination
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
in employment this bill has nothing to
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
do with discrimination in employment um
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination in employment is is
 
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.750 align:start position:0%
discrimination in employment is is
entirely

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
illegal uh it would remain illegal if
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
this bill were to move forward and pass
 
00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
this bill were to move forward and pass
um

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
so you know I I think the the you know
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
there also is a characterization of this
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill as being
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
hostile um you know I take exception to
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
that I I really think that the um the
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental question is can we can we
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
all get along and um you know I I think
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that calls for a a mutual respect
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is not intended to be
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
disrespectful nor have I ever
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
um have I ever expressed an erir of
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
hostility in in talking about why this
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
necessary um I I think this is common
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
sense a couple of uh years ago we were
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
we were you know everybody was using
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
that the me too hashtag and talking
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
about how important it is to protect
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
women um and and I do not believe for a
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
moment that every transgender person is
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
is uh in fact I think the vast majority
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
of transgender people um are they just
 
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.029 align:start position:0%
of transgender people um are they just
want

00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
to get along and fit in and and be
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
respected and I appreciate
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
that what I you know what I'm concerned
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
about is these cases in which the lack
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
of clarity in the law has provided a
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
basis for um what I would call undue
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
license where we have people going
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
into uh a girl's bathroom or locker room
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
taunting and making fun of young girls
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
who are going through puberty and who
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
are embarrassed about their bodies at
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
that point in life to begin with um and
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
this simply says let's acknowledge that
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing as biological
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
sex and
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
that separation of bathrooms and locker
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
rooms and prisons and athletic
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
competitions um based on biological sex
 
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
is reasonable and allowable it does not
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
dictate that it does not tell school
 
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
districts or the
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
doj what they have to do it simply
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
provides some clarity and says that in
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
if you do distinguish based on
 
00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
if you do distinguish based on
biological

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
biological
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
sexs that is
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
not that is not um discrimination that
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
that would be um violating our
 
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
that would be um violating our
anti-discrimination

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
laws thank you thank you representative
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you madam chair thank
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
risk there's actuality and then there's
 
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.389 align:start position:0%
risk there's actuality and then there's
risk

00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
um is am I correct to assume that what
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
you're pointing
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
at is the risk that is opened up and
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
made present by um the open use of the
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
public facilities especially in
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
school and that risk is a concern to
 
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
school and that risk is a concern to
many

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
people and it's a valid concern for
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
possible danger even as few of an
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
incident that might be occurring because
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
of open
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
facilities I see in the in the public
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
venue many in businesses are um opening
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
their toilet facilities to um both
 
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.710 align:start position:0%
their toilet facilities to um both
gender

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
gender
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
use and some
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um you don't have many facilities so um
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but it seems to be
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
pretty ubiquitous that that's happening
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
all around and I thought occurred to me
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
the question occurs to me is why
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't schools keep their biological
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
separation for safety
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
modesty security
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
propriety and provide um another
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
facility whether it be from the teachers
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
lounge or whatever for those who uh
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
whose gender their identity doesn't fit
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
them well for either or the male or
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
female um Can can you give me
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
some feedback on on those ideas and and
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
that question about
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
risk thank you for the for the question
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
so on the as to the first question I
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
mean we heard in testimony a few minutes
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
ago about the need for um transgender
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
people in in a prison setting for
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
example to be able to shower or use the
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
bathroom in
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
safety um and I do not for moment deny
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
that there are incidents of violence
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
against transgender
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
people um having said that there are
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
also incidents of sexual assault when
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
you put biological males and females
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
together es especially um you know young
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
people uh teenagers and so forth so I I
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
do believe that there that is present I
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
would say even if that were not present
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think that there is an issue of of
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
modesty and privacy that we ought to
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge as to the other question um
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
I would I I think we need to be careful
 
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
I would I I think we need to be careful
about

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
you if you designate certain bathrooms
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
as being or transgender people that is a
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
kind of that that's that kind of fits
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
the separate but equal which is not
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
which which is not an
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable approach to dealing with with
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
people of different groups the
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
acceptable approach would be to say we
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
have a a bathroom for biological males
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
whatever your gender identity is if you
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
are a biological male you may use that
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
restroom we have a separate restroom for
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
biological females whatever your gender
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
identity is you can use that one and we
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
have single use restrooms that any and
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
this is the key part that anyone may
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
use um whether you are a transgender not
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
transgender doesn't matter anyone may
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
use but that essentially tells everybody
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
you you you have the same you're all in
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
the same situation you're to use the
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
restroom that corresponds to your
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
biological sex or if you prefer whoever
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
you are if you prefer you can use one of
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
the single use
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
restrooms thank you may I have a
 
00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:05.950 align:start position:0%
restrooms thank you may I have a
followup

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
y um with prior
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I um made reference to two
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
amendments that followed on top of your
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh the Lyn
 
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.070 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh the Lyn
Amendment

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and then the Perez Amendment had you
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to review either th
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
of those and can you give some comment
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
on how that may support your bill or
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
detract from
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question so I have
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
reviewed them both I don't I'm I'm
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
trying to recall the Perez Amendment the
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Lyn amendment I believe was focused
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
on the athletic competition
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
portion um and it made some changes to
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
the language surrounding athletic um
 
00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:00.950 align:start position:0%
the language surrounding athletic um
athletic

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
athletic
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
competitions um and I I think that was
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
an entirely acceptable change um I I
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
remember that I I I don't recall the the
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
details of the Perez
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you yeah the Perez
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment um Incorporated uh much of the
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
Lynn Amendment and then made some slight
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what that was but the
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
change portion of the um both the Lynn
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
and the Perez amendments which are are
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
identical in uh they they um add in
 
00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:54.029 align:start position:0%
identical in uh they they um add in
Roman

00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
2 the general court also finds that that
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding New Hampshire's
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental commitment to treat all
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
persons without
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
discrimination and with equal dignity
 
00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.430 align:start position:0%
discrimination and with equal dignity
and

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
respect which commitment the legislature
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
fully accepts and strongly
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
endorses there are certain limited
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which classification of
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
persons based on biological sex is
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
proper because such classification
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
serves the compelling State interest of
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
protecting the priv privacy rights and
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
others the legislature finds that
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
permitting classification of persons
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
based upon biological sex serves this
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest in the three
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances described in RSA
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
25A that is the substantial change of uh
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendments do you find
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
that helpful objectionable um or without
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
effect thank you I I I certainly think
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
it it underscores the intent that is
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
already there in the bill so I think
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's helpful um the language I was
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
recalling from the from the linnn
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
amendment had to do with athletic
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
competitions pertaining to speed and
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
strength if my memory serves me
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
correctly um so I believe that that was
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
potentially another change in that one I
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
do want to comment though on um the the
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
statement in what you just read that a
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
proper in speaking to some members of
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
the transgender Community what I heard
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill is you know you will
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
never get anybody in the transgender
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
Community to support any bill that uses
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
the phrase biological
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
sex um because there is a um and I am
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing here um but there there
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
there is a um a desire not to
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that biological sex is is a
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
valid basis
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
for classification at all and um that I
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
think I mean we we heard again we heard
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
testimony a few minutes ago saying well
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
this bill erases intersex people um I
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
think generally speaking when we make
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
law we try to um be specific enough but
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
we we also try not to
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
um to make law based around um outliers
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and exceptions and um
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
the you know the the concern that I have
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
here is actually
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a move of foot to to erase
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the the reality that there are men
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
and women boys and girls in the world
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
world and that much of our society is
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
organized along those lines I think that
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
we can be open to people stepping into
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
different roles we can be respectful of
 
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.790 align:start position:0%
different roles we can be respectful of
people

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
who have a different gender identity
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
than that which with they were with
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
which they were
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
born but the fundamental reality is you
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
know still that people are born one way
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
or another way and on occasion you know
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
there there is some ambiguity with in
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
the case of intersex people but you know
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
that that I think the the the statement
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
that a distinction the distinction based
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
on biological prep uh sex is a proper
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
distinction is fundamentally what this
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
about thank you so if I if I get that
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
respect for
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of the many
 
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.390 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of the many
qualifiers

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
qualifiers
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
sex gender religion ethnicity so forth
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
this all fits within that realm of um of
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
respect um of people because we we
 
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
respect um of people because we we
talked

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
talked
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
about the athletic aspect
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go through there there
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
is a new section in that just to get a a
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
basis for uh understanding about what
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
we've talked about very short uh it's on
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the new
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
section um it cited your reference to
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
the athletic of course in Roman 2 do you
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
have any further um thoughts uh hearing
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
that um reflecting on that relative to
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
the the only the only thing I would
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
point out is that that
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
um extends the bill to private
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
organizations the original bill is aimed
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
specifically at the state and
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state so it affects
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
prisons and public schools
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
essentially um so it expands the scope
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
um I would leave it to
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
legal opinions and I'm sure we would
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
hear legal opinions on both sides of the
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
issue as to whether or not um that makes
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
it you know whe whether or not that that
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
is likely to uh to hold up in the courts
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
and as I've stated earlier even the sort
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
of the view the view of of bathroom
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
policies in schools relative to Title 9
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
has been treated differently by
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
different us circuit courts um and the
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has refused to hear on the
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh fourth circuit they they've refused
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
to hear that case so the fourth circuit
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
decision as as of now
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
stands for for Virginia and the 11th
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
circuit decision stands for
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
Florida a different 180 degrees
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
different it's a difficult subject and I
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for um your testimony and
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
reflection on my questions and on the
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
just uh on the amendment just read we
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
try to do uh the best we can in respect
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
for all people but we do want to keep
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
the safety privacy
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
modesty uh and risk element down for a
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
great amount of of people in our
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
biological reality thank you thank you

either of those
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendments um based on what I recall and
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
what I've heard today I don't believe

that either of those amendments
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%

00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
think you know there's some many things
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
our opinions are different and it
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be anything long I just
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
think just a short of what our
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation is in our opinion would
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
do it uh would you please let me know
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
this um I would agree with that um that
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Al let say look things over
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit more carefully and then um
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
come back um maybe with a summation um
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent present and maybe to the um
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and then for us all
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
to decide on there do you feel we should
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
have another work session or we just may
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
give our opinion at the full
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
hearing when we do the executive session
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to see possibly another
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
meeting okay I'll see if we can work one
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
in because I think it's what in nove the
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
first part of November that we have our
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and I'll see what we
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
can do okay representative testman what
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
bill the amendments are okay but basic
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
bill is okay also do you think we should
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
have another work
 
00:45:56.839 --> 00:45:59.109 align:start position:0%
have another work
session

00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
Stapleton I too am in favor of the bill
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
as amended with uh the per the Lynn and
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
Perez amendments but namely the Perez
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendments because that followed the
 
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.190 align:start position:0%
amendments because that followed the
Lynn

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and as we heard in testimony
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
it does not detract from challenge the
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
original intent of of the original
 
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.790 align:start position:0%
original intent of of the original
author's

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
author's
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I think we've considered this
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
long enough and I am not in favor of uh
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
any further work sessions uh I'm
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a motion that um we
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
recommend the passage of uh uh recommend
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
that the uh committee um passed this
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh based on the uh Perez Amendment
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
motion okay all in favor pre please
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and they're in favor of
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
the motion to recommend to the committee
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
opposed may I ask um how many um other
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
people in our subcommittee are here or
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
are not here today okay Chris
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Perez she's not here she
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
had to go she went to Canada and
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
here so we have a vote of 3 to one to
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
recommend that this bill with the
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
Amendments pass to the full committee
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee be passed and so
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else if somebody wants
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we close this
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
so anybody second that question before
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
your second excuse me
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
um as you point out that u w with our
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation to for passage of the
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
bill it does not preclude further
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to be presented to the full
 
00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
committee that they could consider
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
so um I think moving this forward uh is
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
expedient for process and uh getting the
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill through committee and then getting
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
it to the floor I that's why I voted um
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
to support the bill with the Perez
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
amendments so that we did not have
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
further delay as we end up this year and
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
go into the next year of our
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
term uh thank you I agree with that my
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
thing on House Bill 396
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
is to get it to the full house because
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned that's where it
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
belongs let the Full House debate it
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
it's 400 people and then let them vote
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
on it and you know what either be yes or
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
