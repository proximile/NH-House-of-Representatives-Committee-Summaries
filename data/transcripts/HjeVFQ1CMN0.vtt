00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
the one o'clock i'm going to call the
 
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session for senate
 
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill 282
 
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
to order and just a little bit of
 
00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
background which everybody may know but
 
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.430 align:start position:0%
background which everybody may know but
um

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
so we had um house bill 1192 on this
 
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.869 align:start position:0%
so we had um house bill 1192 on this
subject

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
that passed the house it went to the
 
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
senate it passed the senate and
 
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
their committee and then the full senate
 
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
passed it on consent yesterday
 
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.790 align:start position:0%
passed it on consent yesterday
so

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is after going through you
 
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
know the enroll bill process will be
 
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to the governor and i don't see
 
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
any reason why
 
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't sign it um
 
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then we got senate bill 282 which is
 
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
his work session with four and
 
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the intent had been for it to be
 
00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
identical to 1192 there's one sentence
 
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's different um
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
i came here with an amendment we can
 
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
discuss other options with an amendment
 
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
but all that amendment did would be to
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
make the two identical
 
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
but after talking to the chair uh
 
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
carol mcguire she said
 
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
if you know rather than do that if if
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're fine with what was in 1192 the
 
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
best thing would just be to itl
 
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 282 because we don't need
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
two bills on the same topic
 
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.789 align:start position:0%
two bills on the same topic
um

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
so anybody else in the subcommittee want
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
to say anything
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
i i agree with that assessment although
 
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
if there are changes that we want to
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
make to the statute
 
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
we could do so we could just build a
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do that but we would have to
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
write a contingency such that uh
 
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
whatever we pass out of
 
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
only takes effect after right actually
 
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the carol said that she said
 
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
if we want to make further changes her
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to
 
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
um have an amendment to replace all of
 
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
um have an amendment to replace all of
282

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
282
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
and had a later effective date than
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
1192. so yeah
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
so there wouldn't be a question of which
 
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
one took precedence so thanks
 
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can make the effective date whenever
 
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
you want and then put four one uh
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
minute after
 
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.350 align:start position:0%
minute after
two

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
sure later
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that's how all that takes care of us
 
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right and i would recommend
 
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.670 align:start position:0%
okay all right and i would recommend
that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
you start with 11 magnitude since that's
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
the thing that's past those bodies i
 
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.350 align:start position:0%
the thing that's past those bodies i
agree

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and rather than trying to
 
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i think we should look at that
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
and if we need to amend that and we
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
return this
 
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
use that
 
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
as senator 2h would pass it
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right i agree
 
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we should work off of uh 282
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually if you can turn the mic on and
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
have your uh the mic quite close to your
 
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
have your uh the mic quite close to your
mouth

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm molly gendro and i represent the
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
association the new hampshire
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and asian medicine
 
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.949 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and asian medicine
association

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm diane chase i'm a vice chair on
 
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire acupuncture licensing
 
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire acupuncture licensing
board

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
i represent
 
00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.149 align:start position:0%
i represent
myself

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
as an acupuncturist who's been impacted
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
by our law dramatically and in
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
negatively and that's why i approach to
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
i'm elizabeth rob i'm a community
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist there are no community
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists who sit on the licensing
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
board so there's no one who represents
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
my co-workers and myself we have a
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
distinctive approach of doing things
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm with the
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
people's organization of community
 
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
people's organization of community
acupuncture

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
we again we have a different approach
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
than say private room acupuncturists and
 
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are aspects of this law that make
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
it hard for people to get licensed in
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we want to make that
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
easier like reciprocity easier
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
could you briefly give us some idea of
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between what a community
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
acupuncture it is versus other types yes
 
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy too so
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
in community acupuncture clinics instead
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
of putting patients in a single room
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
by themselves and treating them on a
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
treatment table we have an open
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
community space we're often treating
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
patients in reclining chairs it's like a
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
big living room and we pray
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
we mostly use distal points to treat
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
patients so if you were to come in say
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
and get a treatment for your back i
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put the needles directly in
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
your back i would just have you sit in a
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
reclining chair roll up your pant legs
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
to your knees your sleeves to your
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
elbows and i would use points in your
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
arms and hands legs and feet head and
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
ears to treat your back pain you know
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
using the meridians that run through
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
your back and what we do is um we've we
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
do this at a reduced cost so how much is
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
private room acupuncture
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
can you want to give a range
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
so so a private room clinic might be 55
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
to 155 dollars 25 125. so the clinic
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
where i work we charge a sliding scale
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
of 20 to 40 dollars patients choose what
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
they want to pay
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
um there's a you know we're just a
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
different group we just have a different
 
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.790 align:start position:0%
different group we just have a different
approach

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
and we tend to be bigger clinics with
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
more practitioners keeping open flexible
 
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
more practitioners keeping open flexible
hours

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
so what i'm getting is i mean except
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm using needles
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know some of those terms that
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're using is it a matter
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
i thought you said you weren't in those
 
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.309 align:start position:0%
i thought you said you weren't in those
types

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
types
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
oh not in the back
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay i don't necessarily know what
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
meridian's a leg are and you got to
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
assume that we know nothing other than i
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
know what a needle is okay
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
so in the community if i could speak in
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the community acupuncture room people
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
are in recliner chairs in their clothes
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
like when i was trained i was trained to
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
put somebody into a hospital gown and
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
then have them lay on the table
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
right and that's
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
frequently how private room acupuncture
 
00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
frequently how private room acupuncture
happens

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
but in community you're not taking your
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
clothes off in the group
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
what we can do here is he says as we
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody in the committee
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
feels there need to be changes and but
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
we we could deal with that first and
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
then what i'd like to do
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
is um you know we can talk about any
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i just want to i
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
looked through
 
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
looked through
the

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
made 1192 a hybrid between 1192 and 282.
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
would anybody else concur that that's
 
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.230 align:start position:0%
would anybody else concur that that's
what

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.590 align:start position:0%
what
happened

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
the senate didn't change 1192 after it
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
left our committee
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay so these are the changes that it
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
left our committee with that's correct
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
okay thank you right uh representative
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
marsh uh
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
brought forward an amendment that was
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
intended to make
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh 1192 the same as 282
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
there was one sentence that somehow
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
ended up being different right we were
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
asked by the board to make an additional
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
change which we incorporated in our
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment uh at the time so that's where
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
we left it okay what change was that do
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know i can't i can't keep track i'm
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out which change
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
yes uh it it's in in fact if you look at
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative league
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
has brought forward mm-hmm
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
this was the additional change that we
 
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
this was the additional change that we
made

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
to 1192
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
after uh while it was in our commitment
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
right i mean there's one of them is a
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
word order change that isn't i don't
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
think significant but the key is
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
it adds um at the end there
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
let's hold about license to practice
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
acupuncture from another uh no no that's
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
not the one that's it's got another
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's got nc aom including if successors
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
or predecessors it's the main change is
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh adding that including its successors
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
or predecessors which was in other
 
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
or predecessors which was in other
places

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
in 282 and 1192 but it wasn't um one was
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's what this was intended to
 
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
and so that's what this was intended to
fix

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i make a suggestion
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
certainly uh can i suggest we look at
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
the board's draft here
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning and see which
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
sections are already and what has passed
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
what things might be new and what
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
whether we think that this is a
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable change or whether we think
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's something that really ought to have
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and be a bill next year
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay um if
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
as far as a way of doing if you'd like
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
to go through it
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i would like to do it that way because
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
i think that that will accomplish what
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good idea
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
so looking at this draft legislation the
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
first part seems to change the word
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
oriental to the word asian in a number
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any objection to that
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
i'm taking a look at
 
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.949 align:start position:0%
i'm taking a look at
[Music]

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
1192 and i'd look through here and i'm
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing oh so this is changing other
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
parts of the rsa that's right then
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
what's touch they're asking us to change
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
some other parts
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
which would be germaine certainly okay
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
and if they want to change oriental to
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
asian i don't have any objection to
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
doing that
i

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
since it costs the state of new
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire about ten thousand dollars to
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
bring a bill forward if we can do that
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
now we end up saving the state money
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's a relatively minor
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
thing like that so all right i would
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
certainly be be in favor of doing that
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a change if that's what people
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
want to do i agree and looking through
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
the uh part one that's all that's in
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
there and in part two
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh section two in uh
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
four that's what's there
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
and then in uh six
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
actually is this one changed in our bill
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
g2 well section one is no section two is
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
new which also
 
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
new which also
is

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
oriental to asian and adds
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
the change to ac a
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
hm and
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
ncc aom and including its predecessors
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and successors again
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
i don't see those as being anything that
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
anyone objects to
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
no and uh
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
so we're going through here if anybody
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
has a problem with any of these you know
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
right if we go to section three
 
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
right if we go to section three
um

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
the significant change there i believe
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
is already in what was passed which
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
says no more than two section terms that
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
is in section three
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill that's already passed
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
is there any difference here between
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
roman numeral one
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
number one where we strike out
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
b n c c a o
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
our bill or their no i'm looking at
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
their bill okay yes
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
hold a current valid license to practice
 
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
hold a current valid license to practice
acupuncture

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's in 1192 on page 1 lines 14
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
through 17.
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay so i believe this whole section
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
three is
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
something that's already been done
 
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.269 align:start position:0%
something that's already been done
yep

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
yep
agree

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
moving on to section four um
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that this section again is
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
something that we've already addressed
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for exactly where i think
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's at the beginning uh section one of
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
deals with 329.99
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
actually all that the bill does is for
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
what does this actually change
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we've got the chain
 
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we've got the chain
[Music]

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
e12

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay so the the the section of section
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
four of the amendment that we received
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
is similar to
 
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.350 align:start position:0%
is similar to
page

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
right it's got the uh on a reached age
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
of majority that's fine and b
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
it has the nca om certification or
 
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.069 align:start position:0%
it has the nca om certification or
equivalent

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
he talks about the
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
licensing fee it talks about
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
professional character and it up to line
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
10 whose requirements are simply equal
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
to or exceed the requirements of
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
so section 4 is in the bill that passed
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
the senate and section 4.
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly you know even going down
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship is looking to be
 
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship is looking to be
basically

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
correct okay but the
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
b has a major problem it actually took
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
out the very point of what i initiated
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
which one
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
line b
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
what was originally struck was the
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
current active
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
no it's right here has current active n
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
c a o m yeah
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
we want to strike current active
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
because that requires that we pay dues
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
to our trade organization
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
in addition to our license well it says
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
or equivalent certification
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
approved by the board it's just the
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
current active great people should be
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
ncms ncc or certified
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
but if you don't pay the dues they will
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
not turn out your test results so you
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
can't get licenses in other states after
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i am required to pay a state
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
licensing fee and more for that ncac am
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
active stats i hear what you're saying
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
would not the board be able to approve
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
prior ncc aom certification that may not
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
be current and active as equivalent
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
certification if the board so desire
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
can you can you please repeat that oh
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
we've already inserted into statute here
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
or equivalent certification approved by
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
what is being contended here is that we
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
should strike the words current active
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that one only has to be ncc aom
 
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
so that one only has to be ncc aom
certified

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.789 align:start position:0%
certified
now

00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
would as an alternative would not
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
require any change in statute
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
would not the board be able to accept an
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
ncc aom certification
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
that is not current
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
because they didn't pay their dues
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
as being equivalent
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
ncc aom also requires a certain amount
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
of continuing education which is then
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
mirrored in quite a lot of the rest of
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill so i do believe maintaining it
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
understood so you could uh
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
have some other maintenance of
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
certification process that you approve
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
that if they did that and had a prior
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
ncc aom certification
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
that could at least hypothetically be
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the board
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
right or it might not even require prior
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
ncc home certification they could have
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
whatever the board could decide whatever
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
they want basically
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay so two things the the paragraph
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
about ceus the chair of the licensing
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
board has contested what's in here
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
because it implies that you can only get
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
it through nccumceus
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay so what's in here right now i
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
believe is one of the things that she
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
would like to change
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's number one number two
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
current active status if you've been
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
certified you have passed the test so
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
why you have to maintain and pay dues
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
when you've already passed the test to
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
prove your credibility and your
 
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.830 align:start position:0%
prove your credibility and your
competence

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
competence
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
why i should pay more than my licensing
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
fee every year for that i don't know and
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
i will further explain that the last
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
course i took for those ceus was in
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
astrology from the ncc aom website
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
so from here on out i'm taking astrology
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
classes because they offer a lot of them
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
so the new hampshire citizens can be
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
protected from me because i have learned
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
astrology okay actually actually
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
and we've had the same argument with
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
medical licenses and i had a bill to
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
that effect a couple of sessions ago so
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying
 
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying
um

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
but i i i was not did not prevail in
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
getting the the bottom line was the
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
public determined that some sort of
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
continuing education was considered in
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
the public interest and i respect that
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree i'm we we require in new
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire by law 30 ceus every two years
 
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire by law 30 ceus every two years
so

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine but paying the current
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
active status fee that is the problem i
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a question so uh does the
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
actually have a question so uh does the
board

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
um have anything specified for
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
continuing education other than
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
that required to maintain uh current act
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
of ncc om certification
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
so is there another option
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
has been the position all along in the
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
law and the board i'm asking right now
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to obtain your ceus
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other courses that
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
can be approved by the board and
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
accepted as appropriate continuing
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
education however
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
i would also caution that astrology
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
courses won't keep your ncc aom current
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
because there are ethics courses and
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
safety courses part of the requisites as
 
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.909 align:start position:0%
safety courses part of the requisites as
well

00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay but there
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
are there any um alternatives to ncclm
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the board has currently approved or
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
are there people who are licensed based
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
on that or is this just
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge we've not been asked to
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
do that ncc aom has been a pretty
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
standard right right now it's across the
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
board requirement
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes yeah i i believe that
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
we need to phrase this slightly
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
differently because existing law that
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying to amend here currently
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
says that they have to have a current
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
act of ncc aom certification
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
but we're adding into the law or the
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification right i get
 
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification right i get
that

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to rewrite their
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
rules and the question is are they going
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
to rewrite their rules to allow
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
alternative forms of continuing
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
education which i believe is the intent
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
right i see another thing here in 1192
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
on page 2 near the bottom on lines 35
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
and 36
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
under it's under continuing education
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
it says uh maintaining current active
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
nccm certification shall fulfill the
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirement
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't offer any alternative
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
down here
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.789 align:start position:0%
down here
yes

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
so this is um thank you this is this is
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
reminding me of the discussion that we
 
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
reminding me of the discussion that we
had

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
four years ago because one of the disc
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
one of the points
 
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
one of the points
that

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.549 align:start position:0%
that
several

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists were making at the time
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
was that the nca om ncc aom was the only
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
um recognized test and licensing
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and there and that's when we started
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
this ore equivalent
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that was accepted by both bodies and
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
then that was the house bill 1314. that
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
was one of the big points of 1314
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that bill passed the house and went
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
to the senate and got lost during covet
 
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.029 align:start position:0%
to the senate and got lost during covet
so

00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
when i saw this
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
i thought that that was
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of the important things so we if
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're saying that we're going to have
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
nca om certification or equivalent we
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that that
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
policy carries out throughout the bill
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
right and it looks like it doesn't cover
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
section five
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay um a couple different things
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
so it's been in our statute all along
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
that we need current active status with
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the ncc aom but it's also in our statute
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we need 30 ceus
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
every two years to renew our new
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire licenses
 
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.710 align:start position:0%
hampshire licenses
and

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
so that's 60 ceus every four years which
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we need for ncc aom so
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
i've had people turn in letters saying
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
that it's completely redundant and
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome on a small business owner to
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to keep this nccaom certification
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.149 align:start position:0%
in addition to
keeping

00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire license
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's they're already competing
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
completing the same amount of ceus for
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and submitting the proof
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
and the certificates and then
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
submitting the same proof and
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
certificates to the ncc aom this
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
national agency when we've already
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
passed their
 
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.590 align:start position:0%
passed their
right tests

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
right tests
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
actually it looks like i mean
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
even if we think the rest of the bill's
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
fine there's an inconsistency because to
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
get certification it appears you there
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
are options other there could be options
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
other ncclm but the way the bill's
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
written ncclm certification is the only
 
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
written ncclm certification is the only
way

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
to get renewed so that's a that is
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem and i believe in
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the rules california ceus are accepted
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct so it's not just ncca oh
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
i'm approved ceus also if we're adding
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
or equivalent certification if we're
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
accepting someone to new hampshire who's
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
taken the california acupuncture
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
licensing exam as their equivalent are
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
they then expected to maintain an active
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
license in california as their
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
equivalent approved certification that
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
mirrors ncc aom that wouldn't make sense
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's just you've taken
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
a test either ncc aom or equivalent and
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
right now that's the cali and then you
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
maintain your ces for the state of new
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire and then if you want to pay
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
ncc aom if you feel there's benefit to
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
ncc aom then that should be a choice not
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
a mandate by law
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
can i make a suggestion
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
because i i hear both sides here and i
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
think that you're making valid points
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
why don't we add
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of section five
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
where right now we we've struck some
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
language from the statute including the
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
30 continuing education hours that was
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
just mentioned and the sentence is
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining current active nc caom
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
certification shall fulfill the
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
continuing current education requirement
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
why don't we add a sentence right there
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
the board shall adopt rules regarding
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
alternative means of fulfilling the
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
continuing educational requirement
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
particularly since they already have
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that in the rules
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
that is in the board's amendment
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
that is the language as i said the chair
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
is for this
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
she testifies
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
um x on page four
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
of their the board's amendment as a
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
conditional renewal of license the board
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
shall require east licensing to show
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
proof of having completed for each
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
biennial period
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
continuing education at approved
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
institutions or as approved by the board
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay and the board the board does
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
approve other ceus every year there's an
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
annual meeting elizabeth and i both
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
served as board members on the
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
association in the past
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
um and i attended and got ceus at annual
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
meetings sponsored by the association
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the board so yes that does
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
happen so if we were to take this
 
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
happen so if we were to take this
language

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
in the middle of page towards the bottom
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
of page four number ten and use that to
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
replace the language in the bill for
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
section five yeah that's what we have
 
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
section five yeah that's what we have
everybody

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
yes everyone
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
yep okay all right let's do that that's
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
um you're sort of uh
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
driving the detail here would you be
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
willing to uh request the amendment uh
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to do the amendment here you
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
would like me to do so yes as long as we
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
reach consensus at the end of the day
 
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
reach consensus at the end of the day
obviously

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean probably the thing to do is
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
to have a uh
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
maybe have a marked up copy of alumni
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
1192 or something and then we can just
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
review it and then the subcommittee can
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
vote on whether we recommend that is
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
right my only issue is that my laptop
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't boot this morning so i uh
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
probably will
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay we'll do it
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to end this with a
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and further all right
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
so we got we got through the section
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
five here um
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually we were using the board
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
language to go through
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um section 5 of the board's language is
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
the next section of their proposed
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is the certified acupuncture
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
detoxification specialist my
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
recollection was this was already in the
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking on their amendment where
 
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.669 align:start position:0%
we're looking on their amendment where
their

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
328 g9a to read as follows
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
um so which page on there is it's that's
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page four okay and
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
elaine is saying this is already in in
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
what was passed by the house and the
 
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
what was passed by the house and the
senate

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm just looking for where to
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't print out the current
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute which i probably should have
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
done but they don't they're not changing
 
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.389 align:start position:0%
done but they don't they're not changing
anything

00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
except on the next page but that general
 
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.750 align:start position:0%
except on the next page but that general
supervision

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
yep okay so we don't need
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody think we need this
 
00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody think we need this
section

00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.909 align:start position:0%
section
no

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh oriental to asian yes so i think
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
that's fine yep
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
now i have a real problem with changing
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
the dentistry statue as part of this
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
because that makes it a non-german
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and that creates
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to say no for
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
section seven and uh
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
eight because we're not going to do that
 
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:30.230 align:start position:0%
eight because we're not going to do that
um

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
and at the end we have to have a
 
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
and at the end we have to have a
contingency

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
contingency
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes so we want to have this new
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment take place one minute after
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
the adoption of 11.92
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
what i would like to do
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
is because we have a couple new sections
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
where section 1 is new
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
section 2 is new
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
the paragraph
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
which is replacing what's already in the
 
00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.509 align:start position:0%
which is replacing what's already in the
bill

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
and number six is new so if we write if
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
we create a whole replaceable bill
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
to take effect one minute after what
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
just passed the senate yeah with just
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
that will work
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
and there's a question
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
um it's a comment
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way that this is written the current
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
act of nc
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
certification i do not believe the board
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
has the authority to ignore that
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes if you leave current active nccm
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
certification in there
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
well we could say
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
this is it's this part right here
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
can we just say has
 
00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
can we just say has
nca

00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
nca
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
certification or equivalent
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
has has ncc aom or equivalence
 
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.430 align:start position:0%
has has ncc aom or equivalence
certification

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah just take that that would work
 
00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.389 align:start position:0%
yeah just take that that would work
no

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
down here well the way it's read it says
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
has current nccem equivalent uh
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
certification or equivalence
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
certification approved by the board
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that gives them the she doesn't like
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
the word it's current active because
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
you it's the word current active because
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.509 align:start position:0%
you it's the word current active because
you

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
right it implies
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
that you have to have
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
current active ncaom certification
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
the or if you're using the right-hand
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
side of the ore then the left-hand side
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
is completely irrelevant i'm not opposed
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
to remove well
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
here's the problem
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
and why i'm not sure it's good to remove
 
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.149 align:start position:0%
and why i'm not sure it's good to remove
that

00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
what this is saying is that you have two
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
options here one is you have some
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification approved by the
 
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.549 align:start position:0%
equivalent certification approved by the
board

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
um and that's fine
 
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.909 align:start position:0%
um and that's fine
or

00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
if you had gotten the certification a
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
long time ago and it isn't currently
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
active that means you haven't had
 
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.630 align:start position:0%
active that means you haven't had
ongoing

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
training for that and you haven't kept
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
up and you're doing that instead of some
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
equivalent approved by the board so i
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that every state requires
 
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
don't know that every state requires
ceus

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
ceus
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
right period whether you're nccm
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
certified or not
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
and not all states require nccum
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
a number do not
 
00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
a number do not
and

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
maybe the majority do not require active
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
current status so mr chair and i'm
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
looking i'm going back because this is
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
like bringing me back
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
so in house bill 1314 we struck out
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
current active okay so we had has ncc
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
aom certification or equivalent
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
certification approved by the board or
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
has successfully passed the california
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture licensing examination
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
through examination or credential
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
document review so
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
we had taken the words current active
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
out i'm fine with that and i don't i
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
presumably don't need the ore california
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
thing because the board could
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
accept that if they wanted correct all
 
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
accept that if they wanted correct all
right

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i understand all of
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
california is now
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
requiring ncc aom they they moved
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
towards that
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the earlier argument i think they're
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
required to replicate
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
um duplicating your submissions for your
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
ceus if you have your ncca om active and
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
current the license
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
this actually made it a little bit
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
easier for a number of uh constituents
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
because you didn't have to strictly
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
adhere to 15 this two-year period or 30
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
this two-year period 30 this two-year
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
period as long as you had your 60 in
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
your four years and maintained your
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
current certification we as the board
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
can simply
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
go online and see that you are current
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
and active
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
and know that you're up to date
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably up to date on your
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
certification and your ceus you might
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
have only 13 in this two year period and
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
then 17 in the next and but as long as
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
it added up at the end of the four years
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
that was adequate i know in some states
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
like new massachusetts i was looking at
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
their laws this morning
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
it the dates must follow exactly you
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
take extra ceus before they're required
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
well that was good for you but it
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
here we it was actually allowing a lot
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
more flexibility as well as an ease on
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
the board of checking the ceu status of
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
somebody rather than requiring us to
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
look through every single applicant's
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
every single ceu submitted what but if
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
we took the requirement for current
 
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
we took the requirement for current
active

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the board presumably could
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
still for people who do have current
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
active certification look at that for
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
the education requirement yes and we're
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
not looking for that to be the only way
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
we were simply looking to add that as an
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
easiest way okay but taking the words
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
out of there i don't think will affect i
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a suggestion that i hope would make
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
everybody happy why don't we create
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
three ways
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
we can have current active ncc aom
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
certification which is probably what
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
you're gonna do most of the time
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
we have or equivalent certification
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
approved by the board which means you
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
can develop something else
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
and we can put in the middle or prior
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
ncc aom certification with documentation
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
of continuing education pursuant to rsa
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
328 g colon 9x which is the part we just
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
would that work for everybody i think
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's fine but it's also redundant yes
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's redundant it's boots it's it's
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
suspenders and bill that works sometimes
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
if it gets everybody to yes and we can
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
stop arguing about it i'm happy to do
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
this i just want to say that we actually
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
have a very good ceu policy
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that if you take more
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
than the amount you can apply them next
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
year i don't know any other state that
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
does that and that definitely helps
 
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.470 align:start position:0%
does that and that definitely helps
people

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
so i just want to inject some
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know so i just want to make sure i
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand the board is now going to be
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for setting up the
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines for an entire system of
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
standards that meet ncc aom
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
specifically no we're we're giving you
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
the option that if somebody comes in
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
with a prior certificate that is not
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
currently active and evidence that
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
they've kept up with their continuing
 
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
they've kept up with their continuing
education

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
which you already have a policy on and
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's elsewhere in the in the law that
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
then you can accept that for less
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay that was the third option but the
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
second one in between with the or the
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
fourth one is for equivalent
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
certification which means that if you
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
guys want to you can come up with some
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
other pathway in the rules that you
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
consider to be equivalent and we are
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
my last question is tony would you
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
prefer that i do this amendment as a
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
replace all and contain all the language
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
of the original bill or do it as just a
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
contingency that can take effect right
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
after the other bill to just make the
 
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
after the other bill to just make the
changes

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
i would suggest it just be easier to see
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
the changes if it only
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
included it was it basically became an
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that that uh just added the
 
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
amendment that that uh just added the
change

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
282 with the changes we're discussing
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
today and took effect later that would
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
be my preference and i'm happy to do it
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
that way i'll just go down to ols and do
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
this is just i don't know if this is
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
concerning but what if someone was
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
licensed here in new hampshire
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
they went through the nccom
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
certification then they took maybe 20
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
years away from practicing and now they
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
want to be renewed again is that then
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
they'd have to show
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
like 30 ceus and that they were once
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know certified by
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
ncpom my understanding is that your
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
policy currently is 30 ceus per year
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
with some flexibility so you can shift
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
things from one year to another so if
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
somebody took a 10-year break that means
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
that they would have to come up with 300
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
ceus which i suppose they could do if
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
they really worked at it okay
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think that makes sense
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay and um
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
what i'd suggest is um
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
if everybody who has an interest in this
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
could uh leave an email address then
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
maybe we can uh
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
let them see a copy of the amendment and
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would be glad to circulate it to a
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
list if people give me a list of email
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
addresses right and
 
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
addresses right and
uh

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
just a last check to make sure that way
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a sudden panic you guys can
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
jack if you could uh have your notebook
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
with their sign up and let up
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
the point that i made during testimony
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
which you weren't here the other day is
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
most people probably keep their nccm
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
active but some people want the choice
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
they don't feel
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
like the ncca
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
represents them
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
also the ncc iom is
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
a trade association or they're a
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
certifying body either way they're a
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
test agency that acts as a trade
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
association technically
 
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.069 align:start position:0%
association technically
and

00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
many of us feel very uncomfortable about
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
the salaries that they make considering
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
what acupuncturists make when we don't
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we don't feel like they represent us
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
so some people i'm probably going to
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
continue with my active certification
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
with them but i know several people in
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire who don't want to
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you that physicians feel
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way okay they're
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
licensing boards so okay you're not
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
and this isn't new i heard similar
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay is there
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
other than getting email addresses
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
any other points anyone wants to raise
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
either on the
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or
 
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or
not

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
i believe
that

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
make an amendment
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
before the meeting
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to meet again to
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment as a subcommittee
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
but we can do that
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
in one second right
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
so let's yeah right so i guess we're
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the whole committee is
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
meeting let me we've got a number of
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
meetings coming up monday and tuesday of
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
next week right now in the amendment now
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have it on monday
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
right we could we could do it monday or
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
or just to leave some time in case we
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
could we're meeting on
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
tuesday so
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
i could i could ask them to schedule
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
also needs to be some notice for the
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session so
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
i could put in a request to schedule one
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
for 9 30 in the morning on tuesday that
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
would be fine
 
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.910 align:start position:0%
would be fine
okay

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i recommend the people who are
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
attending the subcommittee meeting look
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment and then send your
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
comments to the chair
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that we all we have one depository
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
for all the comments
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
or or send it to the whole committee
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
email address so we'll see it as well oh
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right yep and if the amendment
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
is ready on monday and it gets emailed
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
out sometime monday
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
then there'd be a chance to
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
add any comments um before we vote on it
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then the whole committee could vote
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
if there are any comments on it um
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
given the time frame if they're not if
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a substantial issue
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'd rather not go through this again
 
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
i'd rather not go through this again
because

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to run out of time so
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
but if there's something seriously
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
broken then
 
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:29.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:36.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
and i'll send the email right after this
 
00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:41.349 align:start position:0%
and i'll send the email right after this
requesting

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
that that be scheduled so
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
all right if there's nothing else i will
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
close the subcommittee work session on
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
you
